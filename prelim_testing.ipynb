       "   'review': 'The mechanics of the game are way too visible to the player and it ruins immersion.   Basically every map is:  if you go left you need 7 lockpick skill to pass, go right for a 6 hack check, go straight for traps that need level 4 skill to disarm.  It\\'s fine to have skill checks like this but they should be hidden behind the scenes and masked by the story and atmosphere.  You aren\\'t going left because it has a lockpick 7 option, you are going left to help the help the princess.  You are going right to fight the dragon, not to use the level 8 hack check. \\n\\nThe characters attributes make no sense either.  Why is the best melee fighter build not prioritizing all the physical stats over mental?   \\n\\nYour characters dont have personality and archetypes like in other RPG games.  The dumb but strong tank, the quick but physically weak rogue/sniper, the smart tech user guy.   They are just carriers for passing various skill checks that have seemingly nonsensical stat point distributions.   \\n\\nI hate constantly thinking about how this map requires skill 7 hack, skill 6 lockpick, and skill 4 disarm to 100% clear.  \"I just need to gain +2 levels in hacking and +1 level in traps to finish this map\".    Instead I should be thinking:  \"Oh nice I think I can rescue the princess if I go to this map and convince the black knight to help me create a diversion.  That should distract the dragon enough for me to save her!\".  Instead its just numbers:   skill >6 = win.   Skill <6= lose.',\n",

       " \"This is my 4th playthrough of Witcher 3, played it thrice on GOG. You can already see where I am going with this review. \\nSprint! YES FINALLY! (DA:Inquisition still doesn't have it). Drink a werewolf decoction and run like the wind. Exploration is taken to another pedestal in Witcher 3. You can basically ditch your adopted daughter and explore the entire Kaer Morhen area in the first 15 mins of the game (provided you skipped the long ass cut-scene in the start). Not interested in fighting the Griffin ? No problem, go ahead and do the pan quest or the other beautifully written side quests in White Orchard or if you get easily intrigued, explore the questions marks on the map. These smart sneakily designed question marks encourage exploration and if you get bored of enjoying the sprint mechanic, call for Roach! Although that dumb broken horse gets annoying after a while. But...that's not it! White Orchard is just the first big  area you are introduced to after Kaer Morhen. Novigrad and Velen together will keep you busy for another 30 hours. (This is excluding the main quest) And Skellige Isles, my god, I have finished 150 hours on steam and am yet to explore the question marks of that area. On top of this, get the DLC, another new area for you to explore with an additional 50 hours of gameplay, bigger than most standalone titles. \\nWitcher 3 is a game which basically tells players to do whatever the hell you want to do and do it at your own pace. No damn thing will force you to go meet this guy or go help this dude find his sheep or goat or whatever. Just enjoy the spectacular environs and the mise en scene while you trot around on Roach. \\n\\nApart from the exploration and side quests, the skill tree provides with multiple options. If youre the kind of player who likes to use signs in combat, well...invest in the blue sign tree. If you are a player who loves to strategize with potions and oils and bombs, focus on the green alchemy tree, or if you want to be a mindless killing machine go forth with the red combat tree with some alchemy skills here and there. You can even unlock a new mutation system in the Blood and Wine DLC which makes Geralt even more stronger. (Choose Euphoria, its OP). And if you think sword play is getting mundane, well then go to the Runewright in the Hearts of Stone DLC and add some badass customizations to your armour and swords. Theres just too much content in Witcher 3 and if you dedicatedly immerse yourself in the world, doing every side quest, reading every book/bestiary entry/character info and playing every Gwent Game (fuck I didnt mention Gwent, just the most chillest past time of all, don't ignore it) exploring every question mark and finding all treasures, you'll probably find yourself dreaming of playing Witcher 4 but......sadly reality strikes and you get depressed knowing that this was the final addition to the series. \\n\\nThe world's immersion is just exquisite, the NPCs will change their behaviour based on the choices you make. The people react differently and constantly send remarks, making you realise that Witchers are like lepers, not welcomed and shunned by everyone. The sheer amount of emotions which you come across are just so well created, you hate some characters (bloody baron) but then you realise that they might be the lesser evil out of the rest which allows you to draw a conclusion. You are completely immersed in Geralt's shoes and the choices you make define his fate and the fate of people around him. Everything comes together and ties with one another.....everything matters, from choosing the additional non critical dialogue for curiosity to later find out that it sounded cocky which results in the Elder Vampire killing you in an instant to the point of choosing what to wear for a formal party. The amount of detail and effort put into these minor things are just unfathomable.\\n\\nFew cons to be nit picky about would be the fast travelling *super irritating to run to every sign post*, a 6 foot drop will instantly kill Geralt, unable to parkour over small obstacles while in combat get frustrating, maintaining item durability is a pain, shopkeeper dialogue options get super repetitive and need to be seen every time, wonky Roach and finally wraiths...they're super annoying (not really a con but I like to mention it and also cause am running out of cons). Yeah thats about all I could pick at. \\n\\nAnyways, if you are wondering to whether or not to play Witcher 3, I'd say stop overthinking and buy it off. Its worth every penny. I highly recommend it to RPG lovers and for the newbies too, some things might be overwhelming at start, but just bare through the first 1-2 hours as you get used to the gameplay. Believe me...not a game to miss.\\n\\nP.S. - For those loyal Witcher lovers out there, who played the entire series, you know....deep down, you know Triss is the better option.\",\n",

       " 'The definition of \"MASTERPIECE\" was made for this game!',\n",
       " \"Words can simply not describe how much I love this game, but will certainly do my best:\\n\\nCharacters - Existing characters such as Geralt, Triss, Ciri, Dandelion, Yen, Keira (plus Shani and Regis for the expansions) have been utilized brilliantly from the source material and used so well in the world the game has created, and boy what a world it is! The characters I previously mentioned are probably the ones that stood out for me the most, but to be honest there are so many brilliantly constructed characters (even minor ones like Bart the Rock Troll) that I simply don't know where to even begin... Geralt's interaction with most them is simply brilliant, and the game has so many amazing, memorable moments because of it (including the famous 'drinking game segment' at Kaer Morgen). You also get a logged back story for each character, most of it taken from the books and/or previous games. which is brilliant if, like me, you decided to read the books afterwards or couldn't be bothered playing through the first couple of Witcher games (although I did get through 3 stages of the original game). It's obviously more important to have this as there is alot of stuff in the game that needs back story to elaborate on, weither it be a situation or certain dialogue. Oh yes the dialogue, love love love some of conversations in this game. You can tell alot of thought and effort went into it. The character dialogue for the most part, particularly for Geralt is so complex and funny. As it is with certain other characters mind you, but Geralt's obviously stands out the most\\n\\nEnvironment - The graphics and art design for all the environments are simply brilliant, each location had its own distinctive feel and is and absolute joy to explore (I spent about 2 weeks just exploring Skellege's oceans and vast landscapes)\\n\\nMonsters/Enemies - Such a huge assorted variety, honestly you can never get bored with the variety of enemies you face. I also love that each monster has it's own unique methods of quickly being dispelled, and everytime you discover something a description will pop up in the beast log, breaking up everything into different categories aswell\\n\\nStory - Soooo gooood. Honestly story elements wise, I don't think any game is going to even come remotely close. Especially given that so many of the side stories actually match, and even sometimes exceed, the complexity and epicness of the main storyline\\n\\nCombat - Kept interesting through the graphic, stylized fighting and dismemberment. Aswell as the additional use of things like signs and potions. Once again you usually need to use certain combinations of things to kill my monsters more easily, particularly the more defined 'boss level' ones\\n\\nExpansions - BRILLIANT. Hearts of Stone has truely amazing story and character elements. While Blood and Wine does this on a slightly lower scale but adds another beautiful environment with various new enemies to face\\n\\nSo basically this the best I can do to some up how epic The Witcher 3 is. But honestly, just play the damn game!!!\\n\\nMy Rating for this game - 10/10\",\n",
       " 'Imagine you\\'re working in a 9-5 corporate job, you\\'re done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you\\'re never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar. While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn\\'t the games, its you. \"Its not that games aren\\'t fun anymore, you have gotten older\".\\n\\nAnd then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can\\'t wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist\\' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....\"Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?\" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who\\'s dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven\\'t felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that\\'s shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?\\n\\nAnd I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feeling I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven\\'t scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the \"Witcher 3 TV show\". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven\\'t done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That\\'s how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.\\n\\nThank you CD Projekt Red. You guys are a gem. I know its 5 years late and I don\\'t know why it took me 5 years to play this, but better late than never.',\n",
       " \"I don't know how to describe this experience. My steam adventure started with The Witcher: Enhanced Edition game, which allowed me to open a steam account. As a console player, I didn't think I would be a computer player, but the witcher series also made me love computer controls.Also, i played the first two games with computer controls, it was fun, but witcher 3 was a game that made me buy a gamepad.The first two games really felt like I was in the game with their open worlds and quality stories. You know, there are some special games that you feel empty when finished. I guess that's how I feel right now. I tried to explore every part of the world and do side quests as much as I could, but I still couldn't get enough of it. This game is a masterpiece for me as an open world and story. There are missions that balance the border between funny and seriousness very well. It is a game that I started late but never tired of playing. I guess it's like a game series that I will play again and again after a certain time. At least it's worth seeing Geralt again ^^\",\n",
       " 'if I had to choose one game to play for all eternity, this would be my instant and definite choice. there is no better rpg out there than this. (in my opinion)',\n",
       " 'What is the premise of life and how is it intertwined with destiny? Some believe that their existence is to perform grand deeds, whilst others contentedly was little girls in basins, an occupation that I earnestly desire. Geralt was one of these men who had a destiny, a goal to slaughter the mentally handicapped, whilst venturing off to pollinate with their caregivers. His aim and dedication in slaughtering the mentally deficient earnt him the ire of various human rights committees who dubbed him the White Wolf, a name inspired by his peculiar habits of skinning his prey alive, to then don them as a cloak. Geralt’s work was so effective that many, from a petulant child, to a mother, fatigued with cleaning out her handicapped child’s waste, and having to spoon fed him intangible jellies as sustenance, frequently contracted the White Wolf to slaughter whatever mouth drivelling, rabid imbecile was assigned. Often the contractors that hired Geralt to slaughter the handicapped were families, or a fuming neighbour, disgruntled over being nightly woken by a mentally handicapped banshee, slamming together two frying pans at the stroke of midnight, whilst serenading an incoherent, intelligible tune. On other occasions he was assigned high profile contracts, most prominently of them all, was the bellower of Castle Whistlewood, a contract he was issues by an individual who wishes to remain anonymous. \\n\\nThe bellower of Castle Whislewood, otherwise regarded as Steven Dawson, was a distant relative of Austin Powers and was generally emotionally volatile, mentally decrepit simpleton with Tourette’s and Autism. Frequently the belower would trail after woman and utter guttural howls, coupled in with vehement obscenities such as “Hello Baby” and “Ding Dong”. All Geralt would have to do is attach an inflatable female doll, scantily clad and with a seductive pose, to a cliff face. In theory, the imbecile, observing such a hedonistic toy would wholeheartedly believe that the woman was genuine and as such would rush towards her, tripping along the way and plummeting to his demise. Unfortunately, this was not a typical case. Steven Dawson was the governing monarch of Castle Whistlewood, an enclosed building, barred away from civilisaiton and comprised of solely him and his thralls. His thralls in question were regarded as the NDSP, the National Disability Support Partners and were sworn to defend him to their dying day. This task would be relatively difficult to complete, as the bellower bore an army at his disposal, one that could call for security and otherwise repel an ill prepared assault if need be. Aware of such a fact, Geralt began to psychologically and mentally prepare. To ward of the evil spirits, he clad himself and his blades in the finest baby oils that Poland had to offer. Then he acquired a mallet to crack open the bellowers skull. Alongside the weapon, four shrapnel grenades were concocted, in the event that Geralt would be required to clear out a throng of adversaries. During preparation, Geralt simultaneously observed national disability adverts, as they left him with an inexplicable rage. After his preparation was complete, Geralt consumed a vial of LSD, bearing tinges of methamphetamine and wade his way into the castle. The initial threat that Geralt encountered was at the hands of a busty, smirking and chipper female, who was situated at the front desk. The female, upon sighting Geralt, began grinning manically, exclaiming, “Hi there, my name is Caroline, how may I help you today?” Geralt, could not believe it, this female was attempting to seduce him, he could envision it plain in her eyes, her desire to bear his offspring was ever present. Fortunately, prior to entering the facility he had warded himself from all incantations and trickery and as such saw through her ploy. The female, sensing Geralts reluctance to answer, jubilantly stated, “Hi there, are you aware that this you are in the disability support partners facility?” These words, thank the dear heavens, were the last that she ever uttered, as Geralt, desiring to elude being captivated by the seductress, hurled a shrapnel grenade at her head, likely slaughtering her instantly. Then, withdrawing a sword and raising aloft a Polish flag, he began his ascent into the hagravens fortress that Steven Dawson called home. \\n\\nMany of the harlots were slaughtered before Geralt encountered his prey. The man, Steven Dawson, was in the midst of serenading to a photograph of a blonde female. The ballad appeared self improvise, as it bore numerous raunchy lyrics and his personal depraved sexual fantasies. Geralt, being unable to endure the sirens wail for a moment more, crept up behind the bellower and promptly caved in his skull with the matter, whilst piercing his chest with a blade. Thus, the contract of the bellower was completed, with Geralt returning to his contractor with the head as evidence of the deed. Afterwards, Geralt’s reputation in the eyes of the world irrevocably altered. Many perceived him as a hero, shielding civilization from the handicapped, whilst more insidious, clandestine groups, such as the NDSP and the UNESCO vilified Geralt, condemning him on his history of virtuous acts. As such, in completing this contract, Geralt had invoked the rage of various sinister groups. Frequently, Geralt throughout roaming in various realms, such as Temeria, Novigrad and the sort was hounded by priests sent by the Catholic Church, security forces, spokespersons for the United Nations and most mobs of depraved fiends who preached about human rights. In typical Geralt fashion he slaughtered them all, whilst locating their families to seduce and copulate with.\\n\\nOverall, I appreciate the plot of the Witcher 3 and have immensely enjoyed slaughtering those who are inept at tying their own shoelaces, let along being able to cognitively contemplate. Furthermore, I appreciate the games symbolism by masquerading the handicapped as fearsome abominations, bearing horns, leathery skin, bristling aggression and solely conversing in guttural howls, as it wholly depicts the fact that the handicapped are not genuinely human, but are merely abominations that perpetually teeter along the edge of insanity. In summary, Witcher 3 is a grand game and I endear all onlookers to engage upon it immediately, lest you wish to never engage in your deep rooted, primalistic desires to assault the disabled.

(this is excluding the main quest) and skellige isles, my god, i have finished 150 hours on steam and am yet to explore the question marks of that area. on top of this, get the dlc, another new area for you to explore with an additional 50 hours of gameplay, bigger than most standalone titles. \\nwitcher 3 is a game which basically tells players to do whatever the hell you want to do and do it at your own pace. no damn thing will force you to go meet this guy or go help this dude find his sheep or goat or whatever. just enjoy the spectacular environs and the mise en scene while you trot around on roach. \\n\\napart from the exploration and side quests, the skill tree provides with multiple options. if youre the kind of player who likes to use signs in combat, well...invest in the blue sign tree. if you are a player who loves to strategize with potions and oils and bombs, focus on the green alchemy tree, or if you want to be a mindless killing machine go forth with the red combat tree with some alchemy skills here and there. you can even unlock a new mutation system in the blood and wine dlc which makes geralt even more stronger. (choose euphoria, its op). and if you think sword play is getting mundane, well then go to the runewright in the hearts of stone dlc and add some badass customizations to your armour and swords. theres just too much content in witcher 3 and if you dedicatedly immerse yourself in the world, doing every side quest, reading every book/bestiary entry/character info and playing every gwent game (fuck i didnt mention gwent, just the most chillest past time of all, don't ignore it) exploring every question mark and finding all treasures, you'll probably find yourself dreaming of playing witcher 4 but......sadly reality strikes and you get depressed knowing that this was the final addition to the series. \\n\\nthe world's immersion is just exquisite, the npcs will change their behaviour based on the choices you make. the people react differently and constantly send remarks, making you realise that witchers are like lepers, not welcomed and shunned by everyone. the sheer amount of emotions which you come across are just so well created, you hate some characters (bloody baron) but then you realise that they might be the lesser evil out of the rest which allows you to draw a conclusion. you are completely immersed in geralt's shoes and the choices you make define his fate and the fate of people around him. everything comes together and ties with one another.....everything matters, from choosing the additional non critical dialogue for curiosity to later find out that it sounded cocky which results in the elder vampire killing you in an instant to the point of choosing what to wear for a formal party. the amount of detail and effort put into these minor things are just unfathomable.\\n\\nfew cons to be nit picky about would be the fast travelling *super irritating to run to every sign post*, a 6 foot drop will instantly kill geralt, unable to parkour over small obstacles while in combat get frustrating, maintaining item durability is a pain, shopkeeper dialogue options get super repetitive and need to be seen every time, wonky roach and finally wraiths...they're super annoying (not really a con but i like to mention it and also cause am running out of cons). yeah thats about all i could pick at. \\n\\nanyways, if you are wondering to whether or not to play witcher 3, i'd say stop overthinking and buy it off. its worth every penny. i highly recommend it to rpg lovers and for the newbies too, some things might be overwhelming at start, but just bare through the first 1-2 hours as you get used to the gameplay. believe me...not a game to miss.\\n\\np.s. - for those loyal witcher lovers out there, who played the entire series, you know....deep down, you know triss is the better option.\""

       "   'review': \"This is my 4th playthrough of Witcher 3, played it thrice on GOG. You can already see where I am going with this review. \\nSprint! YES FINALLY! (DA:Inquisition still doesn't have it). Drink a werewolf decoction and run like the wind. Exploration is taken to another pedestal in Witcher 3. You can basically ditch your adopted daughter and explore the entire Kaer Morhen area in the first 15 mins of the game (provided you skipped the long ass cut-scene in the start). Not interested in fighting the Griffin ? No problem, go ahead and do the pan quest or the other beautifully written side quests in White Orchard or if you get easily intrigued, explore the questions marks on the map. These smart sneakily designed question marks encourage exploration and if you get bored of enjoying the sprint mechanic, call for Roach! Although that dumb broken horse gets annoying after a while. But...that's not it! White Orchard is just the first big  area you are introduced to after Kaer Morhen. Novigrad and Velen together will keep you busy for another 30 hours. (This is excluding the main quest) And Skellige Isles, my god, I have finished 150 hours on steam and am yet to explore the question marks of that area. On top of this, get the DLC, another new area for you to explore with an additional 50 hours of gameplay, bigger than most standalone titles. \\nWitcher 3 is a game which basically tells players to do whatever the hell you want to do and do it at your own pace. No damn thing will force you to go meet this guy or go help this dude find his sheep or goat or whatever. Just enjoy the spectacular environs and the mise en scene while you trot around on Roach. \\n\\nApart from the exploration and side quests, the skill tree provides with multiple options. If youre the kind of player who likes to use signs in combat, well...invest in the blue sign tree. If you are a player who loves to strategize with potions and oils and bombs, focus on the green alchemy tree, or if you want to be a mindless killing machine go forth with the red combat tree with some alchemy skills here and there. You can even unlock a new mutation system in the Blood and Wine DLC which makes Geralt even more stronger. (Choose Euphoria, its OP). And if you think sword play is getting mundane, well then go to the Runewright in the Hearts of Stone DLC and add some badass customizations to your armour and swords. Theres just too much content in Witcher 3 and if you dedicatedly immerse yourself in the world, doing every side quest, reading every book/bestiary entry/character info and playing every Gwent Game (fuck I didnt mention Gwent, just the most chillest past time of all, don't ignore it) exploring every question mark and finding all treasures, you'll probably find yourself dreaming of playing Witcher 4 but......sadly reality strikes and you get depressed knowing that this was the final addition to the series. \\n\\nThe world's immersion is just exquisite, the NPCs will change their behaviour based on the choices you make. The people react differently and constantly send remarks, making you realise that Witchers are like lepers, not welcomed and shunned by everyone. The sheer amount of emotions which you come across are just so well created, you hate some characters (bloody baron) but then you realise that they might be the lesser evil out of the rest which allows you to draw a conclusion. You are completely immersed in Geralt's shoes and the choices you make define his fate and the fate of people around him. Everything comes together and ties with one another.....everything matters, from choosing the additional non critical dialogue for curiosity to later find out that it sounded cocky which results in the Elder Vampire killing you in an instant to the point of choosing what to wear for a formal party. The amount of detail and effort put into these minor things are just unfathomable.\\n\\nFew cons to be nit picky about would be the fast travelling *super irritating to run to every sign post*, a 6 foot drop will instantly kill Geralt, unable to parkour over small obstacles while in combat get frustrating, maintaining item durability is a pain, shopkeeper dialogue options get super repetitive and need to be seen every time, wonky Roach and finally wraiths...they're super annoying (not really a con but I like to mention it and also cause am running out of cons). Yeah thats about all I could pick at. \\n\\nAnyways, if you are wondering to whether or not to play Witcher 3, I'd say stop overthinking and buy it off. Its worth every penny. I highly recommend it to RPG lovers and for the newbies too, some things might be overwhelming at start, but just bare through the first 1-2 hours as you get used to the gameplay. Believe me...not a game to miss.\\n\\nP.S. - For those loyal Witcher lovers out there, who played the entire series, you know....deep down, you know Triss is the better option.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Words can simply not describe how much I love this game, but will certainly do my best:\\n\\nCharacters - Existing characters such as Geralt, Triss, Ciri, Dandelion, Yen, Keira (plus Shani and Regis for the expansions) have been utilized brilliantly from the source material and used so well in the world the game has created, and boy what a world it is! The characters I previously mentioned are probably the ones that stood out for me the most, but to be honest there are so many brilliantly constructed characters (even minor ones like Bart the Rock Troll) that I simply don't know where to even begin... Geralt's interaction with most them is simply brilliant, and the game has so many amazing, memorable moments because of it (including the famous 'drinking game segment' at Kaer Morgen). You also get a logged back story for each character, most of it taken from the books and/or previous games. which is brilliant if, like me, you decided to read the books afterwards or couldn't be bothered playing through the first couple of Witcher games (although I did get through 3 stages of the original game). It's obviously more important to have this as there is alot of stuff in the game that needs back story to elaborate on, weither it be a situation or certain dialogue. Oh yes the dialogue, love love love some of conversations in this game. You can tell alot of thought and effort went into it. The character dialogue for the most part, particularly for Geralt is so complex and funny. As it is with certain other characters mind you, but Geralt's obviously stands out the most\\n\\nEnvironment - The graphics and art design for all the environments are simply brilliant, each location had its own distinctive feel and is and absolute joy to explore (I spent about 2 weeks just exploring Skellege's oceans and vast landscapes)\\n\\nMonsters/Enemies - Such a huge assorted variety, honestly you can never get bored with the variety of enemies you face. I also love that each monster has it's own unique methods of quickly being dispelled, and everytime you discover something a description will pop up in the beast log, breaking up everything into different categories aswell\\n\\nStory - Soooo gooood. Honestly story elements wise, I don't think any game is going to even come remotely close. Especially given that so many of the side stories actually match, and even sometimes exceed, the complexity and epicness of the main storyline\\n\\nCombat - Kept interesting through the graphic, stylized fighting and dismemberment. Aswell as the additional use of things like signs and potions. Once again you usually need to use certain combinations of things to kill my monsters more easily, particularly the more defined 'boss level' ones\\n\\nExpansions - BRILLIANT. Hearts of Stone has truely amazing story and character elements. While Blood and Wine does this on a slightly lower scale but adds another beautiful environment with various new enemies to face\\n\\nSo basically this the best I can do to some up how epic The Witcher 3 is. But honestly, just play the damn game!!!\\n\\nMy Rating for this game - 10/10\",\n",

       "   'review': 'Imagine you\\'re working in a 9-5 corporate job, you\\'re done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you\\'re never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar. While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn\\'t the games, its you. \"Its not that games aren\\'t fun anymore, you have gotten older\".\\n\\nAnd then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can\\'t wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist\\' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....\"Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?\" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who\\'s dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven\\'t felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that\\'s shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?\\n\\nAnd I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feeling I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven\\'t scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the \"Witcher 3 TV show\". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven\\'t done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That\\'s how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.\\n\\nThank you CD Projekt Red. You guys are a gem. I know its 5 years late and I don\\'t know why it took me 5 years to play this, but better late than never.',\n",

       "   'review': \"I don't know how to describe this experience. My steam adventure started with The Witcher: Enhanced Edition game, which allowed me to open a steam account. As a console player, I didn't think I would be a computer player, but the witcher series also made me love computer controls.Also, i played the first two games with computer controls, it was fun, but witcher 3 was a game that made me buy a gamepad.The first two games really felt like I was in the game with their open worlds and quality stories. You know, there are some special games that you feel empty when finished. I guess that's how I feel right now. I tried to explore every part of the world and do side quests as much as I could, but I still couldn't get enough of it. This game is a masterpiece for me as an open world and story. There are missions that balance the border between funny and seriousness very well. It is a game that I started late but never tired of playing. I guess it's like a game series that I will play again and again after a certain time. At least it's worth seeing Geralt again ^^\",\n",

       "   'review': 'What is the premise of life and how is it intertwined with destiny? Some believe that their existence is to perform grand deeds, whilst others contentedly was little girls in basins, an occupation that I earnestly desire. Geralt was one of these men who had a destiny, a goal to slaughter the mentally handicapped, whilst venturing off to pollinate with their caregivers. His aim and dedication in slaughtering the mentally deficient earnt him the ire of various human rights committees who dubbed him the White Wolf, a name inspired by his peculiar habits of skinning his prey alive, to then don them as a cloak. Geralt’s work was so effective that many, from a petulant child, to a mother, fatigued with cleaning out her handicapped child’s waste, and having to spoon fed him intangible jellies as sustenance, frequently contracted the White Wolf to slaughter whatever mouth drivelling, rabid imbecile was assigned. Often the contractors that hired Geralt to slaughter the handicapped were families, or a fuming neighbour, disgruntled over being nightly woken by a mentally handicapped banshee, slamming together two frying pans at the stroke of midnight, whilst serenading an incoherent, intelligible tune. On other occasions he was assigned high profile contracts, most prominently of them all, was the bellower of Castle Whistlewood, a contract he was issues by an individual who wishes to remain anonymous. \\n\\nThe bellower of Castle Whislewood, otherwise regarded as Steven Dawson, was a distant relative of Austin Powers and was generally emotionally volatile, mentally decrepit simpleton with Tourette’s and Autism. Frequently the belower would trail after woman and utter guttural howls, coupled in with vehement obscenities such as “Hello Baby” and “Ding Dong”. All Geralt would have to do is attach an inflatable female doll, scantily clad and with a seductive pose, to a cliff face. In theory, the imbecile, observing such a hedonistic toy would wholeheartedly believe that the woman was genuine and as such would rush towards her, tripping along the way and plummeting to his demise. Unfortunately, this was not a typical case. Steven Dawson was the governing monarch of Castle Whistlewood, an enclosed building, barred away from civilisaiton and comprised of solely him and his thralls. His thralls in question were regarded as the NDSP, the National Disability Support Partners and were sworn to defend him to their dying day. This task would be relatively difficult to complete, as the bellower bore an army at his disposal, one that could call for security and otherwise repel an ill prepared assault if need be. Aware of such a fact, Geralt began to psychologically and mentally prepare. To ward of the evil spirits, he clad himself and his blades in the finest baby oils that Poland had to offer. Then he acquired a mallet to crack open the bellowers skull. Alongside the weapon, four shrapnel grenades were concocted, in the event that Geralt would be required to clear out a throng of adversaries. During preparation, Geralt simultaneously observed national disability adverts, as they left him with an inexplicable rage. After his preparation was complete, Geralt consumed a vial of LSD, bearing tinges of methamphetamine and wade his way into the castle. The initial threat that Geralt encountered was at the hands of a busty, smirking and chipper female, who was situated at the front desk. The female, upon sighting Geralt, began grinning manically, exclaiming, “Hi there, my name is Caroline, how may I help you today?” Geralt, could not believe it, this female was attempting to seduce him, he could envision it plain in her eyes, her desire to bear his offspring was ever present. Fortunately, prior to entering the facility he had warded himself from all incantations and trickery and as such saw through her ploy. The female, sensing Geralts reluctance to answer, jubilantly stated, “Hi there, are you aware that this you are in the disability support partners facility?” These words, thank the dear heavens, were the last that she ever uttered, as Geralt, desiring to elude being captivated by the seductress, hurled a shrapnel grenade at her head, likely slaughtering her instantly. Then, withdrawing a sword and raising aloft a Polish flag, he began his ascent into the hagravens fortress that Steven Dawson called home. \\n\\nMany of the harlots were slaughtered before Geralt encountered his prey. The man, Steven Dawson, was in the midst of serenading to a photograph of a blonde female. The ballad appeared self improvise, as it bore numerous raunchy lyrics and his personal depraved sexual fantasies. Geralt, being unable to endure the sirens wail for a moment more, crept up behind the bellower and promptly caved in his skull with the matter, whilst piercing his chest with a blade. Thus, the contract of the bellower was completed, with Geralt returning to his contractor with the head as evidence of the deed. Afterwards, Geralt’s reputation in the eyes of the world irrevocably altered. Many perceived him as a hero, shielding civilization from the handicapped, whilst more insidious, clandestine groups, such as the NDSP and the UNESCO vilified Geralt, condemning him on his history of virtuous acts. As such, in completing this contract, Geralt had invoked the rage of various sinister groups. Frequently, Geralt throughout roaming in various realms, such as Temeria, Novigrad and the sort was hounded by priests sent by the Catholic Church, security forces, spokespersons for the United Nations and most mobs of depraved fiends who preached about human rights. In typical Geralt fashion he slaughtered them all, whilst locating their families to seduce and copulate with.\\n\\nOverall, I appreciate the plot of the Witcher 3 and have immensely enjoyed slaughtering those who are inept at tying their own shoelaces, let along being able to cognitively contemplate. Furthermore, I appreciate the games symbolism by masquerading the handicapped as fearsome abominations, bearing horns, leathery skin, bristling aggression and solely conversing in guttural howls, as it wholly depicts the fact that the handicapped are not genuinely human, but are merely abominations that perpetually teeter along the edge of insanity. In summary, Witcher 3 is a grand game and I endear all onlookers to engage upon it immediately, lest you wish to never engage in your deep rooted, primalistic desires to assault the disabled. Oy Lazare, Lazare. Tuka nis a kazali. Kolko liste po gorrach, tolko zdrave na taz kyshcha. Tervo tuka doydome, Moma momche naydome. Ya momata godete. Ya momcheto zhenete.',\n",

       " 'In my top 3 games of all time.\\nAlso in an effort to save some unfortunate soul from my mistake, I must warn you....if you mod this game and get the Fast Travel from anywhere mod, you can completely break this game and lock yourself out from being able to complete main quests.\\nDO NOT USE THE FAST TRAVEL MOD!\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/4ho4le/broke_witcher_3_w_fast_travel_mod_looking_for/',\n",
       " \"This is my 4th playthrough of Witcher 3, played it thrice on GOG. You can already see where I am going with this review. \\nSprint! YES FINALLY! (DA:Inquisition still doesn't have it). Drink a werewolf decoction and run like the wind. Exploration is taken to another pedestal in Witcher 3. You can basically ditch your adopted daughter and explore the entire Kaer Morhen area in the first 15 mins of the game (provided you skipped the long ass cut-scene in the start). Not interested in fighting the Griffin ? No problem, go ahead and do the pan quest or the other beautifully written side quests in White Orchard or if you get easily intrigued, explore the questions marks on the map. These smart sneakily designed question marks encourage exploration and if you get bored of enjoying the sprint mechanic, call for Roach! Although that dumb broken horse gets annoying after a while. But...that's not it! White Orchard is just the first big  area you are introduced to after Kaer Morhen. Novigrad and Velen together will keep you busy for another 30 hours. (This is excluding the main quest) And Skellige Isles, my god, I have finished 150 hours on steam and am yet to explore the question marks of that area. On top of this, get the DLC, another new area for you to explore with an additional 50 hours of gameplay, bigger than most standalone titles. \\nWitcher 3 is a game which basically tells players to do whatever the hell you want to do and do it at your own pace. No damn thing will force you to go meet this guy or go help this dude find his sheep or goat or whatever. Just enjoy the spectacular environs and the mise en scene while you trot around on Roach. \\n\\nApart from the exploration and side quests, the skill tree provides with multiple options. If youre the kind of player who likes to use signs in combat, well...invest in the blue sign tree. If you are a player who loves to strategize with potions and oils and bombs, focus on the green alchemy tree, or if you want to be a mindless killing machine go forth with the red combat tree with some alchemy skills here and there. You can even unlock a new mutation system in the Blood and Wine DLC which makes Geralt even more stronger. (Choose Euphoria, its OP). And if you think sword play is getting mundane, well then go to the Runewright in the Hearts of Stone DLC and add some badass customizations to your armour and swords. Theres just too much content in Witcher 3 and if you dedicatedly immerse yourself in the world, doing every side quest, reading every book/bestiary entry/character info and playing every Gwent Game (fuck I didnt mention Gwent, just the most chillest past time of all, don't ignore it) exploring every question mark and finding all treasures, you'll probably find yourself dreaming of playing Witcher 4 but......sadly reality strikes and you get depressed knowing that this was the final addition to the series. \\n\\nThe world's immersion is just exquisite, the NPCs will change their behaviour based on the choices you make. The people react differently and constantly send remarks, making you realise that Witchers are like lepers, not welcomed and shunned by everyone. The sheer amount of emotions which you come across are just so well created, you hate some characters (bloody baron) but then you realise that they might be the lesser evil out of the rest which allows you to draw a conclusion. You are completely immersed in Geralt's shoes and the choices you make define his fate and the fate of people around him. Everything comes together and ties with one another.....everything matters, from choosing the additional non critical dialogue for curiosity to later find out that it sounded cocky which results in the Elder Vampire killing you in an instant to the point of choosing what to wear for a formal party. The amount of detail and effort put into these minor things are just unfathomable.\\n\\nFew cons to be nit picky about would be the fast travelling *super irritating to run to every sign post*, a 6 foot drop will instantly kill Geralt, unable to parkour over small obstacles while in combat get frustrating, maintaining item durability is a pain, shopkeeper dialogue options get super repetitive and need to be seen every time, wonky Roach and finally wraiths...they're super annoying (not really a con but I like to mention it and also cause am running out of cons). Yeah thats about all I could pick at. \\n\\nAnyways, if you are wondering to whether or not to play Witcher 3, I'd say stop overthinking and buy it off. Its worth every penny. I highly recommend it to RPG lovers and for the newbies too, some things might be overwhelming at start, but just bare through the first 1-2 hours as you get used to the gameplay. Believe me...not a game to miss.\\n\\nP.S. - For those loyal Witcher lovers out there, who played the entire series, you know....deep down, you know Triss is the better option.\",\n",

       " 'The definition of \"MASTERPIECE\" was made for this game!',\n",
       " \"Words can simply not describe how much I love this game, but will certainly do my best:\\n\\nCharacters - Existing characters such as Geralt, Triss, Ciri, Dandelion, Yen, Keira (plus Shani and Regis for the expansions) have been utilized brilliantly from the source material and used so well in the world the game has created, and boy what a world it is! The characters I previously mentioned are probably the ones that stood out for me the most, but to be honest there are so many brilliantly constructed characters (even minor ones like Bart the Rock Troll) that I simply don't know where to even begin... Geralt's interaction with most them is simply brilliant, and the game has so many amazing, memorable moments because of it (including the famous 'drinking game segment' at Kaer Morgen). You also get a logged back story for each character, most of it taken from the books and/or previous games. which is brilliant if, like me, you decided to read the books afterwards or couldn't be bothered playing through the first couple of Witcher games (although I did get through 3 stages of the original game). It's obviously more important to have this as there is alot of stuff in the game that needs back story to elaborate on, weither it be a situation or certain dialogue. Oh yes the dialogue, love love love some of conversations in this game. You can tell alot of thought and effort went into it. The character dialogue for the most part, particularly for Geralt is so complex and funny. As it is with certain other characters mind you, but Geralt's obviously stands out the most\\n\\nEnvironment - The graphics and art design for all the environments are simply brilliant, each location had its own distinctive feel and is and absolute joy to explore (I spent about 2 weeks just exploring Skellege's oceans and vast landscapes)\\n\\nMonsters/Enemies - Such a huge assorted variety, honestly you can never get bored with the variety of enemies you face. I also love that each monster has it's own unique methods of quickly being dispelled, and everytime you discover something a description will pop up in the beast log, breaking up everything into different categories aswell\\n\\nStory - Soooo gooood. Honestly story elements wise, I don't think any game is going to even come remotely close. Especially given that so many of the side stories actually match, and even sometimes exceed, the complexity and epicness of the main storyline\\n\\nCombat - Kept interesting through the graphic, stylized fighting and dismemberment. Aswell as the additional use of things like signs and potions. Once again you usually need to use certain combinations of things to kill my monsters more easily, particularly the more defined 'boss level' ones\\n\\nExpansions - BRILLIANT. Hearts of Stone has truely amazing story and character elements. While Blood and Wine does this on a slightly lower scale but adds another beautiful environment with various new enemies to face\\n\\nSo basically this the best I can do to some up how epic The Witcher 3 is. But honestly, just play the damn game!!!\\n\\nMy Rating for this game - 10/10\",\n",
       " 'Imagine you\\'re working in a 9-5 corporate job, you\\'re done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you\\'re never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar. While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn\\'t the games, its you. \"Its not that games aren\\'t fun anymore, you have gotten older\".\\n\\nAnd then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can\\'t wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist\\' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....\"Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?\" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who\\'s dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven\\'t felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that\\'s shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?\\n\\nAnd I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feeling I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven\\'t scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the \"Witcher 3 TV show\". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven\\'t done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That\\'s how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.\\n\\nThank you CD Projekt Red. You guys are a gem. I know its 5 years late and I don\\'t know why it took me 5 years to play this, but better late than never.',\n",

       " \"I don't know how to describe this experience. My steam adventure started with The Witcher: Enhanced Edition game, which allowed me to open a steam account. As a console player, I didn't think I would be a computer player, but the witcher series also made me love computer controls.Also, i played the first two games with computer controls, it was fun, but witcher 3 was a game that made me buy a gamepad.The first two games really felt like I was in the game with their open worlds and quality stories. You know, there are some special games that you feel empty when finished. I guess that's how I feel right now. I tried to explore every part of the world and do side quests as much as I could, but I still couldn't get enough of it. This game is a masterpiece for me as an open world and story. There are missions that balance the border between funny and seriousness very well. It is a game that I started late but never tired of playing. I guess it's like a game series that I will play again and again after a certain time. At least it's worth seeing Geralt again ^^\",\n",
       " 'What is the premise of life and how is it intertwined with destiny? Some believe that their existence is to perform grand deeds, whilst others contentedly was little girls in basins, an occupation that I earnestly desire. Geralt was one of these men who had a destiny, a goal to slaughter the mentally handicapped, whilst venturing off to pollinate with their caregivers. His aim and dedication in slaughtering the mentally deficient earnt him the ire of various human rights committees who dubbed him the White Wolf, a name inspired by his peculiar habits of skinning his prey alive, to then don them as a cloak. Geralt’s work was so effective that many, from a petulant child, to a mother, fatigued with cleaning out her handicapped child’s waste, and having to spoon fed him intangible jellies as sustenance, frequently contracted the White Wolf to slaughter whatever mouth drivelling, rabid imbecile was assigned. Often the contractors that hired Geralt to slaughter the handicapped were families, or a fuming neighbour, disgruntled over being nightly woken by a mentally handicapped banshee, slamming together two frying pans at the stroke of midnight, whilst serenading an incoherent, intelligible tune. On other occasions he was assigned high profile contracts, most prominently of them all, was the bellower of Castle Whistlewood, a contract he was issues by an individual who wishes to remain anonymous. \\n\\nThe bellower of Castle Whislewood, otherwise regarded as Steven Dawson, was a distant relative of Austin Powers and was generally emotionally volatile, mentally decrepit simpleton with Tourette’s and Autism. Frequently the belower would trail after woman and utter guttural howls, coupled in with vehement obscenities such as “Hello Baby” and “Ding Dong”. All Geralt would have to do is attach an inflatable female doll, scantily clad and with a seductive pose, to a cliff face. In theory, the imbecile, observing such a hedonistic toy would wholeheartedly believe that the woman was genuine and as such would rush towards her, tripping along the way and plummeting to his demise. Unfortunately, this was not a typical case. Steven Dawson was the governing monarch of Castle Whistlewood, an enclosed building, barred away from civilisaiton and comprised of solely him and his thralls. His thralls in question were regarded as the NDSP, the National Disability Support Partners and were sworn to defend him to their dying day. This task would be relatively difficult to complete, as the bellower bore an army at his disposal, one that could call for security and otherwise repel an ill prepared assault if need be. Aware of such a fact, Geralt began to psychologically and mentally prepare. To ward of the evil spirits, he clad himself and his blades in the finest baby oils that Poland had to offer. Then he acquired a mallet to crack open the bellowers skull. Alongside the weapon, four shrapnel grenades were concocted, in the event that Geralt would be required to clear out a throng of adversaries. During preparation, Geralt simultaneously observed national disability adverts, as they left him with an inexplicable rage. After his preparation was complete, Geralt consumed a vial of LSD, bearing tinges of methamphetamine and wade his way into the castle. The initial threat that Geralt encountered was at the hands of a busty, smirking and chipper female, who was situated at the front desk. The female, upon sighting Geralt, began grinning manically, exclaiming, “Hi there, my name is Caroline, how may I help you today?” Geralt, could not believe it, this female was attempting to seduce him, he could envision it plain in her eyes, her desire to bear his offspring was ever present. Fortunately, prior to entering the facility he had warded himself from all incantations and trickery and as such saw through her ploy. The female, sensing Geralts reluctance to answer, jubilantly stated, “Hi there, are you aware that this you are in the disability support partners facility?” These words, thank the dear heavens, were the last that she ever uttered, as Geralt, desiring to elude being captivated by the seductress, hurled a shrapnel grenade at her head, likely slaughtering her instantly. Then, withdrawing a sword and raising aloft a Polish flag, he began his ascent into the hagravens fortress that Steven Dawson called home. \\n\\nMany of the harlots were slaughtered before Geralt encountered his prey. The man, Steven Dawson, was in the midst of serenading to a photograph of a blonde female. The ballad appeared self improvise, as it bore numerous raunchy lyrics and his personal depraved sexual fantasies. Geralt, being unable to endure the sirens wail for a moment more, crept up behind the bellower and promptly caved in his skull with the matter, whilst piercing his chest with a blade. Thus, the contract of the bellower was completed, with Geralt returning to his contractor with the head as evidence of the deed. Afterwards, Geralt’s reputation in the eyes of the world irrevocably altered. Many perceived him as a hero, shielding civilization from the handicapped, whilst more insidious, clandestine groups, such as the NDSP and the UNESCO vilified Geralt, condemning him on his history of virtuous acts. As such, in completing this contract, Geralt had invoked the rage of various sinister groups. Frequently, Geralt throughout roaming in various realms, such as Temeria, Novigrad and the sort was hounded by priests sent by the Catholic Church, security forces, spokespersons for the United Nations and most mobs of depraved fiends who preached about human rights. In typical Geralt fashion he slaughtered them all, whilst locating their families to seduce and copulate with.\\n\\nOverall, I appreciate the plot of the Witcher 3 and have immensely enjoyed slaughtering those who are inept at tying their own shoelaces, let along being able to cognitively contemplate. Furthermore, I appreciate the games symbolism by masquerading the handicapped as fearsome abominations, bearing horns, leathery skin, bristling aggression and solely conversing in guttural howls, as it wholly depicts the fact that the handicapped are not genuinely human, but are merely abominations that perpetually teeter along the edge of insanity. In summary, Witcher 3 is a grand game and I endear all onlookers to engage upon it immediately, lest you wish to never engage in your deep rooted, primalistic desires to assault the disabled.

       " 'So I played the game for 100 hours so I could get an honest review of it instead of playing it for 5 and saying it is trash or not playing it enough for me to notice it\\'s critique. I will compare this game to other RPG\\'s or similar games. If you want a summary of this review I will write it at the bottom of this review along with the reviews of the DLC\\'s but on to the start. \\n\\nINTRODUCTION: My Fallout Experience (the 1000 word essay) on how this game is great\\n\\nWe have all heard of \"Fallout New Vegas\" and I, as many others have been taught or shown across the internet is that this is the definitive best fallout game. So after some time I decided to get the game with all it\\'s DLC\\'s and decided that I would check out the game and see if all the hype was concrete or was just fallout fans with rose tinted glasses.\\n\\nI start of with installing and starting the game and realizing that it is completely uncompatable with windows 10. This may be on Bethesda\\'s part as I know fallout 3 has this exact issue as well. So my journey begins in the mod manager and .ini files to enable more memory usage. But after these fixes the game only crashed twice throughout my whole 100 hour playthrough. \\n(The mods included in my mod list have no effect on the game but only made it crash less and fix memory usage)\\n\\nSo I start of with an amazing introduction to the main factions and the story taking place in Fallout New Vegas from the get go by a aged but still good cinematic. Comparing it to the Fallout 4 cinematic I would say this one introduces alot more of the world to the player compared to the black and white war scene all about \"war never changes\". I start of the game with making my character. In comparison to other RPG\\'s like Skyrim (or Fallout 4) this game truly gave you the tools to make your own character. Everything from the wacky dialogue options to actual things that could impact your gameplay is decided from what S.P.E.C.I.A.L points, skills and perks you picked. This really made it feel like your decisions mattered from the get go. So I get on my mary way out on to the Majave wasteland and instantly get hit with this massive world to explore but I follow a long the main story and talk to \"Easy Pete\" and get introduced to these amazing dialogue options. Comparing it to other Bethesda games they were truly fleshed out and you could totally make sense of the conversation when you could actually read a sentance that your character would say instead of a few words or \"yes\" and \"no\".\\n\\nAt this point I also get introduced to the Karma system where bad and good actions could impact your late game stats. As I get hit with these intrequet systems that I would say are pretty overwhelming if you don\\'t expect it or are not used to RPG\\'s or other roleplaying games I also discover the grave sight and see a grave. You can dig a grave but only if you have a shovel, so I go to the little ponsy shop in Goodsprings right next to the grave sight and buy a shovel. With this I had made an impact on my  gameplay through my choices and ended up with a laser rifle. A mid game weapon at level 2. When this happened I knew I was gonna have a good time with this game. I made my way and thought I would make my way to the big glowing tower that is the \"Lucky 38\" and boy did I get turned into shreds by those deathclaws. Facing the strongest enemy in the game and it not feeling like a cake walk like in a later released fallout game. It showed me where my place was which was killing powder gangers and thugs after I got my ass beat by every abomination I came across. It set a milestone for me to get through that valley and kill those radscorpions that plagued me when I left goodsprings. The game made me feel like I was in for a journey, a journey that was mine to make and my choices mattered. Here the characters, the voice acting, the effects. They were lasting and they did change the story for my character which made the game so much more enjoyable. \\n\\nAfter my introductions to the game as a whole I got to know the factions in the game a little more and if I were to summarize them I would describe them as such. The Legion are the \"bad guys\" who are misogynistic, dog fucking, twink boy-toy slave owners that base themselves on the ideals of the roman enthusiast Ceasar. Then we have the NCR (New Californian Republic) the \"good guys\" who traveled into New Vegas to help the citizens and by \"help\" they mean help the areas with recources they need.\\n\\nSUMMARY: \\n\\nGAMEPLAY:\\nThe game held up to the expectations I was expecting which was shocking as I went into the game thinking \"this game is the best RPG I have ever played\". But it truly is the best RPG I have ever played and the best RPG on my game list. I love all the elements of this game and how your actions can impact the games surroundings and that your choices matter for the story and in general gameplay.\\n\\nCOMBAT:\\nThe gun play is simple yes, yet satisfying and a lot of perks you learn compliment the experience. Melee is simple and don\\'t involve more complex combat except block and swing but it is satisfying turning a ghoul\\'s head into mash potatoe. \\n\\nSTORY:\\nThe main story has a simple premise but has complex solutions as you can shape the ending of the game however you deem fit which is something truly rare in games these days. Even story telling games don\\'t dwell into your choices mattering this much for the outcome of the story.\\n\\nSOUND/MUSIC:\\nIf you don\\'t turn on the radio in this game you are truly missing out on some bangers I am telling ya, but seriously the sound design in this game is as everything else truly masterful. You will have to explore the vaults and everything else with it\\'s matching soundtrack that either puts shivers down your spine, makes you enticipate what combat scenario is next or makes you jam in out in the lobby halls of the casinos.\\n\\nGRAPHICS:\\nNow this game is 10 years old so I didn\\'t wanna slack on it too hard but even some games that came out the following year looked a lot better than this. But the graphics are not too bad, they are still good especially by 2010 standards and give more of a Fallout feeling to it all. Something about the graphical design of New Vegas just give more of a rustic run down wasteland sort of feeling with its orange tones but that might just be me.\\n\\nDLC\\'S:\\nI really enjoyed 3/4 DLC\\'s which were. Old World Blues, Honest Hearts, Lonesome Road. If you are playing New Vegas these DLC\\'s are a must play in my opinion as they are truly great DLC\\'s. Dead Money on the other hand did not hit home for me as many others. But if you like dialogues with character building and clues of a mystery to solve and puzzles I can see how you would enjoy this DLC as well.\\n\\nARCHITECHTURE:\\nThe buildings just look great, you know what they are supposed to be and in what conditions. You know what buildings stand out and which ones you can enter apart from some instances.\\n\\nTHE BAD:\\nNow there are alot of great things with this game that is for sure, like how great the RPG elements are and so on. But there is a few bad things, like how the game isn\\'t functional from the get go and that you have to manually fix it. There is also the landscape which has some unique parts like red rock canyon and the area around the strip that look notorious and when you are there you know exactly where you are. But a part from those specific places all the other 60~% look the same but that is the only concern I had when playing apart from some bugs and the two instances of crashes.\\n\\n\\nRATING:\\n\\nGraphics:          ☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢         3/5\\nRPG Elements: ☢☢☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢    5/5\\nCombat:           ☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢         3/5\\nGameplay:        ☢☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢     4/5\\nStory:                ☢☢☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢  5/5\\nSound Design:  ☢☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢     4/5\\n(Added Content: ☢☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢   4/5)\\n\\nOverall Score: 4/5\\nShould you play buy it?

       " '[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\\n\\nHades is an excellent game that deserves every bit of praise it receives. Play it. Even if you are not into action roguelikes or Greek mythology, this game is still worth trying out for the sake of an authentic experience.\\n\\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\\n\\nEvery so often, a dedicated and highly talented person or a group of people creates a masterpiece like any other – with their own vision, style, and storytelling. Hades is a game only Supergiant Games could make. It is monumental, both for the roguelike genre and as a video game in general; a must-play for everyone.\\n\\nLet me start from afar. Video games as a medium are a way to escape unpleasant or uneventful everyday life. It is escapism, a necessary psychological device to divert thoughts from sadness, loss, or boredom. You can see it in every type of entertainment humans have, not merely video games. Likewise, roguelikes have deep roots in literal “escape” concerning their narrative (the hero always tries to escape a dungeon or labyrinth of sorts or even their fate). We might call it double escapism. At the same time, stories in most roguelikes only distantly resemble real-life situations. That is where Supergiant makes a difference. They not only create an addictive game with exceptional style and music, but they also tell a deeply allegorical coming-of-age story. You know, the type of story every one of us lives through at some point because there are no ideal families, as well as relationships. Maybe some will not see it like that, of course, but this allegory threads through every aspect of Hades in so many subtle ways! It returns you from the whimsical world (or should I say Underworld?) to your everyday life with new feelings, thoughts, and a desire to sort everything through. That is the highest praise I could imagine for an entertainment medium.\\n\\nHades (the game) follows the story of Zagreus and his relationship with his tyrant father, Hades, the god of the Underworld himself. I love Greek mythology and Ancient Greek literature, and I must admit the level of detail is brilliant. There are many myths from different sources; Supergiant chooses its interpretations very carefully, so the story feels consistent. The central figure of the game, Zagreus, is not as renowned as other mythical gods and heroes. Thus, there was a degree of freedom regarding the main character and his relationships with everyone around. Even there, though, in late interactions with Dionysus, we can learn how the whole “Orphic Dionysus Zagreus” myth came to life through a joke, according to the plot. So, yeah, I mean it when I say the level of detail is brilliant! Zagreus, or Zag for short, is a young godling who wants to escape his dull life in the Underworld, where his father is the Master and the Lord. Hades (the god) demands from his son, whom he scornfully calls “boy,” to be responsible, respectful, and obedient; at the same time, he fails to give the tiniest bit of love. For Zag, there is only one solution: running away to Olympus. One problem, though – no one can escape the Underworld, even a godling! And so we start our desperate journey as Zag, trying to leave the domain of the dead. The story is deep and meaningful; its narration goes through many dialogs with different characters, intertwined between escape attempts into one whole piece. Slowly, the perspective shifts: the initial father-son conflict reveals underlying problems and broader themes. My favorite includes exercising honesty and outspokenness and why it is not always the best course of action in a manifold family to tell everything head-on.\\n\\nGameplay-wise, Hades is as addictive as a perfect roguelike should be. You have to rely on your wit, reaction (sometimes even sense of rhythm), and, of course, luck to fight your way through the ever-changing environment with hundreds of possible adjustments to your strategy and tactics. I could play games like Crypt of the NecroDancer or Dicey Dungeons in short sessions, but Hades? Nope. I play it, and play it, and play it. Again and again. It is so very addictive! Different weapons, boons, power-ups, and their combinations result in some weird and powerful twists to efficient tactics, which is an example of RNG done right. If you die, you can start again a bit stronger (if you gathered enough Darkness, that is) through the process amusingly called Reflecting. Due to its core mechanics, the game can be frustrating, but that only means your character has not been powerful enough to beat something as of yet. Just play some more, and you will naturally overcome the obstacle. It starts to feel repetitive only when you finish the main story. At that point, the only way of raising the challenge is through the Pact of Punishment, a plot device to make your post-story runs harder.\\n\\nAs always with Supergiant, the voice acting and music are exceptional. Beautiful melodies combined with heavier riffs and reverberations suit the style and story greatly. And when Orpheus (Darren Korb, the composer) and Eurydice (Ashley Barrett) start singing, their verses seem to be out of this world. It is not a simple task to assume the roles of the legendary musician and his muse and sing their parts convincingly. Somehow, Darren and Ashley pull it out. I had tears and goosebumps listening to In the Blood after finishing the game! Truly magnificent.\\n\\nLastly, I want to briefly mention the Fated List of Minor Prophecies which adds depth to the choice-making during escape attempts, and the detailed statistics menu for your runs. Little nuances like these contribute to the entire thing, making it much more enjoyable. And, well, there is also fishing. Because why not?',\n",
       " 'Hades is a rougelike game that actually incorporates the concept of \"doing runs over and over\" in a way that makes sense into it\\'s story. You\\'re not just doing this because its a videogame, rather because in the context of the game its an actual mechanic and a \"normal behavior\".\\nIn this game you will likely die in early chambers when you begin, but this is pretty much on par to how the game is designed, as you play more you will not only get better at handling Zagreus and learn enemy patterns, but also collect resources to make future runs easier, as you\\'ll be able to permanently upgrade yourself, making future attempts more likely to succeed.\\nThe main powers you acquire are derived from Olympian gods, each offering their own set of effects that you can equip to your main moves, or just gain passive buffs that might alter how you approach a given run, there\\'s also 6 different weapons that can later even gain new alterations, even though the game encourages you to try all weapons by buffing the rewards you earn if you use a specific one during your next run, you might just find your favorite one and use it to achieve more victories.\\nThe game also has a wide cast of charming characters that you\\'ll be able to interact with during and before/after a run, deepening your relationship with each as you progress and eventually even unlocking sub stories related to them, allowing them to grow more as characters and friends of yours.\\nOverall this game is a great experience, and from popular word, even if you\\'re unfamiliar with the rougelike genre, this game has proven to find their way to be liked by these people. There is a lot of extra unlockables you can pursue if you decide to, and the game even allows you to pump up the difficulty with set modifiers, to test the skill of those seeking for a greater challenge.\\nThe true GOTY of 2020.',\n",

While I had heard that the game was amazing and a true masterpiece of the FPS RPG Genre I must admit that the artstyle was something that left a sour taste in my mouth as the visuals were particularly not my favourite. However I lost a bet with a friend years ago and he told me that as compensation I had to buy this game and one day do a runthrough with him to truly see what a masterpiece this game was, so I purchased it but still hadn't played it for some time. Then my roommate saw that I owned it and asked if he could use my Steam to play it on my PC every so often, even bought all the DLC shortly afterwards (minus the Commander Lilith DLC that leads into Borderlands 3 which i still have yet to obtain) just so he could play it not far from me while I was chilling on my Playstation or Xbox... And the jokes about this game, all over my facebook and all over my youtube for years even to the point that friends of mine made references to this game in D&D games that I was the Dungeon Master for... It seemed I could not escape my fate from this game, and so finally... as of about 8 days ago... I bit the bullet, got three of my mates, one who hadn't played before either and two that had, and we finally did a runthrough...\\n\\nNow of my 104 hours that the review says I will admit that about 60 of them are actually mine, and the artstyle still annoys the hell out of me to this day BUT the rest of the game? Well it more than makes up for the artstyle's aggravation as this game is fun, hilarious and just left me with too many moments of joy, laughter and WTF episodes and my only regret is that in all honesty I should have played this sooner... I should have been shooting skag's in the mouth just as I left Highschool, I should have been beating down Psycho Midgets well before I moved towns and I sure as hell should have been cracking Handsome Jack's smug skull in WELL BEFORE I started university... But alas my stubbornness and that deplorable artstyle truly got in the way of this otherwise gem in the rough.\\n\\nSo thank you friend of mine for making that bet with me and forcing me to give it an honest go, for the hilarious moments were truly great, thank you players of my games for making references from well written lines and characters from this fantastic game, thank you best friends for joining me on this great crusade through Pandora and helping me to see the fun, thank you 2K for getting this game to all the boys and girls who really wanna smash Psycho's in the wasteland and thank you Gearbox and their staff members for taking the time to make this game as amazing and enjoyable as it is (minus the artists, i'm sorry but I cannot give you any praise as I can never personally forgive the style personally).\\n\\nNow if you'll excuse me...

While waiting I decided to finish my review for this game first.\\n\\nSome of the best games in my library I didn’t play yet because I am still missing DLC like Dishonored or Stellaris as I always want to try to get the full experience of a game before I move onto other backlogs in my libraries. Borderlands 2 has been burning a hole on my playlist for a long time because of missing DLCs. A lot friend told me to play with them for many years but without getting the DLC it just feels weird for me. \\n\\nBeing released for a long time this game is still in very good Quality. Great map design, Story, funny dialogue with awesome voice acting and the little madness in everybody. The interface and gameplay itself are still high standard in today’s game world. Difficulty is a bit higher then needed as game is expected to be play with a bunch of friends. I recommend explore each map and do missions that’s at least 2 level below yours and keep it that way so you don’t have to die too much. \\n\\nLucky for us there is skeleton chest that you can open with golden key you can find by searching internet. Upgrade your guns using that every 4-5 levels or so using it so you don’t have to depend on quest reward and loot drops. Currently there are about 230 keys still available to grab before they expire and they do release more from time to time.\\n\\nI was unlucky enough that play through the entire game + 3 major DLC not a single legendary dropped for me but normal people does have better luck than I do. Ouch, I am going to go cry in a corner now and let’s finish this review quickly.\\n\\n9.5/10 would be my final score for this game as a whole and once I have the last DLC I will play through the game again in new game+ and the other 3 major DLC that I haven’t touched yet. Recommend for anyone and everyone, if you haven’t play this get all expansion on a sale and play now, you need to know the entire Borderlands story as the whole series is going very strong and new games and new expansions are being made constantly.

It's meant to seem more comedic than dark and serious, and it pulls that off very well, even if there are some elements that are not clearly explained and/or can be figured out easily.\\n\\nThe battle mechanics are quite unique; I've never encountered any other system like it. Being able to spare one's opponent is actually a nice touch, though it never works right off the bat, apparently. There's also the defense system, which for me, is one of those things I'm fond of, but I'd improve upon in a couple ways:\\n\\n1) Larger box for multiple enemies (since they all attack at once and it really makes it difficult to avoid attacks at times)\\n2) More chances for healing when being kind/merciful (often times one grabs the green only to get hit for more damage than what was healed and that's just bad-especially at 20 MAX HP)\\n\\nThe different soul/heart types are neat and those I'd not alter in any way, but DAMN, are you SLOW as MOLASSES when you do platforming (blue). Caused me to overestimate many of my jumps. Eh, nitpicky.\\n\\nAh, yes, the main character. Very ambiguous, kinda reminds me of another novella main character I love, only much cuter and far more benign on the surface (nothing is said about their past before the trip down into Mt. Ebott)...and the fact that everyone refers to the main character as they/them is a really good idea considering the main character is the 'silent protagonist' type (is there really a protagonist here?).\\n\\nWhat name did I give the main character? 'Jess'. Not sure why you actually care, but yeah.\\n\\nThere's a lot more I could say, but it would be considered prattling.\\n\\nSo, play it. It's worth getting.

They are now both 4 years old.\\n\\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\\n\\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\\n\\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn\\'t beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\\n\\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\\n\\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don\\'t fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\\n\\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\\n\\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn\\'t be where I am today.

       " 'Tl;dr: I loved this game. This is one of my favorite RPGs period and may be THE best turn-based RPG I’ve played. I think at worst, it takes a little getting used to, but is totally worth it.\\n\\nI started this game in August 2020, when the whole COVID staying indoors thing was really getting old. A couple friends suggested that maybe we could start it up, saying that it’s a lot like a tabletop RPG (or “TTRPG” for short since I’ll be saying that a lot here) and it might be fun to schedule a night weekly to play online together not unlike how a group might play a TTRPG. These are friends who both live far away now and we hadn’t hung out much lately, even online, so I agreed to it without really knowing what I was getting myself into. Trying to keep up with my friends who’d already played the start of the game was a little confusing and at first, I found myself just following them around without really understanding too much what I should be doing and only a bit of what was going on. I admittedly really didn’t have a good time the first session or two because of this but went along with it for the time being. However, once we got a good third or so of the way through the first act, I started recognizing some of the intricacies to the game’s narrative and gameplay that had me intrigued. I became progressively more hooked each session for a while and by the fifth or sixth session, I was loving the game and actively looking forward to our game nights. Once we were about halfway through, I even started my own solo save to catch up to where we were, more thoroughly following the story on my own time without the distraction of other people on voice chat. It took us about 6 months to finish the game, but we never missed a week of playing in all that time and I completed my solo game soon after. Still not getting enough of it, I then reloaded old saves and played another playthrough to get all the rest of the achievements. While it was partially the social aspect of hanging out with old friends online, it’s not an exaggeration to say that this game helped me stay sane during one of the craziest times of my life thus far and it will always hold a special place for me because of it. But that was also in large part because this game is simply awesome. After all, it’s probably the only game that I ended up loving despite not enjoying the first solid 8 hours or so of gameplay. Now, onto the more concrete reasons for that.\\n\\nOne of the most notable things about this game is that it’s essentially an attempt at adapting the feel of a TTRPG to a fully realized digital world. In itself, that’s an old idea. Who hasn’t casually thought “man, this campaign would be great if it were a video game!” But despite attempts like the Elder Scrolls or Fable which, for all their successes, still vastly miss the mark on achieving that feel, this game hits it better than any others I’ve seen. To be clear, I haven’t played any of the Baldur’s Gate or other Divinity games prior to this, so I can’t speak for them, but Original Sin 2 does such an amazing job of this and its success is, in my opinion, actually due to its counterintuitive approach to achieving that goal in that it really doesn’t try to just directly lift a TTRPG system into a game but instead seeks the FEEL of such a game while implementing a style that better fits a video game. While Original Sin 2 has some mechanics you might expect for a game going for that feel such as dialogue options and the freedom to attack most any NPCs you want on a whim, it does several other things that you might not expect but that work out all the same. For instance, one of the big appeals of a TTRPG is that you can do whatever you want within the logic of the game, not just narratively, but with how you maneuver in combat. Video games can’t quite achieve that “anything” mark. There are plenty of games where you think “we’re fighting on a cliff, why can’t I just knock him off the edge?” But there are literally infinite actions like that which developers would have to account for even aside from obvious ones like that to really feel so limitless. Considering those limitations, to help get that feel, Original Sin 2 allows for a multitude of combat options that never feels super limited, even though obviously it is to some extent. First, there are a ton of different skills and leveling provides you with enough points to branch into multiple paths for your builds. But beyond this, much of the environment is interactable and can be used to your advantage. The clearest application of this is the environmental conditions. You can make it rain, causing the wet condition that increases aerothurgy damage (lightning and such), but using lightning can electrify that water, causing shocked status that lowers targets’ ability to perform actions or even stunned, which takes away their entire turn. There’s also cursing environments, potentially preventing healing, and combining that with clouds of air or seas of flame (actually, you’re likely to encounter a lot of those seas of flame throughout the game). You can also break barrels of oil to soak enemies for roasting or use water barrels to create wet conditions. Skills like teleport and the various battlefield/self-warping polymorph abilities also do much more clever manipulations beyond just dealing damage. There’s also the basic system of physical and magic armor that prevents conditions that adds a layer of complexity that encourages strategic play, even though it’s deceptively simple on the surface. While sure, it’s not the same as being able to do anything, I felt throughout the game like there were always lots of options for strategy to employ in any given fight. For me at least, I still felt like I had the variety of options available in a TTRPG, even if it was limited to a finite combination of options. These options are further expanded by the ability to seek strategic positioning, stealth, or pre-cast buffs and environmental conditions. It adds a lot to the game when being stuck on a given fight could be solved by a better approach rather than simply trying to level up, which is good because every fight is scripted without any random encounters, so there’s no way to grind experience other than to do other available fights and quests. \\n\\nOne of the other main things about Original Sin 2 that reminds me of TTRPGs has to do with the world-building, story, and tone. There’s a pretty rich world with lots of different peoples with their own rich histories and varied proclivities, interacting with internal and external factions and nations with their own agendas. On the other hand, I like that the different peoples and factions aren’t the usual monoliths common to fantasy and demonstrate internal diversity as well. There’s plenty of lore to be explored in Rivellon that really makes the stories and locations you encounter come to life. Much of the lore has implications directly on the quests you’ll play through in the story, but there’s also further enriching lore to be found in books and notes you can pick up throughout the world if you want a bit more, though I didn’t do a ton of that reading, generally wanting to just keep playing the game rather than read. While a lot of the focus is on factions and history that impact your story, the feeling of a wider world is the same kind of thing a good TTRPG world features to give life to the world the players are running around in, even outside of the immediate events. \\n\\nFurther, the tone achieved by much of the narrative and story are similarly on point. While there’s a huge variety of game styles for TTRPGs, in my experience one commonality is generally a serious story that inevitably will have some silliness as the players get up to some mischief or another. This leads to what can be dramatic and intriguing storylines that are always willing to step back for a moment of humor that (ideally) doesn’t break you out of the story too hard. This is exactly how I’d desc',\n",

       " \"Just finished this game. With my short attention span, it’s really rare to spend 91h on anything, so they must have done something right. I enjoyed most of my time playing the game and I recommend it but it surely has some flaws.\\n\\nThe dialogue was funny and well written. The characters had interesting stories and a lot of personality, which made you invested in solving their problems and storylines. The voice acting was also great. The visuals are pretty good. The towns, dungeons and castles are well designed and textured. I’m not really a fun of turn-based systems - fighting in RPGs to me has always been a necessary evil - but this system was not bad! It’s intuitive enough to understand what you’re doing but leaves a bit of for experimentation. The maps are very big and exploring them feels very rewarding - there’s not much of dull time spent walking around. There’s always an intriguing chest or a quirky npc that’s needs you to do something for them. The freedom in this game is something I haven’t really experienced in any other RPG - you can solve quests in many ways and you can do almost anything you can think of - steal, kill, trick, flirt, etc. I really started to have fun when I decided embrace my thief character and started to sneak into everywhere I shouldn’t be. Most times this was rewarded with loot, information and, some times, even new quests so it didn’t felt inconsequential. Other games would just give me a tag for dialogue. Of course this amount of freedom led to some bugs here and there, but nothing too game breaking.\\n\\nHere are a few things that could be better (spoiller alert):\\n- The quest system is a bit confusing, there’s too much information and no way to filter it out.\\n- There’s too much googling needed. I tried to avoid cheating as much as I could but I spent a lot of time looking at my phone.\\n- The inventory is hard to manage and could have more filter options and marquee selection.\\n- Surfaces are an interesting mechanic but some of them clutter the screen. Water and ice are ok, but fire and poison, for example, are way too much - sometimes you can't even see your character.\\n- The ending felt underwhelming and rushed. The character stories where way more rewarding to finish than the main quest.\\n- The “cutscenes” could be more epic. They’re just concept art with a tiny bit of animation. Lack of budget, maybe? And why is Windego narrating?\\n- This is more of an opinion, but too much moral ambiguity in characters can make them all feel similar. They turn into a grey canvas with some specific motivations tossed on top. Sometimes that’s not enough to make you care.\\n- No more sob stories with animals, please. I almost quit playing after the finding Emmie thing. And then you throw bear cubs, pigs, little chickens… at me? No-one wants this, trust me!\\n\\nGenerally this is a very good game with a lot of potential, but has a few small flaws that, all together, prevent it from being an AMAZING game. 75/100\",\n",

I'm no stranger to turn based RPG's, played XCOM 2, The Shadowrun series, and some Dragon Quest games so I started this off thinking this'll be a breeze. Boy was I wrong. \\n\\n[b] Story [/b]\\nFor a guy who has no knowledge of Divinity lore, the game explains it to me very well. I understood in the first act of the game what the gist is by reading every single book and interacting with every NPC available. Gets more detailed as you go on and that's a treat, I'm a sucker for lore. You won't get the whole story of all the previous games but it's summarized neatly that you won't have to play the other games to understand what the hell is going on here. Be warned, lots of reading.\\n[b] Characters [/b]\\nLove them. Every Origin companion has a neat story behind them and you'll understand where they're coming from once you finish their story quests. Your choice of companions is a factor on how some encounters will go. They'll give out pieces of lore as well. Only nitpick I have is that they don't interact with each other, only with you, so if you're used to Mass Effect or Dragon Age companion banter you won't get it here. \\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\\nOne thing this game has taught me is that if you want to survive the bullshit being thrown at you like enemies spawning behind you and getting a free hit is that you have to throw bullshit at them as well. Exploit everything. This game won't hold your hand. You're maybe in the starting area but you'll bash your head in a wall if you don't start learning how to be creative. The game begs you to exploit every single thing it has to offer so don't be ashamed to do it. There's more than one way to get out of every encounter here so don't be afraid to experiment as well. \\n[b] Bugs [/b]\\nFew and far between. Game breaking bug I ever got was that I can't click anything to get out of a menu and had to reset my game. Mostly inconveniences. \\n\\nMy overall experience with this game is that I hated at first because I can't wrap my head around what to do but once I got around it I loved every single bit of it. It deserves every praise it has. \\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I love pretty much every component: the large variety of weapons, the diversity of builds you can create, the sweaty victory over a hard boss.\\n\\nNow, lets dive into the pros and cons of Dark Souls III, shall we?\\n\\nPros:\\n-Good visuals. I particularly admire the level of detail\\n-Loads of quality bosses\\n-The opportunity to play co-op\\n-Well-designed weapons and armour\\n-Class/build diversity\\n-The difficulty\\n-Mod support\\n\\nCons:\\n-While playing online, fantoms(hostile players) join your game too often(and I usually die, cuz I'm nub)\\n-Because of high level of detail, shimmering can be seen if the screen resolution is not high enough(I played 2560x1440, shimmering could be seen).

Monster Hunter achieves a fine line of unique game-play with challenging enemies and difficulties. From the variation of weapon types, attacks, design to their gameplay benefits and downsides, Monster Hunter is compelling and filled with a wealth of enemy types and unique engagements. I wouldn't recommend this game if you're looking for a gripping story as it's quite obvious from the get-go that the whole thing is just a basic premise to justify capturing and slaying massive monsters.\\n\\nIt's one downside is nearly a plague on the experience: it's nonsensical menu design and user-experience. Some examples would be that friends cannot join in my experience if I have not experienced a cutscene for a specific monster or event. Additionally, their menu design is not only cumbersome and excessive, but can easily be cut down. Other routines that bog down the experience range from every fight needing yourself to 'buff' yourself with key consumables as well as the routine walk-around to different storefronts to collect ingredients, materials and more without any real challenge, just the repetitive action(s) of doing them every so often.\",\n",

The combat systems are in general the same across all the series, with little bonus mechanics added in/taken out of each installment. This game allows you the freedom of choice for weapons, and they all are absolutely amazing when played properly. Each one has specific playstyles, or even cater to specific groups of people. Of course, there are \\'metas\\', like the Longsword and Bowguns, but that doesn\\'t make the others any less viable. \\n\\nOf course, the MH franchise also has a great learning curve. I like to compare the combat to Dark Souls, as more people know/have heard of it, but with a lot more gradual, eased in learning curve. You\\'re not just plopped into a \\'tutorial\\' boss that\\'ll mop the floor with you, you work your way up to those creatures, learning your weapon(s) along the way. It\\'s really, REALLY well done for teaching people the combat system, and even the dodge mechanic. Even if it has way less i-frames than any dark souls, heh.\\n\\nLast but not least, unlike all the previous MH games, World actually feels ALIVE. Open world maps, creatures that fight against each other and not with each other like all the past games, even the use of scoutflies is great. As the old way of tracking didn\\'t make all that much sense to me personally (paintballs). Even invasive creatures interrupting your fight feels more natural, as they usually have turf wars, some of which are absolutely awesome (rajang vs jho).

When I first picked it up, I was looking to see where Bethesda had come from and was looking for another similar experience. I loaded it up and was faced with characters made of plasticine, weird dialogue and a floaty combat system that actually killed me if I just ran ahead blindly. I did not like it.\\n\\nA couple of years on, I came back. I think the biggest shock for me was how different it was and I expected to understand it based on Skyrim. Oblivion is not Skyrim. It's so much more. Oblivion is colourful, funny in all the right ways and the writing... the writing for the quests is phenomenal. There are many characters that you'll find yourself remembering so much further down the line, quests that just stand out as iconic and generally a much more fantastical feeling than I ever got with Skyrim. I've loved both, but give me a choice between the two and I'll gladly step into Cyrodiil for another go. \\n\\nThe combat handles like you're swinging a pool noodle, but magic is where the combat in this game shines. The level of customisation and the utility of spells is phenomenal, and when you consider how easy it can be to mod this game you can fix any niggling issues you come across. \\n\\nI don't know what it is about the NPC dialogue, but even though it's comically bad it's so warming to the heart. The characters care about the world, and even if one will sit there bringing up some major threat only to be met with a complaint about mudcrabs, they all feel connected to the place they live in.

       " 'INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE\\nIntroduction\\n\\n1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.\\n\\n2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.\\n\\n3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.\\n\\n4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.\\n\\n5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.',\n",

But now, over a year past launch, I have to give this a 'do not recommend' at this price.\\n\\nFirstly, singleplayer is still barely fleshed out.  Constant updates make it difficult to keep your mods up to date and there are still numerous bugs and glitches that simply shouldn't be there at this stage of the game.  The devs are clearly relying on the modding community to create content.  That would be fine if the game were $29.99, but it isn't.  It's $49.99.  For that price, you expect more.\\n\\nMultiplayer is a disaster.  First of all, queues are glacial.  I'm trying to play on a Saturday and queues are 5-15 minutes.  The fact is that the multiplayer side is basically dead.  And it's little wonder.  In over a YEAR, we still don't have basic features.  There's no loadouts that you can save (even though you can set them in the Armory).  Creating kits/loadouts is a basic feature in most other games.  There's still no ranking system.  No Clan Battle system.  Basically, there's nothing.  The matches themselves are becoming more and more unbalanced, since after 5-15 minutes, you and a couple randoms usually get thrown into a match with the 3-4 people who have been maining in Bannerlord for the last year.  \\n\\nI really wanted to like this game, but it's just not worth the $49.99.  It lacks content.  The development has been glacially slow.  The multiplayer is a dying disaster.  Worst of all, the devs haven't seemed to do that much.  There are mod teams that have created more content in six months than the Devs have in over a year.  It's basically like the Devs expect the players to create and fix the game, which is NOT worth $49.99.  It can be fun, but definitely wait for it to be on sale for $29.99 or less.\",\n",

Your troops will only use one ladder, and even then only go up a hand full at a time which means they get immediately killed by the couple enemy troops waiting at the top. The rest of your troops are just kinda jumbled at the bottom of the tower all trying to climb the one ladder.... even though there are two more right next to it.

Should we be excited though? Well, as the Germans would say, jein.\\n\\n\"Ja\" because the game improved several aspects. The UI looks much better. They introduced a much needed siege system, in which you actually need to build siege engines to storm a castle - and it is magnificent! There are more commands to control your troops, and they added a smithing system which was severely lacking in the Warband version. They also introduced caravans which is a cool addition.\\n\\n\"Nein\" because teh game is still VERY raw. It is terribly optimized. On lowest settings at FHD (GTX2060) the battles stutter a lot. You have to pass a Will Roll of Diff 25 to endure playing large sieges as a PowerPoint presentation. The smithing system is simply broken. The best two handed swords you craft, using rare materials, will be ~20k worth. A JAVELIN can go as high as 180k. That breaks the economy too - once you can craft javelins you achieved infinite money.\\n\\nThe leveling system seems broken beyond repair and I hope the devs redo it from scratch. There are 6 attributes, each with 3 skills attached. The only purpose of the attributes is to determine how far/fast you can level its skills. You can only level skills by USING them, but as they get closer to the cap, you get a multiplier penalty, e.g. you get only 1/2, then 1/4, until you get no exp at all. To mitigate that, the devs added a \"focus points\" which increases the cap/multiplier for a single skill only (max 5 focus per skill). You get 1 focus point per level, 1 attribute point per 4 levels. The progression is non-linear i.e. the higher the level of the character/skill, the more exp points it needs to progress - but you get LESS exp points due to the multiplier penalty. To eventually get max attributes, you\\'d need to reach lvl 200-ish.\\n\\nIt is much more intuitive than it sounds. The key problem is that, to level up, you need to progress skills. But to progress skills you need to level up. The non-linear behaviour is TERRIBLY balanced. Even after cheating to get all attributes to 10 (max speed/cap to all skills), after ~40h my character is barely lvl 35 (remember, non-linear; so it gets much worse later). If you try to focus in one attribute/group of skills, you\\'ll level up even slower. Yes, in Bannerlord, specializing is bad!\\n\\nOnce you create a kingdom, your lords force you to declare war on every kingdom with less troops. Lords with traits such as \"Honour\" and \"Honesty\" pass their time pillaging villages. You can also send your companions to form parties to protect your own settlements, but instead they will join the murdering as well - but IN YOUR NAME! There is no \"toggle\". You can\\'t say \"no, bad boy, sit.\" You can control some policies of your kingdom, but there is no \"Chill Daddy\" policy and everybody is bloodthirsty the whole time.\\n\\nI ran out of space but I could still rant about marriage, charming/persuasion, the way the NPCs creeply smile at you as if they\\'d had mushrooms, the lack of armor crafting, customized troops trees and of a potato at the end of this post.\\n\\nMount & Blade is one of my favourite games of all times and Bannerlord SURELY sounds promising.

The story is incredible and filled with brilliantly written and acted characters. \\n\\nThe protagonist, Ichiban, has quite the boots to fill now that we're not playing as Kiryu anymore. Ichiban is an amazing protagonist and without question does Kiryu justice. The emotional range is wider, and the positive outlook on everything that Ichiban invigorates sets him apart from Kiryu. They're both masterpieces of character development, writing and acting. \\n\\nThe gameplay is incredibly fun and addicting.

There's tons of loot, materials for crafting gear, and an enormous variety of enemy designs.

There's dungeons, tons of bosses and minibosses, an endgame activity that's very difficult, and more. There's well over 100 hours worth of content here and it all improves you and your party's abilities. \\n\\nMy complaints are negligible, there's sometimes too many enemies on the streets.

       " '[h2][b]Score: 8.5/10[/b][/h2]\\n\\nYou play as Ichiban Kasuga. A naive young yakuza member who ends up in politics of his yakuza family and then later the entire country of Japan’s government. The story is incredibly well written and directed, and I was hooked from beginning to end, at least the story and characters. I love the characters here as they have tons of heart, soul, and personality that make you want to see them through to the end of their journey. The first three chapters of the game are pretty much story and character building. In fact, I didn’t really get to do anything outside of watching cut scenes for the first three hours of the game. I just ran to spots that triggered them and I watched this complex web of characters build their story up, and I wasn’t upset as I was glued to my screen the whole time.\\n\\nThis is the first time I’ve finished a Yakuza game and a rare completion of a JRPG. Usually, JRPGs have great stories and characters, but something within the game keeps me from finishing it. Be it unfair and insane difficulty, too much grinding or late-game issues pop up like needing to quest for something very specific and it makes the progression grind to a halt. Like a Dragon is the first in the series to play like a JRPG and not an action game. The story is fantastic and the characters are well written and memorable, but that’s probably the strongest thing going for the game, and it’s the reason why I slumped through the late game issues to see it through to the end.\\n\\nOnce you get past a certain point in the story, honestly I can’t say anything as every little detail could be a major spoiler, you finally get let loose in the world. However, with this being a JRPG let’s talk about combat first. The game is played in a turned-based style, but characters move around on their own in the arenas. Depending on your job you have various skills that can cause major damage, and this is super important and the core of the entire game. While base attacks are fine early on in the game, they don’t do much later on and you start relying on skills that all use MP whether they’re physical or magic-based. Each attack has a type such as magic, slashing, piercing (guns), bashing, or blunt (physical) attacks. Some attacks might have elemental attributes attached to them, but you really must balance your team. You need characters that can heal, do large AoE damage, and lots of damage to single enemies. It’s important you have a class that can do one of each of those things as it’s key to winning battles.\\n\\nEarly on in the game, the difficulty feels perfect. There were some challenges, I had to use strategy, and really focus on ranking up my character’s jobs and learn enemy weaknesses. This is also a key point in the battle system. Like a Dragon mocks or makes fun of other games like Pokemon. Early on you come across someone similar to Professor Oak and the entire scene plays out like the beginning of every Pokemon game. It’s pretty funny. The point of this is you acquire a bestiary of each enemy type and when you fight in battle and discover a weakness it will appear over the character when you select that attack. This is vital to winning boss fights and harder battles late game or just in general.\\n\\nRanking up your job is more important than leveling up your character honestly. This determines your max health, how powerful your attacks are, and learning new attacks. You get more powerful attacks as you rank up, but the downside is once you change a job you start from the bottom on that job. So you have to grind that job to level it up, and late-game this is incredibly tedious, but more on the late-game problems later. There are thankfully no random battles, but enemies walk around outside that can be avoided. When you fight enemies the environment is also important as smaller areas are great for attacks that do AoE damage and it allows you to wipe out enemies faster in bigger groups. \\n\\nOutside of combat, there are a ton of mini-games like in every Yakuza game. Karaoke, classic Sega arcade games in Club Sega, crane games, driving ranges, go-karts, and many others. They’re fun at first, but there’s not really any reason to do these mini-games outside of acquiring items. Items are also an important part to combat as the most powerful armor and weapons are almost unobtainable until you can start raking in serious cash at the Battle Arena in chapter 12 and fighting the more powerful enemies late game. You can also upgrade Ichiban’s weapons (only his weapons can be upgraded) and well as craft new items, but honestly, this is only needed if you can’t afford to buy them. There are no unique weapons or armor that can be crafted exclusively, at least that I noticed, and once I started raking in serious cash in the millions I just bought everything and crafting became pointless towards the end of the game.\\n\\nAs you progress through the first eleven chapters hopping around taxis to fast travel to spots, unraveling the story, ranking up your jobs, leveling characters, acquiring new armor and weapons and items, and all this sounds like a normal JRPG affair, but then chapter twelve comes and knocks you on your ass. This is when most people will probably quit the game as it turns into a completely different beast and the way you play must change. This is the worst part about the game, and I don’t see how this was necessary. The game had a perfect flow and difficulty level leading up to this chapter. The first sign hits you when you must acquire 3 million Yen for a specific reason in the story. By now you probably have a couple hundred thousand yen at the most. How am I going to get this much money as street thugs don’t really payout and I can only sell so much? Well, the first stupid idea was that there are specific things you need to do to get this money and they don’t tell you. First, you have a watch in your inventory that’s worth one million yen. You need to sell that and then there is a specific Hero Quest you must complete that gives you two million yen. You need to take ten photos of a statue hidden throughout the city. What a serious pain in the ass. I knew right here that the game was going to be a chore from here on out. Then to make matters worse, the last statue is hidden behind insanely difficult enemies out of nowhere. They were many 8 levels above me, but that wasn’t a problem before. I had to grind for a couple of hours just to beat them to take that photo. Such nonsense!\\n\\nIt just gets worse from here. Chapter seven had you complete one of two long dungeons in the game. It was challenging, but not impossible. This dungeon is the only way to grind up until now. However, once you get to a new small city you unlock the battle arena, and this is your main way to level grind by climbing floors and beating waves of enemies. You will be here for probably 6-8 hours minimum. At this point in chapter twelve, you come across a boss fight that cranks the difficulty up to nearly unfair and impossible. I had to grind 15 levels just to get a fair advantage. This boss just absorbs so much damage and throwing all my powerful attacks at him still kicked my ass. I died and retried nearly a dozen times before I almost gave up. I’d grind five or six levels and try again until I could finally do it.\\n\\nThe game at least has amazing voice acting (in Japanese of course), and the graphics are pretty good technically, but pretty boring on an artistic level. These are hyper-realistic graphics and the only artistic flair is the enemy designs. I enjoyed the music as well, but in the end, the last few chapters will test your patience. The mini-games are fun, the sub-stories are boring and repetitive, and the post-chapter twelve grinding is an absolute chore and really hurts the game. However, if you can prevail, get through the grinding, and learn the strategy of balancing your parties jobs you will get through an incredible and memorable story with great characters.',\n",
