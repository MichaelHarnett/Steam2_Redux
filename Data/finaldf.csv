Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"Absolutely garbage servers and net-code for public game play! This is a high level competitive game in 2021 and Valve has completely lost touch with modern technology. This could be a much better experience for players if Valve would invest some of it's billions back into functioning servers and the community instead of milking it's customers with minimal return when those customers made Valve what they are today. Outdated 64 tic rate on servers, de-synchronization, archaic net-code, and glaring imbalance is commonplace in this game. If you want to play a game that makes you hate yourself almost as much as you hate the tease this game is, go ahead and waste your time playing this game and fooling yourself into thinking skill matters and you'll get better with time. If I were to imagine Hell, the perfect analog would be someone trapped playing this game on an endless loop."

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"After putting a decent amount of time into this game I have come to find that is all in all an enjoyable game to play(especially so with friends). As far as playing games go I have always liked playing competitive fps' as I find they are fun to learn and it is satisfying to do well as much as it is fun to win in ranked. The skill threshold for this game is sufficiently high while you can still play it casually and enjoy it if you don't mind getting destroyed by the occasional smurf every now and then. if you want to improve however this is the easiest way to do so.

-Learn recoils for different weapons.(workshop maps are amazing for this)
-Learn nades( pop flashes, smoke and molly lineups etc)
-Up to preference but as I'm still learning all the maps I stick to one or two maps when I play before switching  to another once I'm confident on that map and can remember smokes and where to play.
-Watch pro league watching better people play can help you learn how to play.
-Youtube videos on how to play are good but I mainly just recommend watching them for nade lineups and good positions to play.
-As good as trying to play like a pro like stewie2k sounds just make sure to remember what works for pros might not necessarily work for you as you probably don't have the game knowledge or aim that they have i.e. as cool as being like the smoke criminal may sound rushing through t smoke when you're ct probably isn't the greatest idea.(unless you have REALLY good aim in which case who knows it might work out for you.)

Solid 10/10 game if you have good trust factor and time to sink into it."
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"Valve I love you, but wtf is that new update, you're essentially making the game pay to play, I know you're doing this to reduce cheaters and smurf but there has to be a better way to fix this problem, you're just making this almost dead game into a dead game. I'm writing this not because i hate the game, I love this game, I've been playing CS from CS 1.6 to CSGO and I want this game to be popular again, so for now I'm gonna say that for the newcomer you better off playing valorant than CSGO until valve fix the new update.

(sorry if there's any misspelling or weird writing, english is not my first language)"
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,ruined my social life :D
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,The best game ever.!!
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"Mixed feelings.

Gameplay-wise one of the best shooters ever, with an unbearable amount of cheaters and a not so great community.
"
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,i like moster truck and fire truck
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"no words to describe how bad this game is.

just go to aimware.net to catch up to the competition because as soon as you get in game, someone on the other team will spin bot the entire game whilst his entire team are laughing in chat.

100% nobody at valve plays this game and or gives a sh!t about it."

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"Much more better playing with friends but if you like toxicity and want to learn Russian at the same time then this game is perfect, Highly recommend."
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"absolutely every game, with prime status, against or for cheaters"
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,Help
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"With the most recent update I kinda want to rest my case with CSGO via a review. 

The game is pretty much a basic 5v5 search and destroy game that requires practice, effort, and teamwork to succeed. However the only experience I've really gotten in the end was toxicity & some teamwork. I wouldn't take the game to serious because its a game. 

The battles are hit or miss between adrenaline filled & getting shot by a guy with a one shot weapon across the map. And although there are only a small handful of guns they could be taken with many different strategies (like sniping with a shotgun). However majority of gunfights will either consist of AK's, M4's, & AWP's. 

An occurring problem for folks is that there's an outbreak of hackers. I've had a handful of them I've went against. Rather instead of Valve fortifying there system they just made the entire ranking system premium only. Now if you want to ruin someones day it'll cost you 15.99 USD (+tax). But now the new players have to deal with the folks locked out with the pay wall. Scaring them off. 

But at this point the main focus of the game is Micro-Transactions. immediately your met with a paywall if you want to get competitive with the game. Followed by the pretty skins that Valve add whenever they need an extra bit of cash. It feels like the game is less of a game and more of a Slot Machine with a game next to it. People get urges to unbox because of streamers, people lose their money, Valve gets it all, and it cycles. 

I took a brake in March of 2021 because I felt I was getting worse at it & was devoting almost 3/4 of my day to it. Now it's uninstalled, and is left as a scar on my life for the time I wasted on something that I'm never going to use again. 

At the end would I recommend CS:GO? With a clear mind I don't think so. Although the gameplay was fun at certain times the bads stack far over the goods."

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"When you make a game free to play and give the opportunity to gamers to play ranked games and games spend time to climb, it is just disgusting to get it back a year later.
Devs fix your matchmaking, remove toxic trolls and cheaters, and take back this ridiculous update.
JUST A JOKE!"
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,This game is so bad that it made the world worse by existing.
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"Cheaters + bad trust... = I have 90% games with cheaters atm (soft cheat or hardcore aimbot and spin).

To all of you cheaters, you have small cat d**k and too bad for you, there are no cheat for love and sex performance. You will all die alone and be remembered as poor performers by women.

Also what i find disgusting is Valve making money on cheaters but at our expanse... We spend hundreds of shitty hours so they can win 14$ on a new account.

This is my favorite game and I really feel exploited and neglected. But I got used to it with time.

Please take good care of us Valve. Kind regards,

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"Counter-Strike used to be a fantastic game with a fantastic community. I spent many hours on this game either playing competitive with friends or meeting new people in public lobbies. Rarely would I encounter cheaters and, when I did, there was a community consensus to kick them. 

It's completely different now. Counter-Strike is completely infested with cheaters, new and old. The ability to simply download any rage hack you want, join a competitive lobby and steamroll the other team has completely ruined the competitive aspect of the game for myself and others alike. 

Valve has let this game turn into a complete disgrace."

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"Difficult to answer. As expected the CS GO system can't prevent cheaters from join in the game.  Valve must develop a new powerful initiative to fight against that or will be left behind!  Human minds are being affected by inducing psychologies problems into next Human generation. We are sadly VALVE ""Failure to Act""."

Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,"After Ep*c Games gave it for free, cheaters increased a lot, after 1300 hours I gave up completely, I prefer to catch animals with my friends in Red Dead Online."
Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,"Just a few years ago all the cheater's capabilities was spawning UFOs, changing weather, caging every player in session and other ""non-harmful"" annoying stuff. But today I've met cheater chasing me across [u]private[/u] sessions and even solo heist.
It's getting worse and worse with cheaters situation in GTA Online and Rockstar did nothing useful to fix it. There's known information about cheaters extracting your IP via game for DDoS attacks and even finding your location.
This shit is not fun anymore, it's straight up terrifying and dangerous.
[i]GTA Online has to be abandoned and never be played again.[/i] I personally don't want to launch it ever again.

Oh, the Story Mode (singleplayer) of this game is cool. Worth buying



*Review update*

I think I should mention few thing:
Yes, Online is fun and interesting
Yes, it's very unlikely that you meet a cheater chasing you, extracting your location, overheating your computer or blaming you in cheating which will lead to your account banning
Yes, if there was no such dangerous cheaters in Online, I would definitely recommend buying and playing it

But your luck may end one day and you will meet a cheater making something from above to you. Before buying the game or playing Online part of it — just be aware of what can happen, don't let it be a surprise for you"
Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,Sometimes male cops have female voices
Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,how do you sex
Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,great experience
Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,"For the story I can recommend but for online it's debatable, It can be great and fun with friends but there are so many hackers/modders who control the servers and ruin the game for everybody that it's impossible/unenjoyable to play, It also takes centuries to load up the damn game in the first place. Getting the game for the story, It's great, Highly recommend but for online I highly advise against getting it unless you are willing to go through Hell and torture."
Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,This is the best game ever. I love this fame more than anything in my entire life. If this game stopped existing Id itch my ballz
Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,"HOW this isn't a free game at this point is beyond me, I'm actually shocked by how much developers have been under fire in the past year (Hardcore WoW player) in the time that I've been waiting for Blizzard to release new content I figured ""hey let's pick up GTA 5, the online has looked really fun"" I know I CLEARLY should have done my research before buying this ""game"" but I figured Rockstar would have things locked down on an 8 year old game. I WAS SO WRONG, if you are truly looking to buy this game take in the fact that the Dev's truly do not care about third party mods and totally rely on the players in lobbies to do THEIR jobs. If you're actually trying to play this game, and progress I WARN you, you WILL get spawn camped multiple times a day, you WILL have multiple times in a day where you don't know wtf is going on to your character, you WILL search for a new session on a regular. This game is so fucking tedious, that even the Devs' try to force feed money cards, that if you buy you surely have mental issues because people can literally money drop for you. In every online game that a normal gamer has played, this is called hacking/cheating but because these half assed dev's who apparently don't give two shits, ""Modding"" is okay. You've killed your game to any true gamer that cares about progression, and I get its an old AF game. But some people have been playing MMO's, MOBA'S, etc for years and this is honestly so disheartening to play. I truly am glad I bought this on sale, this isn't a game 50% of the time. And the Dev's/Community should truly feel embarrassed."
Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,too much cheater and toxic player at online
Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,"GTA Online is full of cheaters, racists, and the worst, most vile trolls in the world. However, I'm a masochist and love this game."

Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,"GTA V Online Now
-Bugs & glitches in every new heist, some of them can make the mission unplayable. ex: Casino heist with guards that aren't walking around as they should've been. Cayo Perico heist, invisible walls around the island make you unable to climb up the island regardless of the steepness, for instance you could not clime a 10 degree because of it.
-Hackers bombing other innocent players or force you to be pulled into their apartment, you can't to anything of course.
-Children with bad parenting destroy people minding their own business using FLYING BIKES, some of them do this for their K/D. Honestly, is a K/D number even needed in such game? It just made things worse than ever.
-AI with AIMBOT shooting you without missing once. Stupid as hell. Some argue this is because by making the game harder   Rockstar can boost thier sales in Sharkcards. I think it is just laziness.
-NPCs don't drive new cars in every new update, the road just look all the same.
-NPCs drives so bad that they crash into you IN PURPOSE, why is this? They ram into you without any reason and its not even a rare event,
-Connection still sucks.
-Bad Chinese people spamming advertise of their LIVE PORN WEBSITES and HACK CLIENTS, c'mon, what is this? You can't run from this only if you only play in single player online or only friends lobby.
Overall a bad experience. But the hope in Rockstar fixing things makes me keep playing, god help us."

Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,I would like to start this review by saying that GTA V is in my top 5 favourite video games of all time. The single player story mode is breathtaking and the opportunity to switch between 3 characters that all have there own distinct personalties you get attached to is incredible. You get immediately hooked on the story because of its dark humour and constant twists and turns. Now moving on to GTA online. The plethora of different ways you can approach GTA online is one of the modes biggest strengths.You can be that one guy that always destroys someone else's cargo or you can be a multi millionaire CEO. The multitude of different things this mode offers cannot be described in words. EVERYONE HAS TO EXPERIENCE THIS!

Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,"Hands down one of the greatest open world open world games ever made. The characters are fun and interesting, the gameplay is easy to pick up yet challenging. Online however is a pay to win cesspool with tons of overpower vehicles that are extremely hard to near impossible to fight against for a new player making the game extremely hard to pick up for new player. If you chose to not spend many money on shark cards (the games form of pay to win) then the game will become extremely grindy, often times taking many hours to get enough money to buy a decent weaponized vehicle or fast car. This can be slightly alleviated if you have a friend to carry you through Cayo Perico a few times but still takes some time to get good gear. 

Single Player: 9/10
Multiplayer: 6/10"

To be honest 72% of siege players are coppers on McDonald’s WiFi, unless they’re on the enemy team, then they’re ex pro league with a well coordinated 5-stack."

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"I got verbally abused by Russians that can't speak English.
Fun times"
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"I've been playing this game since release, and while I don't hate the game for what it is today, it has just lost the spark of that incredibly tactical and realistic feel. I'm not one to go ""new=bad"", and there were sci-fi elements on release (like Jager's anti-grenades, though they were all believable back then), but what I enjoyed about the game is gone at this point. You won't find the tactical shooter where every death massively changes the game and teamwork is essential to every step in a realistic feel, but a load of a million different traps you have to get around, memorizing what 50+ characters do to even be able to fight them, characters that their abilities feel like they're meant for a game (not an actual raid scenario), and devs pushing out power-creep characters, making the classics rarely used. (like seriously what did they do to thatcher?) It took them 6 years to make the most useless operator (Tachanka) into something good. Did they do this with other useless operators? Castle? Nope. Blitz? Buffed then destroyed by nerf. Alibi? Nope! Doc? Only useful in casual. Finka? Monty? Glaz? Lion? Doki doki? Warden? ANYONE?
No. But the new operator is going to be overpowered! Then nerfed 2 months in... (This has always been a problem)

The game isn't bad, but it's not what it was. Feels like 1 step forwards, 2 steps back with it. If you're unsure on whether to get the game, watch some streams (both old and new), and see if you like the new style it's gone to, but personally, I do not. I genuinely say though, check this game out. You may have a lot of fun with it"
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,after supporting this game for so long... i cannot recommend siege because of the direction they are heading
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,Honestly this game used to be fun but all the new updates ruined it.
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,if you want to beat your wife and kids this is the game for you before playing i was in a healthy relationship now i have 4 domestic abuse charges
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"Rainbow Six Siege is a complex game that requires a lot of mental focus and determination. With a strong mental focus towards the game you will have an incredible performance in your matches. I would say that once you have a ""team"" of other players, you can work together to build skills and adapt to your future matches.

Otherwise, Ubisoft endeavors to develop new operators whilst communicating with the tetchy player base.


It's a fun game and headbanger, just don't let it break you."
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"Other than the super sweaty toxic tryhard's in casual / quickplay this game is a lot of fun.

Even after 3 years of not playing, I can still recommend this, also more fun with friends!"
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"Used to be kind of good, a bit rough around the edges but a great multiplayer tactical shooter. 

Well it pretty much lost what it was supposed to be, became call of duty but with destructable walls. (Aesthetically)

Most of the current fanbase is pretty toxic, many of them have more of a stockholm syndrome relationship with it.

Still has a ton of game breaking bugs, even after more than 5 years. 

Does not deserve the name Rainbow Six."
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"With the hours i have (111) on PC and around 500 on console because my friends are on those platforms I can't recommend this game in the state its in even in the future and i'll list my reasons. The game is far from what it was 2017 - 2019 to now what made siege great was that it was a tactical military shooter fighting terrorists and all that, now we have operators that are completely sci fi it also has gotten really confusing with all these operators left right and centre its hard to keep track, another thing that stings is the removal of maps or reworking of maps without keeping the original and just removing it from existence. the ranked scene and even casual is even horrible with horrible teammates being completely toxic and never wanting to help anyone even new players team killing just because of a mistake don't get me wrong its funny as all fuck in casual or when you're just messing around but when you want to chill and play or even concentrate to play ranked it gets frustrating and makes you want to quit, you'll meet good people trust me I've met friends and still talk to them to this day. I'm going to mention another problem specifically the console which isn't a problem here  i ask ubisoft to at least contact microsoft and playstation of the MNK problem for consoles its gotten so horrendous that i can't even play casual anymore to just chill with my mates no word or anything has been said about the issue just "" Oh we don't condone it please don't do it"" But what does that achieve? Nothing and it'll only get worse making console player base get smaller and smaller of the people who just don't want to cheat or they'll cave and spend horrendous amount of money on a xim just to get good when the thing doesn't even mimic mouse movement correctly. 

I'll close out this review from a person who loved siege and played it religiously and got platnium twice i loved it for the fact it offered challenge where i was used to games like cod and overwatch where almost every move counted or you had to at least think of what you were doing instead of just roaming around shooting like a idiot this game told you  you "" this isn't cod don't treat it like it"" And let me tell you when i first started out it was hard i died almost every round but i was still having fun i loved this games community with tachanka jokes and annual events that i got excited for I've made amazing memories with this game with 1V5 and aces i don't write this review as a hater i write it as a person who loved siege and watched every singe trailer for new season i wish to see change though i doubt with how ubisoft treats its employees and the way they package their games as some lazy open world i doubt we'll see anything of that nature so for right now siege will be this hero sci fi shooter which has lost its identity."
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,Ubisoft is destroying the game more and more by every update
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"Terrible game. Used to be good, Ubisoft has ruined it. The last straw was when the match was cancelled after my internet went out for a few seconds. I attempted to reconnect, only to be met with an ""Error"" message. Lo and behold, after numerous attempts at reconnecting, I was banned for twice the usual time. This is because the idiots at Ubisoft decided it'd be a great idea to extend the rank abandonment penalty to 60 minutes. Will not play again."
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"I used to really like this game a lot. But a lot of the new UI ""features"" and how jolting it is on the camera when you die now, definitely can't recommend now."
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"Não joguem essa desgraça, esse jogo já foi bom, hoje em dia é só pra ganhar dinheiro, fuck u ubisoft!!!! :D"
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"Oh siege, now before I get into this review, it will be very in-depth and i'm writing this at the time of year 6 season 2 (operation North Star)
Don't get me wrong siege is a good game and recommend it for people who love a fps fast pace shooter, however there are many factors to take into account when buying this game, I have played siege since operation Chimera (Year 3 season 1) and there were only about 40 ops, back then the game was a lot more simple and fun, nowadays you can't find yourself in a game without an ash or vigil main running around with 12 kills, and before you say ""you just have to get good""   most new players encounter these players on a regular basis and it hurts the game because new players can't get to learn the game and progress their skill, I know there is a Newcomer game mode but since it is dominated by smurfs, it makes it impossible to play in as a new player. Siege has a very big learning curve to get used to for many people from aim to map knowledge so I recommend that you watch a guide before playing. I want to move on to the community now, there is way to much toxicity in siege, from people getting mad and using voice/typing chat to abuse and bully, to just getting team killed for reinforcing the wrong wall. I wish the siege community will get better and maybe it will in a couple years.
To wrap this review up, if you are a die heart fan for fps and shooters then I 100% recommend siege, if you are just a newbie or a person looking to have fun and not sweat then siege is not for you.
I hope there isn't many spelling or grammar issues and thanks for reading my opinion."

The new ops are okay i g u e s s, but playing this shit on Xbox for y e a r s, they've just completely abandoned the casual space and making certain operators useless is just tastless and really stupid."

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,i am bad so i dont liek this game
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"Once upon a time this game used to be amazing, one could call it critically acclaimed. But after updates removing the maps that made this game great, adding in shitty new maps  and adding more and more unrealistic characters to what was once a realistic fps shooter . This game makes me critically ashamed, and its full of sweaty toxic nerds camping at a window to pop your ass at the spawn. This shit is so bad it will build grey matter in your brain if you play it too long. Go do yourselves a favour and buy Zero Hour a real tactical squad based 5v5 shooter that doesn't make you want to kill yourself"
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"The gameplay itself is quite fun, especially with friends. Very tactical, encourages diverse team rosters and communication.
Gunplay sometimes feels off with close to zero feedback on hits and especially the killcams can be puzzling.

(Be prepared for absolute a-wipes, toxic people and griefers of course, this being a multiplayer game with voice chat.)

However, I cannot recommend it in good faith due to the following reason: the core monetization.
Sure lootboxes and in-game currencies and microtransactions blabla, we all know the drill, but that's not why.

The real Ubisoft scumbaggery with this game is: this is a hero-based game, like Overwatch or what have you.
However, when you buy the base version of the game, you get access to a total of **0** heroes.
A third of the roster can be unlocked with 15-20 hours of gameplay, but of course they are not the ""sexiest"" heroes. Those require 10, 15, 20 and 25 times what the basic heroes cost in in-game currency!

The rest of the roster can not reasonably be unlocked, even with hundreds of hours of play.

So if you buy the base version to dip a toe in and see if you like the game, well you need to spend upwards of a 90 dollars to get access to the rest, or hundreds upon hundreds of hours of gameplay. You CANNOT upgrade from the base version to any other version of the game that gives you more heroes.

Basically, they should have made the base version free-to-play with the current monetization scheme.
Always feels like shit to PAY for a game, and get NOTHING in content."

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,bick and dalls in my mouth hahah c0ck
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"Even on sale I cannot recommend against getting this hot mess enough. Even if you were willing to tolerate the absolute toxicity and immaturity of the community (If you see someone with a name that has swear words or just in general comes off obnoxious Immediately leave you are likely to get trolled and TKed), and no reporting does nothing Ubisoft does nothing whatsoever to police their community because this is the community, These are the people who enable ubisoft by spending hundreds on it.

Gameplay is a Mess as despite ubisoft advertising this as being about simulating a counter-terror unit and being tactical, the harsh reality is that your greatest enemy is your own team forgoing actual tactics in favor of trying to Get K/D ratio up to the point of Killing you if you by accident reaction shot A downed enemy they downed (No Im not kidding this really happened), or just having no shame whatsoever by screeching like a howling idiot and picking someone to teamkill (These people also usually main Shield heroes or Meta Picks, And have either lewd names or just foulmouth names or names with massive amounts of numbers).

While I can Accept that It is realistic that you get One Life and that's it, it feels weird to go for realism and then Make it so that you can still pick the same operator at the start of the round and nothing carries over from the previous round, It'd make it far more tactical to have the enemy have to use reinforcements lest they be out in the open from the previous round using New Defenders or facing New Attackers as they are locked out of the operators they used last round should they die. AND it'd make Vigil FAR less niche a pick for his gadget, As you'd have to be wary of the enemy using the previous round to sneak in hidden observation positions to use in the next round, Rainbow six CAN feel like a real Counter-terrorist operation at times but more often then not it is just a Peek-out.

Operators are irrelevant, It is a Sad Fact that the No Unique Recruit operator is fully capable of being capable of clutching the round, Because alot of Gadgets are INCREDIBLY niche (The Odds of Glance-Smart Glasses being useful is NIL, Because No one ever usually is in a situation where it'd help Especially because it has cooldown and cant be used on the move so it suffers from Glaz's Problems). Operators instead dictate weaponry, So the question is do you want Pure burst damage or Accurate but Low Rate of Fire, And Rate of Fire is king due to the Close quarters nature of almost every map.

If you are interested in rainbow six looking for the Die Hard experience or just to actually simulate breaching operations I'd recommend Swat 4 instead, It's a better game and quite frankly is enjoyable with friends or alone, and is more realistic and you wont have to worry about K/D obsessed trolls and such.

And To anyone who decides to play this anyways and encourage ubisoft's lack of regard beyond caving to the toxic community's whining about imbalance (Despite the fact they willfully ignore and never Complain about their own main's imbalanced acts, or try to make ubisoft patch out longstanding problems of the game):

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"after 400 hours of playing this game i would like the game, NO i want to kms"
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"If you enjoy gay sex or fapping to pictures of korean grandfathers then this is the game for you, follow me. Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like Dally
Pulled up, moped to the valley
Whitewalls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'mma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope
Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
God damn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella nineteen eighty seven
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together
You don't need a Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a Moped man
She got nineteen eighty eight Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player
Downtown, downtown (downtown)
Downtown, downtown (downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe
(Downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
(Downtown)
Of the leather seat between your legs
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Downtown
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get girl
Don't ever forget girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown
Dope
Cut the bullshit
Get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw
Moped like a bullet
You can't catch me
A po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
'Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out who that is?
It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I watch her skate
I mean, water ski, ollie ollie oxen free
I'm perusing down fourth and they watching me
I do a handstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, that ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, you need to slow down
Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit
Downtown, downtown (downtown)
Downtown, downtown
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
Of the leather seat between your legs
Downtown
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"Fuck this game, 2 days of suspension because the internet fucking cuts out in an UNRANKED MATCH. Fuck this game, it is actively trying to kill its fanbase, not worth the purchase."
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"This game is good but u will get bored of playing it alone, u need friends that actually trying to win and get ranked skill higher, I had friends that just tryed it and then went back to CSGO.. So I don't play it."

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"If you haven't played before and want to begin, don't even bother. Few games match this games toxicity and noob unfriendliness. When there hasn't been a new map in 3 years its obvious who they're pandering to."

"
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,"despite my hours this game is addicting but in a good way, I might never get tired of this game"
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,somehow you can play this over and over again and still not get bored of the same maps. one of the best games to kill time and have fun.
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,"FUn to play with friends but not fun to be the one who always dies first :’)

Motion sicknessss"
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,"This game never gets old, It's a great game the only downside is that you come across some toxic people every now and again but it's really fun especially with friends and it kills time as well, Highly recommend"
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,alright
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,Best with friends!
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,very fun classic valve game. still left 4 dead being left 4 dead.
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,i was going to unfriend any of my friends who had this game on their wishlist. its like the cheapest game in the market now. GET IT!
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550, good
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,"Oh boy, Left 4 Dead 2. What can I say? Oh yeah, I finally decided to spend money on this game. Last time I played it, which was years ago, let's say, I am not to proud of myself *cough (it was a pirated version)  

This game provides easily, the BEST online experience you can possibly imagine. Yes, you can play solo, but who in the world, want to kill zombies left and right, ALONE? This game is still alive and will remain alive. This game, is easily, top 5 or top 10 at most, best online game out there. The community, at least IN MY experience, is very laid back. People help you, take the game serious, while having fun at the same, no showboating, you get attacked, someone will have your back. You're dying, someone will rescue you, etc... This game is the true definition of team work. 

PS: still can't believe I once pirated this game. I missed out ALOT, but here I am trying to make up the time I lost. 

PS for the second time, add me, I am playing this game daily, and love making new friends who are willing to sacrifice his/herself and kill zombies."

Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,Left For Dead 2 It's a great game as well. What I like about its basically Mod For Dead 2 literally.  You can have modded skins for each character along with different voices and gun skins and healthpacks etc. You can also download different maps that the community made which is honestly so cool. Definitely recommend this game.

Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,"Very fun game. I started playing this when it came out in 2009 (such a long time ago!), on the Xbox 360 though. When building my own PC in 2012, I immediately bought Left 4 Dead 2 again. Beforehand, I watched a lot of YouTube videos in which people were playing the game with all kinds of mods installed. However, something that really stood out for me, were the custom campaigns. Some of these are fantastic still to this very day, one can argue that some of them are even better than the vanilla campaigns. Anyway, because of these aspects, combined with the obviously better control through keyboard and mouse, I couldn't wait to play the PC version. I don't play this game as often as I used to, but to me the game is still as fun as back in the day.  

First and foremost, great thing about this game is the fact, you don't necessarily need friends to play it. Sure, it's always extra fun to play something with a friend or two. However, it's really easy to join random people. Chances are you'll even make new steam friends that way. Obviously, you'll sometimes encounter people that are not entirely sure how to play the game. Although the game itself is reasonably straightforward, we're not talking about a particular complex game by any stretch of the imagination. Sadly, some so-called ""veteran"" / ""hardcore"" players usually won't miss a single chance to complain about ""newbies"" in threads on the forums of steam, in a manner which wouldn't look out of place when toddlers talk amongst themselves. Who, by the way, shouldn't be playing video games in the first place. Also, the forums on steam, as one might add without any hesistation, are increasingly becoming something similar to that of a cesspool catering towards screaming juveniles with too much free time on their hands. The same kind of people who mutter about ""PC masterrace"" or ""git gud"" during their monologues, but of course with the intelligence and mental stability of a 12-year old. Don't let yourself be discouraged though! The game is just a lot of fun, is cheap (during sales its price is ridiculously low) and the mod support is absolutely fantastic. You want to play L4D2 in anime style? Well, just take a look at the workshop. Of course, there are also a lot of your typical QoL mods. Best thing about this, they all come for free."
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,This game is the best its a must BUY!!!!!!:)
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,"SO MUCH FUN. If you have an old laptop or just not a gaming pc at all, it still runs well! I recommend playing this with friends too. It's fun on single player, but if you get a group of 4 people, endless fun. Amazing and funny mods too!"
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,This game is my life. I started to play on cracked version of the game when I don't have steam account actually (I was 12 years old). It's really really fun when you playing with friends (only players who don't rush and don't wastes medicals all time). Left 4 Dead 2 never gets old and never will be

Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,once you get the hang of it and realize your not good enough for expert its tons of fun.
Left 4 Dead 2,Action,550,"Eventhough the game has been a almost a decade old, it still is refreshing to play it every single day. Yes! I play it every day for 1 to 3 hours straight. The extra modded stuffs are great and the maps are unpredictable as I would meet new players every single day. I even make friends with some of them. I highly recommend this game for people who love zombie and coop games. This is the golden standard of coop games and there are many meme materials out of the gameplay too!"

Valve please make portal 3 its been 10 years."
Portal 2,Action,620,gumbo
Portal 2,Action,620,"This game has an amazing story that kept me so tied in that I would be caught playing for hours on end, and I enjoyed every second of it. It legitimately depresses me that no game will give me the same feeling that Portal has given me ever again. The entire atmosphere of this game makes you feel like you are alone, with incredible views and silence in most parts of the game, which I happen to love. When there are characters, they have lovable voices and personalities that keep you engaged to listen to their back and forth witty comments. The game play is of course, incredible. Even when I was stuck on some of the puzzles, the game managed to keep me fighting on and trying again. Valve has done a great job of using the materials they created to make new and exotic puzzles over and over again. If you read this review and want to see the game, please do not watch any game play or get spoiled in any way whatsoever. This is an experience you want to have on your own, and one you will miss when it is over. Thank you valve, for this masterpiece."

Portal 2,Action,620,"When the first and second one came out, it didn't appear to be a game I'd enjoy. This is the modern scenario of ""don't judge a book by its cover"" because I LOVE this game. Although my 5 year old is too young for it to play on his own, he LOVES to sit on my lap and watch me play. I REALLY wish they kept this series going. This is a puzzle game which is a switch up to my usual first person shooter style games which is why I thought I wouldn't like it but I was so wrong! LOVE this game!!

If you're reading this, I'd love to play Co-Op, message me!"

Portal 2,Action,620,"There are many reasons why portal 2 is my favorite video game ever made and in my opinion, the best game ever made. My first time being exposed to this game was when I got it on the Xbox 360 in 2015, and I wish it could have been sooner. I have comprised a short list on what key points about this game that I love and why I would recommend this game.

1. The story is absolutely phenomenal, it's pacing is great, funny when it's appropriate as well when being serious.
2. Although this game came out in 2011 it looks amazing when I go back to play it I always end up admiring every single test chamber and puzzle locations.
3. The music, oh my GOD the music in this game has such an amazing ""technologically lost in nature"" vibe that I just adore! Along with the fact that certain test elements have their own themes to them (i.e. standing near a companion cube plays it's theme) is astonishing.
4. The game mechanics are awesome! How momentum is handled in this game was done very well! Using the portal gun feels... I dunno just something about just makes me happy and appreciate this game along with how much love and effort Valve put into making this game!

In conclusion, if you're even reading this review random stranger browsing steam I 100% recommend this game and if I were to give any of my complaints? Only one I have is that I wish there was more to experience! And if anyone at Valve who worked on this game is reading this, thank you so much for making my childhood and all around gaming experience amazing with this game!

Now enough with my sappy love letter to this game, let's get testing!"
Portal 2,Action,620,CO-OP IS 10/10
Portal 2,Action,620,"8/10.

+ Great System Design.
+ Interesting Puzzles.
+ Godlike Optimization."
Portal 2,Action,620,;)
Portal 2,Action,620,"After bringing this alternate account to 314 gameplay hours, I decided it was time to leave a review.
This is a worthy sequel. --Mainly because it offers new test elements along with two-player, four-portal chambers and a puzzle editor.
GLaDOS is less funny but has more character.
Cave Johnson is fun.
Wheatley also has some good moments."
Portal 2,Action,620,"Amazing game. I played this game so much when I was younger. Mostly on Xbox with my friend, I get some sad nostalgia from it. Honestly give it an 8.9/10"

Portal 2,Action,620,"This game is about robots that are using portals to travel through time and space to KILL humans! The solo campaign gives you the perspective of the humans and your objective is to stop the robots, and the coop campaign gives you the perspective of the robots where you have to use a nuke to blow up a large portion of the remaining survivors. Overall, this game is pretty gory and has a lot of swearing. 10/10"

PAYDAY 2,Action,218620,"Payday 2 is well worth the money. The DLC, while adding what some may consider to be essential items, is not necessary to the amazing gameplay experience. If you truly want to get the most out of it, I would recommend either researching the proper DLC to buy or getting the legacy edition.

Payday 2 is also a very lenient game compared to most. If you don't want to buy the DLC, you ""could"" mod in items without the risk of being banned. The only penalty for this is being branded a cheater, but the game does not restrict you from using mods.

Overall, the game is well worth it, both for those seeking a shooting spree heist experience and for those wanting to slip away undetected. I would caution you from playing in random lobbies as they can be frustrating beyond all belief and opt for bringing a 1-3 fellow heisters to assist in your criminal endeavors."

PAYDAY 2,Action,218620,The best Racing Game I have ever played. Good Job 👍
PAYDAY 2,Action,218620,"I'll just say this now: I'm a bit on the fence on this one for only 1 reason, which I'll discuss later. I would recommend this on any other day, but this issue is a bit of a problem that cannot be remedied and will stick with it for the remainder of time.

Characters and Masks (The issue arrives): No affect on game play. How it should be. Some characters are more annoying depending on your preference, but this isn't a deal breaker. Masks allow for such a level of customization that you'll rarely see two people using the same mask (provided that they customized it to begin with). 

Weapons (The issue is quite noticeable here): There's a variety of what you can choose from, and in some cases: how much you can mod each weapon. It does seem weird how some guns have more varied options on how they can be modified where some others only have less than 10. But rest assured, there's a weapon for your play style (probably).

Skills and Perk decks (The issue hasn't left): With the massive number of skills available: you'll be able to make a build unique to you... or you can just copy a popular build you found, no one really cares. Perk decks are supposed to allow for more utility for your build. I say ""supposed to"" as the way they're designed is kinda weird. There's 9 ranks to a deck: 5 unique ranks and 4 copy/paste ranks that all decks share. I can understand that this was so that no deck would be without some required tech, but some don't offer much in uniqueness and some are underwhelming. 2 decks do almost the same thing, and 3 others are almost identical... why?? It's just a bit confusing.

Playing the game (guess what's back, the issue): You go into a heist, you do the thing, you leave and get payed. Your selection of available missions may seem small, but that's because it is. And here's where I'll mention the issue: this game is  8 years old, and has an 8 year old list of dlc to boot. The game is $10, all the dlc is +$140. Granted, you won't need all of it; but a large portion of weapons, characters/masks, perk decks, and heists are locked behind the dlc paywall. 14/66 dlc are either free or already in the base game, but you're still looking at funneling a large amount of money into this game. I'll admit that I own a good amount of the dlc packs, but that's only due to me actually enjoying the game [i] which is good! [/i] If someone else you're with has a dlc pack: you can join in no problem even if you don't [i] which is also good! [/i] I'll just end this part with: If you end up liking the game, there's no issue with buying some of the packs. But not all of them are worth the investment. RIP the Scarface character pack. [i] you will be missed [/i]

End Game: I'm not too impressed with the Infamous system. Burning all my spending cash, paying $200 million from my offshore account (it's a thing in the game, you'll learn about it), and resetting down to level 0... and I get 1 Infamy rank, a mask, ""perk tree discounts"", and a 5% increase to xp earned. I can understand that having actual gameplay altering mechanics would be ""unfair"" as rewards for the prestige mechanic, but if there's no PVP, then it doesn't matter as much. I don't feel like there's much of a reason to rank up my Infamy aside from ""clout"".

Overall: I can recommend this, but you will probably end up paying more than $10 for it."

Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"A future to No future Game.

once you play you really can't stop. I'm so fascinated with every single detail in this game. The art, the characters, the game play..  everything is in its perfect shape and place, despite being an 'old' game, it truly is a master piece and i can tell why people do have 10k+ hours in it. I've played some missions over and over again with different people, alone or some friends ( since i don't have many) and each experience was far away different from the first one just because those whom u play with are different. i got it yesterday and i was like okay lemme just see what I've got. ended up playing 10 hours straight.."
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"+ Great story
+ Tons of weapons/items that divided into 9 ranks of rarity. At first you'll just see a normal gun that just shoots normal bullets because you can't get legendary gun (orange) or higher rarity gun yet. Once you can obtain legendary or higher rarity gun, you'll start to see more unique weapon with unique stats/abilities/effects...
+ 6 Character classes to choose, with their own unique skills and abilities that make this game have high replayability value.
+ Great game to play with friends
+ Lot of side quest and challenges

"
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"This game has been one that I have dreaded playing for a long time... While I had heard that the game was amazing and a true masterpiece of the FPS RPG Genre I must admit that the artstyle was something that left a sour taste in my mouth as the visuals were particularly not my favourite. However I lost a bet with a friend years ago and he told me that as compensation I had to buy this game and one day do a runthrough with him to truly see what a masterpiece this game was, so I purchased it but still hadn't played it for some time. Then my roommate saw that I owned it and asked if he could use my Steam to play it on my PC every so often, even bought all the DLC shortly afterwards (minus the Commander Lilith DLC that leads into Borderlands 3 which i still have yet to obtain) just so he could play it not far from me while I was chilling on my Playstation or Xbox... And the jokes about this game, all over my facebook and all over my youtube for years even to the point that friends of mine made references to this game in D&D games that I was the Dungeon Master for... It seemed I could not escape my fate from this game, and so finally... as of about 8 days ago... I bit the bullet, got three of my mates, one who hadn't played before either and two that had, and we finally did a runthrough...

Now of my 104 hours that the review says I will admit that about 60 of them are actually mine, and the artstyle still annoys the hell out of me to this day BUT the rest of the game? Well it more than makes up for the artstyle's aggravation as this game is fun, hilarious and just left me with too many moments of joy, laughter and WTF episodes and my only regret is that in all honesty I should have played this sooner... I should have been shooting skag's in the mouth just as I left Highschool, I should have been beating down Psycho Midgets well before I moved towns and I sure as hell should have been cracking Handsome Jack's smug skull in WELL BEFORE I started university... But alas my stubbornness and that deplorable artstyle truly got in the way of this otherwise gem in the rough.

So thank you friend of mine for making that bet with me and forcing me to give it an honest go, for the hilarious moments were truly great, thank you players of my games for making references from well written lines and characters from this fantastic game, thank you best friends for joining me on this great crusade through Pandora and helping me to see the fun, thank you 2K for getting this game to all the boys and girls who really wanna smash Psycho's in the wasteland and thank you Gearbox and their staff members for taking the time to make this game as amazing and enjoyable as it is (minus the artists, i'm sorry but I cannot give you any praise as I can never personally forgive the style personally).

Now if you'll excuse me... I'm probably going to sink another 100 hours into this game at the very least and even play all the other sequels, prequels and predecessors with my friends to make up for lost time.

Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"Waiting for steam summer sale to buy that last DLC for this game, so I decided to take a break from borderland 2 to play LRFF and a few other games. While waiting I decided to finish my review for this game first.

Some of the best games in my library I didn’t play yet because I am still missing DLC like Dishonored or Stellaris as I always want to try to get the full experience of a game before I move onto other backlogs in my libraries. Borderlands 2 has been burning a hole on my playlist for a long time because of missing DLCs. A lot friend told me to play with them for many years but without getting the DLC it just feels weird for me. 

Being released for a long time this game is still in very good Quality. Great map design, Story, funny dialogue with awesome voice acting and the little madness in everybody. The interface and gameplay itself are still high standard in today’s game world. Difficulty is a bit higher then needed as game is expected to be play with a bunch of friends. I recommend explore each map and do missions that’s at least 2 level below yours and keep it that way so you don’t have to die too much. 

Lucky for us there is skeleton chest that you can open with golden key you can find by searching internet. Upgrade your guns using that every 4-5 levels or so using it so you don’t have to depend on quest reward and loot drops. Currently there are about 230 keys still available to grab before they expire and they do release more from time to time.

I was unlucky enough that play through the entire game + 3 major DLC not a single legendary dropped for me but normal people does have better luck than I do. Ouch, I am going to go cry in a corner now and let’s finish this review quickly.

9.5/10 would be my final score for this game as a whole and once I have the last DLC I will play through the game again in new game+ and the other 3 major DLC that I haven’t touched yet. Recommend for anyone and everyone, if you haven’t play this get all expansion on a sale and play now, you need to know the entire Borderlands story as the whole series is going very strong and new games and new expansions are being made constantly. Adding Borderland 3 + all DLCs into my Wishlist right now.

The looter shooter that got me into the Borderlands universe. Among the witty one-liners, unique humor, intriguing story, and deep characters is some rather addictive gameplay. You can shoot bad guys. You can shoot your friends. You can shoot a gun that shoots guns that shoot your friends. Or bad guys. Sometimes the bad guys shoot each other. Sometimes the good guys shoot each other. The most handsome guy in the game is a bad guy. The most annoying character in the game is a good guy. There's a gun that screams. Like, vocal screaming. There are dudes that just scream in general. You can have all this just cause you feel like it.

Arguably the best entry to the Borderlands universe.

===[ $ Price Index: ]===
☑ Worth even MORE than full price
☐ Completely worth full price
☐ Wait for a sale
☐ Be prepared to refund this title
☐ No Man's Sky (Do not ever purchase this abomination to the gaming industry)

I frequently see this game on sale for like $5. Every time I see it on sale for that cheap, I literally look for people on my friends list to buy the game for (disclaimer: go away). That's how enjoyable the game is.

===[ ۞ Playtime/Replayability: ]===
☑ Highly replayable (> 250 hours)
☐ Long (100 ~ 250 hours)
☐ Average (50 ~ 100 hours)
☐ Short (10 ~ 50 hours)
☐ Minuscule (0 ~ 10 hours)

Do not mistake my Steam time for how replayable this game is. I have probably clocked hundreds, if not thousands of hours on just Borderlands 2 alone on the Xbox 360 for how fun it is to play with friends.

===[ ☀ Story: ] ===
☐ Masterpiece
☑ Memorable
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ None

In this age of kind of crappy storytelling, Gearbox can still deliver games with very engaging stories without sacrificing gameplay quality. That seems to be a rare commodity nowadays. You'll meet some recurring characters from the original Borderlands as well as brand new characters. To me, there isn't a single character where I'd rather not see them in the game. Each character is very well written, and they blend together to form one of the most interesting stories in modern entertainment. The only reason the story doesn't earn a Masterpiece rating from me is because it is a bit cliche. Good guys defeat bad guy and save the world. The path that the good guys take to defeat the bad guy is what's very engaging.

===[ ☼ Visuals/Graphics: ]===
☐ Masterpiece
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ Visual catastrophe
☐ Ask M. Night Shyamalan to make a movie of it

For a 2012 game, it still looks fantastic. Some of the animations definitely look outdated, but most of the time, you're paying attention to the plot more than anything so there's a good chance you'll miss the weird-ish animations.

===[ ♬ Sounds/Music: ]===
☐ Masterpiece (Beethoven is smiling in his grave)
☑ Memorable
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ Do not put your ears through this terror

The music is pretty good. There are little jingles and tunes here and there that you'll likely remember for a long time. The overall sound design is great quality, but doesn't exactly stand out against other games like NieR:Automata.

===[ ☣ Hardware Requirements: ]===
☐ A stone tablet should be able to run it
☐ Minimum
☑ Average
☐ High End
☐ Quantum Computing may not be enough

For some reason, my RTX 2080 Super is ""running out of video memory"" once or twice per session. That definitely has me raising an eyebrow, but the game runs flawlessly otherwise.

===[ § Bugs: ]===
☐ None to report
☑ Some, but still completely playable
☐ Several annoying bugs
☐ Unplayable

Generally the game runs as you would expect, but you'll also run into moments where you're like ""wtf just happened?"". If anything, these ""wtf"" moments add comedic value to the game which already has loads of comedic value.

===[ ❤ Audience: ]===
☐ Fetus (> 0)
☐ Toddlers (> 1)
☐ Children (> 4)
☑ Teenagers (> 13)
☑ Adults (> 18)
☑ Casual players
☐ Pro players

===[ ☼ Skill Level: ]===
☐ Better make this your day job
☐ Sweaty neckbeards galore
☑ Requires some effort
☐ Minuscule effort
☐ Just look at the screen and you win

===[ ✦ Miscellaneous: ]===
Gearbox maintains their own small social network that's tied to the Borderlands games, so you will have to make a SHiFT account to play any Borderlands game. You won't have to download any clients or anything; Gearbox did a pretty good job integrating the SHiFT service into their games.

Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"[h1]Best FPS game I've ever played![/h1]

The story is fun & enjoyable. Love the characters & personalities, the jokes, and stunning scenery of post-apocalyptic & steampunk combined. There are a lot of interesting quests like: you massacre every enemies or find treasures. The main characters are just awesome! They have different skills (don't forget the costumes!) so you can choose whatever character's skill do you like. I really like the weapons design, it's like every weapon is one of a kind.

Although the game was good, it has flaws. I [b]REALLY HATE[/b] the timed quest. I want to enjoy the game not speedrunning it. And the reward.. well.. not worth it.. I can't play co-op too, maybe because of the internet connection...

This game is awesome. Though old, but it still fun to play solo or with friends and has replay value. Buy the DLC too, it's worth it!

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,i simp for mommi moxxi
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"In spite of my overall recommended rating, there are some things that you should probably know about this game.
Firstly is the mechanism of the ""looter shooter"" part of the game. In order to actually farm for weapons and items, you have to re-enter a level from the main menu every single time; there is no boss respawn mechanic in levels, which makes this necessary part of the game sometimes incredibly frustrating. This is especially so when trying to get legendary loot.
There are mods (custom launchers) that fix this issue, but I shouldn't have to download a launcher - why isn't this part of the base game? It's a looter-shooter, how did they not expect people to need to farm the same boss or bosses over again? Thankfully for me, load times are amongst the shortest I've seen, but I know that will not be the case for everyone, which may make the experience even more gruelling. 

Another problem so far has been co-op play. The entirety of the way, I've been playing this with 3 other friends, which has made the experience considerably more difficult. How strange, given that this IS meant to be a co-op game. We frequently find ourselves underleveled for areas simply because playing in co-op splits the experience but doesn't adjust for 4 players. This sort of issue doesn't happen in singleplayer. Ironic.

My third and final gripe is the zer0 Sniper class, who I've been focusing on this entire time. I would briefly like to point out the stupidity of having a melee branch with no genuine melee weapons - asides from that, the Sniper class can feel quite redundant at times. Critical hitboxes are both small and in sometimes ridiculous places, or are totally not existent at all - and even when shot, do not crit properly. Many engagements are in close quarters, and when playing with 4 people, ""getting hurt"" animations can increase the difficulty in landing headshots.
I get this is going to be partially out of my own aim, but all the other factors can sometimes make Sniper Zer0 feel like a chore. 

As for the positives of this game...
+ The gunplay CAN feel amazing
+ There's an incredible addictiveness to getting good loot
+ Landing headshots CAN be satisfying
+ The game looks awesome even on the worst settings

So overall, I recommend it. Is it worth $20? Debatable, but I bought it only sale (only about $7) and I would say I'm satisfied with my purchase so far. I think fundamentally some of the game's design choices turned out to be poor, especially with so much DLC and the issues mentioned above; every game has it's flaws. 

In spite of those things, it is probably worth a try.

Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"This game may have came out all the way back on the 18th September 2012 but that doesn't mean that nearly 9 years later that this game isn't still a all time favourite of mine and it should be a favourite of yours as well, this game may seem very basic to a new player, with the normal looter shooter mechanics but once you have played it for a while you start to under stand the mechanics of the game and slowly over time you'll start to know what to do early game, mid game and late game for farming gear, killing bosses and even speeding running parts of the game or even the whole game if you have played it enough. Once you feel burnt out of the game and you feel like you've played very bit of content this nearly 9 year old game has to offer, there are mods that you can play around with to make the experience totally different in many ways that make it unique every time you play."
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"Borderlands 2 is my favorite game in the Borderlands series. Playing this originally when it came out on console to re-visiting the game with my close friends on Steam I can say through multiple classes, playthroughs, humor, and multiple other things, Borderlands 2 is the best in the series.

One thing that I put into my Borderlands 3 review is that the series really changed after this entry (or potentially The Pre-Sequel depending on how you look at it) and so many bad decisions were made. Borderlands 2 was definitely the peak of the series and I truly hope Gearbox can come back to what made 2 so special with gameplay, UI, humor, and more."

Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"I don't know how to feel about this game, I've played it for 5 years and it took me till 2 years ago to realize I actually liked it. I spent like 3 years just playing through the tutorial area every once in a while as the same character.

Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"So, the game is very fun in terms of play and humor, also a big aspect of this game is that you can play coop up to 4 people so you can really have fun. There are many references to other games such as minecraft or doom. The texts that have been added to the game can also make a person smile. I really respect that they made a fun and playable game. I recommend it to anyone who likes to have fun"
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"I like how the weapons can be situational

Bandit: good for bossfights, especially their shotguns

Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"funni
"
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"so, Would i recommend bl2? Yes, but, there's a single big problem currently which is why im giving it a thumbs down. 

The Final DLC: The Fight for Sanctuary DLC now costs money, on release it was free, but its now the most expensive piece of DLC, that wouldn't be a problem if it didn't increase the level cap by two, which, normally would be fine except it also increased the OP level cap as well, and, due to how OP levels work, you can not reach any OP level without owning the Fight for Sanctuary DLC. Which means two of the other DLCs, the vault hunter upgrades, the second of which was what added OP levels. That means that two other pieces of content you bought now no longer work unless you pay 15 more dollars at the time of writing. You are locked out of content you bought already with this DLC, and, to make sure my point is clear, the Vault Hunter Upgrades were the only DLCs to add level ups, the second of which is what added op levels. Most people consider the handsome jack collection base game now, which, is fair, however, that still means fight for sanctuary is a 15$ add-on you have to pay in addition to the collection. People are saying that its your fault for not grabbing it while its free, which is still a bad argument to make because it discourages people from buying the game, especially when they seemingly never put the last DLC on sale. Commander Lilith is also one of the shortest DLCs, and really doesn't connect BL2 to BL3. The only thing it explains is why sanctuary is gone in 3. It also cannonizes the telltale games series (I say canonize because i remember reading it sold poorly, so more so just kinda made some deaths in it canon, mainly scooter.) which is its on can of worms that i will not get into.

Gearbox needs to make Fight for Sanctuary free forever or put it in the handsome jack collection. BL2 is a game i love dearly, and I'd honestly buy it for the switch just because its a great game to me and i'd love being able to play it on there, but im extremely turned away from the ideal knowing it will cost me at least 25 bucks for it and to have the shortest DLC to access content i already bought with the handsome jack collection."

Hades,RPG,1145360,"After Playing Transistor and Bastion I understood that Supergiant games doesn't really follow the same formula of current game developers. They just make great games every time.

Gameplay is probably the most similar to Bastion of all Supergiant Games, crisp, responsive, fun, fast-paced, challenging (if you wish) and enjoyable.

Greek mythology is always interesting and the way it's implemented on character design, art, visuals, the history and its replayability, is brilliant. 
Character Design in Hades is so sick and probably the strongest point of the game, the re-imagination of Greek Gods in this cartoony/anime art style is so well done and I could fall in love with every character.

Voice acting is always really strong in Supergiant, I remember reading in an AMA that it took them three years to record 1 million lines of dialog, that just shows how much work and love they put in their games. The game is almost fully voice acted and it's incredible.

OST is [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFVjtvuVHpE] fucking amazing [/url] it remind me a lot of DOOM ost but its clearly different and lets you get absorbed by the atmosphere of the game, I would get hooked in a zone for the music alone.

Hades is fucking great and fun and challenging and it has everything you would want in a roguelike."
Hades,RPG,1145360,"[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

Hades is a masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it receives. Play it. Even if you think you are not into action roguelikes or Greek mythology, the game is still worth trying out for the sake of an authentic experience. And if you are, well, there is a big chance it might become your favorite.

[h1]Full Review[/h1]

Let me start from afar. Video games as a medium are a way to escape unpleasant or uneventful everyday life. It is escapism, a necessary psychological device to divert thoughts from sadness, loss, or boredom. You can see it in every type of entertainment humans have, not merely video games. Likewise, roguelikes have deep roots in literal “escape” concerning their narrative (the hero always tries to escape a dungeon or labyrinth of sorts or even their fate). We might call it double escapism. At the same time, stories in most roguelikes only distantly resemble real-life situations. That is where Supergiant makes a difference. They not only create an addictive game with exceptional style and music, but they also tell a deeply allegorical coming-of-age story. You know, the type of story every one of us lives through at some point because there are no ideal families, as well as relationships. Maybe some will not see it like that, but this allegory penetrates every aspect of Hades. It returns you from the whimsical world (or should I say Underworld?) to your everyday life with new feelings, thoughts, and a desire to sort everything through. That is the highest praise I could imagine for an entertainment medium.

Hades follows the story of a young godling Zagreus, or Zag for short, and his relationship with his tyrant father, Hades, the god of the Underworld himself. Hades (the god) demands from his son, whom he scornfully calls “boy,” to be responsible, respectful, and obedient. At the same time, he is reluctant to show his love or appreciation. For Zag, there is only one way to deal with it: running away to relatives on Olympus. The problem, though, is that no one can escape the Underworld, even a godling! And so we start our desperate journey as Zag, trying to leave the domain of the dead. The story goes deep; its narration threads through many dialogs with different characters, intertwined between escape attempts into one whole piece. Slowly, the perspective shifts: the initial father-son conflict reveals underlying problems and broader themes. My favorite includes exercising honesty and outspokenness and why it is not always the best course of action in a manifold family to tell everything head-on. I love Greek mythology and Ancient Greek literature, and I must admit the level of detail is brilliant. There are many myths from different sources; Supergiant chooses its interpretations very carefully, so the story feels consistent. It is worth noting that they had a certain degree of freedom regarding the protagonist and his relations with everyone due to his minor significance in Greek mythology. Even there, though, in late interactions with Dionysus, we can learn an Easter egg about [spoiler]how the Orphic Dionysus Zagreus tradition has an internal explanation.[/spoiler] So, yeah, the immersion in the theme is truly brilliant, I mean it!

Gameplay-wise, Hades is as addictive as a perfect roguelike should be. You have to rely on your wit, reaction (sometimes even sense of rhythm), and, of course, luck to fight your way through the ever-changing environment with hundreds of possible adjustments to strategy and tactics. I could play games like Crypt of the NecroDancer or Dicey Dungeons in short sessions, but Hades? Nope. I play it, and play it, and play it. Again and again. It is so very addictive! Different weapons, boons, power-ups, and their combinations result in some weird and powerful twists to efficient tactics, which is an example of RNG done right. If you die, you can start again a bit stronger (if you gather enough Darkness, that is) through the process amusingly called Reflecting. Due to its core mechanics, the game can be frustrating, but that only means your character has not been powerful enough to beat something as of yet. Just play some more, and you will naturally overcome the obstacle. It starts to feel repetitive only when you finish the main story. At that point, the only way of raising the challenge is through the customizable Pact of Punishment, a plot device to make your post-story runs harder.

As always with Supergiant, the voice acting and music are exceptional. Beautiful melodies combined with heavier riffs and reverberations suit the game’s style and story greatly. And when Orpheus (Darren Korb, the composer) and Eurydice (Ashley Barrett) start singing, their verses seem to be out of this world. It is not a simple task to assume the roles of the legendary musician and his partner/muse and sing their parts convincingly. Somehow, Darren and Ashley pull it out! I literally had tears and goosebumps listening to In the Blood when the credits rolled. That was magnificent!

Lastly, I want to briefly mention the Fated List of Minor Prophecies which adds depth to the choice-making during escape attempts, and the detailed statistics menu for your runs. Little nuances like these contribute to the entire thing, making it much more enjoyable. And, well, there is also fishing. Because why not?"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hades has an [b] amazing story, [/b] with [b] fantastic storytelling. [/b] It also has an [b] excellent soundtrack and artstyle, [/b] [b] superb combat, [/b] and [b] great voice acting. [/b] 

In this game every death feels like a reward as you grow stronger. The progression, and character development is well thought out. The runs are unique because the chambers are always different, and you never know what you'll find. You can even alter the fate, and make your own boon combinations from the ground up, with the weapon you chose.
The combat is fluid and addicting. However, if you're here for the story, there is God Mode which gives damage reduction. 

Every other roguelike felt too grindy and boring for me, but this one is just different.
Hades is a [b] must play masterpiece. [/b] Really worth the price."
Hades,RPG,1145360,My fingers got numb after I played Hades the whole night. Now it's time to go to work and I didn't sleep yet. Only good things coming from this game so far (I can already see myself losing the job because of it)
Hades,RPG,1145360,I love this game so much and I can't stop talking/thinking about it. It's just amazing. I have only 35 hours on steam because my controller stopped working so I ended up buying it on the switch (I basically have about 75 hours at the time of this review) so I can play it because I couldn't not play it lmao. The art the music the story the voice acting the gameplay literally every aspect that you would expect from a good game and maybe even more. I'm just in shock by the amount of things you can do in this game and I think I'll continue to play it for a long time to come. Thank you for this Supergiant and thank you Jen for the amazing art you're an inspiration!
Hades,RPG,1145360,"great game, must play for voice actors tbh"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hm
Hades
Yes
Buy"
Hades,RPG,1145360,hades
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hades is a rougelike game that actually incorporates the concept of ""doing runs over and over"" in a way that makes sense into it's story. You're not just doing this because its a videogame, rather because in the context of the game its an actual mechanic and a ""normal behavior"".
In this game you will likely die in early chambers when you begin, but this is pretty much on par to how the game is designed, as you play more you will not only get better at handling Zagreus and learn enemy patterns, but also collect resources to make future runs easier, as you'll be able to permanently upgrade yourself, making future attempts more likely to succeed.
The main powers you acquire are derived from Olympian gods, each offering their own set of effects that you can equip to your main moves, or just gain passive buffs that might alter how you approach a given run, there's also 6 different weapons that can later even gain new alterations, even though the game encourages you to try all weapons by buffing the rewards you earn if you use a specific one during your next run, you might just find your favorite one and use it to achieve more victories.
The game also has a wide cast of charming characters that you'll be able to interact with during and before/after a run, deepening your relationship with each as you progress and eventually even unlocking sub stories related to them, allowing them to grow more as characters and friends of yours.
Overall this game is a great experience, and from popular word, even if you're unfamiliar with the rougelike genre, this game has proven to find their way to be liked by these people. There is a lot of extra unlockables you can pursue if you decide to, and the game even allows you to pump up the difficulty with set modifiers, to test the skill of those seeking for a greater challenge.
The true GOTY of 2020."
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Bought because it keeps appearing in front of my face! Got to say that is my best decision ever! Never going to regret buying the game, I dont usually play these kind of games, but Hades keeps me interested."

Hades,RPG,1145360,"A stroke of pure genius. The graphics are beautiful, the voice acting is amazing, and the music is overwhelming. The rogue-like concept is incorporated in such an amazing fashion that makes me love it, although I usually dislike rogue-likes.

Good story-telling, game design, and an incredible replayability. I have rarely played another game 50+ hours after getting all achievements.

Hats off, Supergiant!"
Hades,RPG,1145360,Game of the year 2020
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Amazing artwork, interesting story, and so many different combinations of skills and challenges that no two runs will be the same. One of the best rogue-lite games I've played."
Hades,RPG,1145360,"I almost committed one of the biggest crimes in gaming history: forgot to give this masterpiece a proper positive review after I've done playing it for over a hundred hours. So yeah, that's how good this game is."
Hades,RPG,1145360,its ok
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hades is a rogue-lite action game, where you gain control over Zagreus, son of Hades, in his multiple attempts of escaping the god of the dead’s domain.

Every run in the game is randomly generated – rooms, rewards, shop items etc. The main system of building a character lies in getting so called boons from various Olympian gods. Zag has a number of slots – like weapon’s main attack, cast and others, as well as unlimited pool for various passives, like enhanced moving speed or an ability to dash more times in a row. The boons from every specific god offer a variety of different bonuses (apart from enhancing overall damage of an action connected to specific slot) and specialize in some unique quirk. For example, most of Poseidon’s boons apply knock-away effects as well as bonus damage to bosses. There are also some permanent upgrades, for both the character (for example the number of revives for the run or the starting gold coins for shop items) and the main hub (most of them are cosmetic though), that can be bought with two special currencies respectively, that are accumulated over the runs.

The game offers 6 weapons to choose from for the particular run, and four so called aspects for every one of them, that adds a unique set of advantages and drawbacks, like decreasing max health but allowing to heal yourself by using one of the weapon’s special attacks. You can also choose one of the special items, acquired by interacting with characters in the game (gifting them the special item – ambrosia), that have different effects like bonus speed for clearing rooms fast or chance of getting health items for breaking down vases scattered on the levels. The only problem is the balance of the weapons, some are drastically worse than the others (yes, spear, I am looking at you).

While the main story is rather primitive, the side stories and the dialogues with characters, especially the gods, are simply wonderful. There are tons of dialogue lines, every one of which is fully voiced, and voiced perfectly, ideally showing the personality of every character.

The music is, as always, just beautiful, Darren Korb did an excellent job at designing all of it, utilizing even more assets at his hands this time, everything is just perfect.

The visuals offer nothing spectacular, but they are cartoonishly nice and cute.

Overall, it is another solid title from Supergiant Games. The gameplay is fun and satisfying. The story is okay, the characters and their voice acting are wonderful. The game might be a little too simple for a rogue-likish experience, but still is very enjoyable and memorable experience. Would definitely recommend it."
Hades,RPG,1145360,lmao easily goty 2020
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Usually, I'm not a rogue-like guy (I hate having to restart).
Usually, I very (very) rarely play a single-player game more than ~20h.
Usually...

Well this game is nothing usual and got me for 80h and counting ! 
I even reached 100% achievements without getting bored/annoyed a single time.

I knew SuperGiant Games were amazing but this one.. Oh my!  Story, characters, combat, songs(!!)... it checks all the boxes :o 

I only regret having bought it during sales, it clearly deserves to be bought at full price !

(Ok, I wish there was a coop/multiplayer option but hey, can't have it all :p )"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Roguelike-light are my favorite genre, so you can say I'm bribed.
But boy, something about this game is different - the combination of the different boons makes you feel like you're playing an entire different game each run, the story keeps you going and sets you a goal, the artstyle is flawless as well as the music and voice acting.
In fact, the only downside to this game is that there isn't enough of it."
Hades,RPG,1145360,"If you like action-based roguelites, this is a no-brainer choice imho.

Fantastic game. The music, design, art, game mechanics, progression are all top notch. The developers seem to be listening while still not compromising their vision. Can't speak good enough of this game."

[i]I'm very happy for Supergiant Games. After two games which were good but critically underrated (forget about ""Pyre"" from 2017 for a minute), they finally manage to break their ceiling and gain a wide amount of attention for all the right reasons. Hades is a fantastic game. I'm usually easily frustrated by rogue-likes but Hades eased me into it. Art design has always been top notch since Transistor, the story is incredibly wholesome and the music... oh my god the freaking music. I bow down to everyone who has worked on this game - you did a fantastic job and the love, time and effort you put into this seriously paid off.

There is nothing I dislike about Hades. Sounds like a lie, I know. Sure, it can be frustrating to be unable to defeat certain bosses when you start fresh. But just keep at it and you will be rewarded. 30 runs later you're a killing machine. Another 20 runs, you know how to speedrun your escape. No matter how long I kept playing, there was always something else that kept me going. Whether it was the increasing difficulty, the engaging subplots, the excellent characters, the wholesome family story or simply the tight and satisfying combat. After each run I kept telling myself ""Alright, one final run."" and I ended up escaping six more times instead. After 100 runs and 120 hours invested I can state, with absolute confidence, that Hades is an outstanding game, respectful of your time, money and skill. Blood and darkness, it is a blasted masterpiece.[/i]"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"If Bastion and The Binding of Isaac had a child, Hades would be it. It's a roguelike that leans heavily off of Bastion's isometric camera angle, art style, and assets (virtually all the weapons in Hades are ripped or heavily inspired by ones in Bastion), while taking aspects from Isaac's dungeon-based replayablity, enemy generation & gameplay mechanics (randomized upgrades, deals with the devil, etc.). Spoilers below, so TLDR: Hades isn't perfect, having some imbalance problems and a somewhat hard-to-relate-to main storyline, but it's worldbuilding, visuals & mythos are top notch, and it's shortcomings aren't nearly enough to hold it back from being a great game.

Firstly, Hades looks and sounds great. It's visually distinct art style is incredible, with Elysium and Chaos' Domain being my two favourite areas. It's Greek-inspired mythology is present in every aspect of the game, from it's backgrounds to it's characters, and you really get the impression the devs put a lot of time into doing their homework and making everyone look visually distinct and generally lore-friendly. Indeed, most of the characters in this game have unique personalities, with just enough flaws to make them relatable, but enough of a ""larger than life"" presence to make them feel godly. It's hard not growing attached to most of them (Artemis and Chaos are my two favourite characters), even though there are a few uninteresting ones that fall far into the background.

In regards to the story, it's a bit... meh. Teenage rebellion and tragic miscommunication don't jive well with me, considering the latter's a bit lazy writing-wise, and the former has long since been irrelevant in my life. In short, your a godly teenager running away from his estranged father, battling his way through the Greek underworld towards the surface, to find his Mother who left long ago. The reasonings for that last part start out decently, but to me became less and less believable the more it was explained. Frankly, I didn't really believe that there'd be this big war because of your Mother's rediscovery, not when every one of the gods seems well inclined to help you, and indeed some discover things for themselves before the true finale comes about, and still don't care. Again, tragic miscommunication plays a big part in this, and it feels lazy when the world actively doesn't reflect the supposed dire implications of your repeated escape attempts.

With all that said, the smaller moment-to-moment encounters with the gods (and other minor players) felt much more enjoyable to go through. The gods all have unique interactions both with the player and one another, and there's a pleasant, direct interaction with your quest and some of the world's characters. For example, some characters who dislike/distrust you may end up warming up to you the longer you play. Having a high relationship with some characters unlocks joint quests between them and a partner, again rewarding the player for playing more and actively seeking to increase their relationship with others. All in all, this aspect of the game I find much more appealing than the main storyline.

So, this leads us to gameplay. It's a rogue-like, so one's enjoyment can flip-flop depending on the RNG of items and upgrades. But in short, the game divides itself into two parts: upgrades for a specific run, and upgrades you can use to improved weapons/infrastructure for all future runs:
Regarding the former, Hades differs from Isaac in that there aren't very many run-defining items you can find throughout the game. Specifically, finding Ipecac or Brimstone in Isaac could be enough to carry a run based off that one item alone, however Hades has no items of this significance. Don't get me wrong, there are some exceptionally strong items and boons available, but none of them will win you the game by themselves. This is both a blessing and a curse: it ensures that even strong runs aren't always guaranteed wins, but also means that if you're behind in terms of damage and/or survivability, you'll need multiple good items to catch back up, which in some cases simply doesn't happen
Regarding the latter, some aspects are good, while others are a bit lackluster. Keys needed to unlock character upgrades can become useless even before completing your first full run, gemstones are much better spent on item & resource upgrades, rather than useless cosmetic base-building ones. I really like the idea of trinkets giving you specific god buff encounters, but I wish they carried over along multiple zones (ex. I really like Artemis and her damage-focused upgrades, but these can be a little lackluster if you don't get multiple successive buffs from her that complement each other, and god trinkets only provides one guaranteed item/encounter per run), and some trinkets are practically useless compared to others.

Some other things of note before wrapping up:
-I wish there was a trinket that guaranteed Daedalus Hammer upgrades... some weapons like the spear benefit greatly from it's triple dash attack upgrade, while ones like the boltcaster are pretty well wholly reliant on it's triple shot & unlimited ammo upgrades. These are the closest thing to single-run-defining upgrades in the game, and ironically, it's the only thing that has no guaranteed encounter trinket associated with it
-I wish some of the weapons were more balanced. Like for example, the spear is a godtier weapon (even without hammer upgrades), but the shield and boltcaster feel gimped & upgrade-reliant in comparison (despite the former securing me my first final boss victory with a weird laser crystal build)
-In general, having more damage is preferable to having more defence. Having both at once is obviously optimal, but if given the choice, having a lot of offence can help make up for having a lack of defence, while having a lot of defence isn't always enough to overcome a low offence (unless your buffs are so overwhelming that enemies are doing virtually no damage)
-And finally, I wish the game was a little more upfront in terms of how to improve relationships with others. 65 hours in and I still don't have some side characters' quests completed, nor do I know all the requirements for giving individual gods ambrosia for their final relationship hearts

In short, Hades is a visually & audibly fantastic game, with an incredibly attentive Greek mythos that feels like a well-thought-out and well-researched passion project. Most of it's characters are distinct and easily likable, even the ones with prickly temperaments. The main story falters a bit in terms of teenage angstiness and unnecessary tragic miscommunications, but more than makes up for it with it's myriad of significantly more interesting side stories, many of which directly evolve with the player as the progress throughout the game. Gameplay-wise, it's a rougelike with toned-down elements from Isaac; mostly good, but occasionally frustrating if you get unlucky with upgrades/boons, as there are no real run-defining upgrades to single-handedly pick a struggling player up.

To me, Hades feels like a return to Supergiant's roots, fitting back into that cozy familiarity of Bastion (in contrast to say Transistor, which largely deviated from Bastion's formula & success), while reminding me of the better moments from OG Isaac. I loved the mythos and characters of this game, and hope Supergiant continues along similar directions in the future.

Absolutely worth a recommendation."

Hades,RPG,1145360,"I LOVE this game. The music is superb and never gets old, the character design and voice acting is stellar and gritty. These are not Cartoon Network voice actors, these are David Attenborough, Mark Hamill, and Tim Curry level of great. The story is simple and streamlined, and these are a mountain of unique interactions and areas to explore. The dungeon crawler game-play is smooth and runs like a dream, with great affects and a rather deep level of game-play. If all if this weren't enough, the team behind this game is a group of wonderful people who first and foremost put QUALITY effort into their work as well as a lot of love. You can't go wrong with this title. Buy it, and support the developers for their stellar work, and play it until it falls apart!"

Hades,RPG,1145360,Fun and great music!
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Safe to say I completely love this game. A huge nod to Supergiant games for their efforts here. 

I'm not hugely experienced with Roguelites but I feel this one really is special. The lore and mythology, the gameplay and the gameplay loop, the character interactions and story - all these things came together so seamlessly for one of the most immersive experiences i've had. The voice acting and sheer level of wit/personality in the dialogue is outstanding, the story was heartwarming yet still filled with trials and tribulations, and the sound design and music added so much atmosphere and memorable moments, more than I can really count honestly. Visually for a 2D game, it's so detailed, vibrant and full of charm as a Supergiant game often is. Just have to add - Zagreus is one of the best leads in a game that I can possibly think of.

The gameplay/gameplay loop was really really addicting to me. I can see it not being for everyone but if you get through some runs of this game, you will not regret it as it gets better and better. It's meant to kick your ass early as a roguelite often does, but the rate of build up/rewards you get as you go along feels very good and there are many, many ways to play even in the similar confines of the games areas. As someone who loves ARPG's and theory, this game was perfect for experimenting with things and finding out what works and what doesn't.

Do try this game sometime, it's not a full price game and it really is a true gem. I may be overselling it but it's not often I feel this much excitement or passion about a game."
Hades,RPG,1145360,honestly should have been game of the year
Hades,RPG,1145360,"story good, gameplay fun, music fire"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"After Playing Transistor and Bastion I understood that Supergiant games doesn't really follow the same formula of current game developers. They just make great games every time.

Gameplay is probably the most similar to Bastion of all Supergiant Games, crisp, responsive, fun, fast-paced, challenging (if you wish) and enjoyable.

Greek mythology is always interesting and the way it's implemented on character design, art, visuals, the history and its replayability, is brilliant.
Character Design in Hades is so sick and probably the strongest point of the game, the re-imagination of Greek Gods in this cartoony/anime art style is so well done and I could fall in love with every character.

Voice acting is always really strong in Supergiant, I remember reading in an AMA that it took them three years to record 1 million lines of dialog, that just shows how much work and love they put in their games. The game is almost fully voice acted and it's incredible.

OST is amazing it remind me a lot of DOOM ost but its clearly different and lets you get absorbed by the atmosphere of the game, I would get hooked in a zone for the music alone.

Hades is  great and fun and challenging and it has everything you would want in a roguelike.

Also if you keep playing this game the story will keep deeper because it not fixed conversation it has like thousand of it so enjoy the game and keep play it for deeper detail."

Hades,RPG,1145360,"Absolutely in love with this game. It does not get boring AT ALL and it does require strategy and not just slamming things about. The story, the voice acting, the art - all phenomenal. As a huge fan of Bastion, I'm so glad this game is amazing too. And it's affordable!"

There are multitudes of playstyles you can try out with the weapon selection, and even more playstyles after that depending on which traits you pick up through your playthrough. Even after you beat the game, there's just so much to do and so much story and dialogue to unlock that I just never get sick of this game. It's fun to pick up and play even if you haven't touched it in a while, which attests to how intuitive and smooth the gameplay is. It's rewarding and lets you feel incredibly strong and skilled when you find great synergies, and there are so many traits to mess around and mix-and-match with that you'll want to go again and again to try it all out.

I think this game was a gateway drug into my newfound obsession with Greek mythology. All the gods and goddesses are, of course, heavily stylised, and the artwork is so beautiful and the voice-acting so incredibly good. There's a ton of dialogue, too, so you don't find yourself hearing the same thing even though you're encountering the same sets of bosses each run-through. The setting and story told lends itself so well to the roguelike nature of the game, so much so that it doesn't feel as crushing or frustrating when a run ends prematurely. Even after I ""beat"" the game (did a successful runthrough to the end, really) there was a ton of story left waiting.

Hades,RPG,1145360,"I'm not usually a rogue-like player but this game was incredibly easy to get into even for someone like me. The gameplay is fun and addictive, the narrative is solid and the music is excellent. Can't recommend enough!"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hades is fantastic. Prior to playing the game, I had no idea what kind of game it was or anything else about it -- I simply knew it was a good game. I bought it on a whim and tried it and, at first, was not fond of the fact there was no true tutorial. However, the more I played, the more I realized that your deaths were the tutorial. You are taught the game by the many deaths you face. It wouldn't be something I would like in other games, however, this one by far does it in an excellent way -- not to mention the pools of possible voice lines and scenarios for a specific death at a specific time. The game is very immersive and very fun overall and, if you already know some of Greek mythology, it will be a true experience to you."
Hades,RPG,1145360,"One of the best games I've ever played. You can tell that the amount of love put into this game by the devs is immense. Love the art style, characters, gameplay, and replayability of it. So much content and and so many characters to fall in love with. 
Can't recommend it enough."
Hades,RPG,1145360,"I'm a person who likes builds.  The more builds the better.  This game delivers so many build choices and skill synergies.  I feel like a scientist in a lab when I start a run.  But even better, the combat is damn near as good as dead cells.  And for no apparent reason it has a great story.  This is an instant classic and a must play."
Hades,RPG,1145360,Hades is the best rouge like/ dungeon crawler that I've ever played. it's brutal and fast pasted combat truly pushes you to your limits. Getting from dungeon to dungeon is based on skill and the creativity of how you use your arsenal of weapons. I have not beaten the game yet but I highly recommend it to anyone interested looking for an amazing fast paced and hectic dungeon crawler.
Hades,RPG,1145360,very good and fun. great music too

Hades,RPG,1145360,"At first I knew nothing about this game and was confused as to why it was a nominee for The Game Awards. After 100% it, I understand completely of the pedestal this game is held at. Amazing VA, gameplay, story, mechanics, and most importantly there is no bs overpriced dlc you have to by. A finished product! Hades was a game I never thought I would get so immersed and addicted to, and I don't regret a single second of it. I highly recommend buying this game and spreading the word. Supergiant did a terrific job with this game! :)"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"I don't think words can fully encompass the splendor of this work of art. A full story behind interesting character - seemingly endless new dialogue in 60+ hours of game-time. It boasts a rocking score to get your heart pumping as you tear the underworld asunder, coupled with magnificent riffs and the ability to still pull heartstrings when it needs to. A tight gameplay loop that will keep you enthralled, coupled with the works of the mighty story-teller that is Supergiant Games.

Oh, and its priced far cheaper than it has any right to be."
Hades,RPG,1145360,Cerberus best boi
Hades,RPG,1145360,"It is a really good game where in certain circumstances if you live or die, either way is fun. I would recommend it to pretty much everyone because I was doubtful at first but it's just a great game and you'll see why if you play for like 5 minutes. There is tons of story and upgrades you won't expect, I think i'm 40 hours in and only at half achievements. 5/5 stars."

Hades,RPG,1145360,Play it everyday.
Hades,RPG,1145360,"ever since i've started obsessively playing this game it's been wowing me. the graphics are stunning, the soundtrack & voice acting are spot on, and the take on greek mythology is so refreshing. it's altogether a very immersive & creative experience. i love how customizable it is and how no two runs are the same, and that dying actually makes it's way into the storyline.

all of the characters are super charming and lovable for different reasons. zagreus is an awesome protaganist, he manages to be a badass while also being extremely sweet and noble. and there's even romance options, which honestly, with zagreus being as likable as he is i'd be shocked if there weren't. (def romance thanatos trust me it is so worth it...)

anyways, one of my favorite games of all time. so much replay ability and it never gets old. it doesn't hold your hand, and there's always a new challenge if you feel like it's getting too easy. 10/10, so glad i bought this, well worth the money"

[i]~Castlevania II: Simon's Quest[/i][/h1]

Back in [b]2011[/b], [b]Techland[/b] (creators of the games like [b]Chrome[/b] and [b]Call of Juarez[/b]) released [b]Dead Island[/b]. A first-person open world game that tried to continue what [b]Deep Shadows[/b] (Ukrainian developer who, unfortunately, ended up making generic hidden objects games) tried to achieve for years in their [b]Xenus[/b] (AKA [b]Boiling Point[/b]) series. In other words, it was a first-person open world game, in which we were able to use cars to cover large distances. Except in [b]Techland[/b]'s game we also got... well, zombies. Which were [b]Dead Island[/b]'s selling point. See, aside from other things, [b]Dead Island[/b] tried to simulate zombie apocalypse. In a way, it was a survival game. Your character used to die easily, your supplies were limited and so on. It was a game, in which you were supposed to be [i]scared[/i] of your enemies.

Unfortunately, [b]Dead Island[/b] was far from being good enough. The story sucked pretty hard and it was obvious that [b]Techland[/b] didn't have enough power to fully bring their vision to life. It was one of those cases, in which developers tried to achieve too much. Instead of polishing single-player mode and adding some interesting quests, [b]Techland[/b] focuses on co-op and... well, like I said, the result was far from being good enough. And when the sequel came out, things got even worse. Just because single-player mode felt like a repetitive mess. An excuse. Sure, it was still somewhat fun in co-op, but... yeah...

Anyway, in [b]Dying Light[/b] we've got zombies again. With [b]Dead Island[/b] franchise being a property of [b]Deep Silver[/b], [b]Techland[/b] decided to start from scratch. Now under the different publisher. And yes, you can still clearly feel the [b]Dead Island[/b] here. Like [b]Dead Island[/b], [b]Dying Light[/b] is a first-person game that's taking place in an open-world environment. And like in [b]Dead Island[/b], we'll do some quests (most of which are optional), explore the world to get some materials, craft the equipment and so on. All while trying to survive zombie apocalypse. Like in [b]Dead Island[/b], it's pretty easy to die here (especially on high difficulties), your supplies are very limited and, of course, there's a co-op here.

Don't expect [b]Dying Light[/b] to be just [b]Dead Island[/b] clone, though. I can say a lot of bad things about [b]Techland[/b], but this time? This time they've played it fair and square. They didn't just give us more of exactly the same under the different publisher. They did try to think about what was wrong about their previous series and make something new. Something better. All while trying to avoid their previous mistakes. Did they succeed? Well... yes. And no. See, even though there's a lot of things done right in [b]Dying Light[/b], there's also a lot of things done wrong. Totally wrong.

First of all, the story sucks. Simple like that. I mean, even [b]Dead Island[/b] had a pretty bad story, but this? This is just ridiculous. Long story short, there's that [b]Rambo[/b]-like guy who's all cool and stuff (and no, you can't even choose the character this time), there's that girl who looks suspiciously like [b]Alyx[/b] from [b]Half-Life[/b] series, there are zombies and... that's pretty much it. Our [b]Rambo[/b] dude is running from [b]A[/b] to [b]B[/b], speaking with all sorts of nobodies (remember [b]Far Cry 2[/b]?) and care about the girl. Not only the story in this game is painfully boring and doesn't provide you with enough motivation to keep playing (very soon you'll stop caring and start skipping the cutscenes), it also feels surprisingly archaic. I mean, come on! This game was released back in [b]2015[/b]. And I'm pretty sure at that point we've all learned that girls can do more than just cooking and crying. Heck, even [b]Princess Peach[/b] used to kick some serious ass at that point. But no, [b]Techland[/b] just stuck in the past with some painfully old stereotypes. Which... I can technically swallow by itself, but combined with shallow characters and no interesting developments? It's a disaster.

Naturally, the quests are very repetitive too. Again, it makes me think of good old... OK, maybe not good, but still old [b]Far Cry 2[/b]. You'll just run from [b]A[/b] to [b]B[/b] again and again. Sure, I can see why [b]Techland[/b] tried to force us to run through the entire map (which isn't really that big, by the way) so often. The idea was to make us face the zombies more often. To make the survival part to have more impact. But with the pace being way too slow and the fact that, unlike [b]Dead Island[/b], there are no cars in this game... it just... doesn't feel good enough. Especially if you're playing alone. [b]Dying Light[/b] is way too slow and way too boring. Controls are also way too clunky. And since [b]Techland[/b] tried to add some parkour this time, the game feels a bit too rough here and there. Like I said, a lot of bad stuff here.

Thankfully, there's also a lot of good. First of all – do you remember [b]Castlevania II[/b]? An [b]NES[/b] title that a lot of people hated because of the poor English translation, but also the first one in the series to introduce us to what will later be called “[b]Metroidvania[/b]”? Remember how much the night mattered there? Well, that's what [b]Techland[/b] did in this game. The night in this game is dark. And full of terrors. You go outside at night? Your chances to survive will decrease drastically. On the other hand, if you feel confident and have a good weapon, a night may be a nice opportunity to level up. Because the amount of experience will double at night. In the end, the choice will be yours. Just keep in mind that the night matters.

There's also a lot of ways to avoid the enemies now too. Even though parkour in this game doesn't feel as good as it was supposed to, the fact that you can use the roofs to avoid fighting or take the advantage? It's pretty cool. Yes, it does make the game even slower, but... that's just the thing about this game. You don't like all of those slow-paced survival games? You won't like it here. Don't expect any [b]DOOM[/b]. This game wants you to experience the zombie apocalypse. For both good and bad.

Finally, like the [b]Dead Island[/b], this game wants you to play in co-op. And that's where the game begins to shine for real. Fighting through the hordes of zombies, while trying to survive the night? It's way, [i]way[/i] more fun with the friends. Personally, I found [b]Dying Light[/b] co-op to be way more fun than the one from the [b]Dead Island[/b]. So, if you have a bunch of [b]Walking Dead[/b] fans in your [b]Steam[/b] friendlist? Check this game out.

Anyway, what's in conclusion? In conclusion... I must say that I hate the rating system in [b]Steam[/b]. See, I can't fully recommend this game. Clunky parkour, painfully boring story, lack of interesting characters and other things like that? Hated 'em. If you're about to play alone? There's a big chance you'll find this game painfully boring and repetitive. And if you're going to pay for all the [b]DLC[/b]? You'll quickly regret your decision, since only one of them really matters for those who only play single player (I'm talking about [b]The Following[/b] expansion, of course). On the other hand, the co-op is pretty entertaining [i]and[/i] it's hard not to enjoy the night mechanics and the fact that we can use buildings to get the advantage. And as the result, I just don't... think I want to give this game a thumb down. Just because... even though I can't say I fully enjoyed it, it sure had its moments. So... yeah. Think about what you want from [b]Dying Light[/b] before buying it. You want a solid single-player experience? Then it's a no from me. You have friends to play in co-op? It may be worth it. Just make sure to ignore the [b]DLC[/b]. Dixi."
Dying Light,Action,239140,nice game. i love it
Dying Light,Action,239140,Good game. Fun and action packed.
Dying Light,Action,239140,"The game is beautiful. You literally get to kill zombies, while parkouring over their heads. The weapon and damage mechanism works like a charm, I just love the way your melee weapons slice open the zombies, and at times cut open them in half spilling out their guts. I am a gore fan but this game just takes it to another level, and then there is the best utility in the game - Have you ever wanted a Assassin's Creed game with zombies, this solves it lol. The grappling hook is just amazing.

Want to play with friends, no problem, this game has that covered aswell, the campaign of this game can be done with friends, you progress, they progress aswell, I enjoyed doing campaign with my friends on Nightmare mode, the toughest difficulty and it was an amazing experience. Plus there are side missions and challenges that will never fail to amaze your group. Also, there are these mini-missions that keep going on and on where you can test your mettle, play in a group of 2 or 4, compete and see who's the best survivor in this zombie era..

If you really want to spend some time killing zombies while parkouring, then this is the game for you, no weapon restrictions no nothing, just craft away anything that suits you and keep gathering resources, and the night will be easy to survive..

P.S. DLCs are amazing, The Following is my favourite as you get to drive vehicles and the vehicle modifications are just too good to be true.."
Dying Light,Action,239140,Parkour + zombies. What more could you ask for?
Dying Light,Action,239140,"If you have played games like COD or escape from Tarkov Or other games Like them, This would Be A Good Game For you"
Dying Light,Action,239140,"Love that the game kills you and you cant do anything about it AND IT TAKES YOUR FUCKING XP 
"
Dying Light,Action,239140,Drop kicking Zombies from the top of a roof is fun
Dying Light,Action,239140,"Solid Zombie, Great Co-op, Decent Story. Worth some money."
Dying Light,Action,239140,"I'm not sure if I would recommend this game to others. It's sad because the elements for a good game are all here, but it lacks some kind of polish that would pull the whole thing together. I don't dislike this game, and I plan on at least finishing the main storyline, but I have some problems with it that are hard to overlook and ultimately make the game unfun.

My first problem is the amount of effort actually required to engage with a single undead enemy. Even after 8 hours of playing the game, most enemies take at least 3 hits and most of your stamina bar to kill. Fighting 4 enemies at once is almost impossible. It's a better idea to distract them and escape. -- This is a parcour game disguised as a zombie game. The traps are unfun and impractical. The human enemies are practically immune to most throwing weapons and take a ton of damage to kill. Every single encounter with human enemies is a slog.

Most missions will have you running across the map to do something. There will be enemies in the way and the running and aiming the camera to escape can at times be disorienting. The gameplay loop is extremely monotonous and the variety of enemies makes the game more frustrating than fun, because the weakest enemies still take too much damage to kill. The stronger enemies are just damage sponges and not more fun to take care of.

The items that you find in the world for crafting are mostly the same, and the locations that you find them in are very predictible. It somehow gives the impressions that despite the size of the map the game is very small. It's easy to lose your place because of the repeated assets. You'll find yourself asking if you've ""already been in this building and the items just reappeared or something?""

Ultimately this game is fun to play as a complete timewaster. The story is fairly uncompelling and while some of the characters are fun they don't hold a candle to some of the more colorful types of people you can find in Fallout or something like that.

If you go into this game expecting an action experience you will be disappointed. What instead you will find is a parcour simulator, similar to something like an open world Mirror's Edge but with Zombies.

I'm reluctantly giving this game a thumbs down because I do think it has a lot to offer for some people, but for me I've been waiting for the moment that it ""gets good"" and it doesn't look like it's going to happen."

Dying Light,Action,239140,THE SECOND ONE IS FINALLY HERE BOYS AND GIRLS ITS FINALLY HERE AND I AM REALLY EXCITED TO PLAY IT AFTER HAVING TO WAIT SO LONG BUT NOW ITS ALMOST FINALLY HERE AND I HAVE NOT BEEN THIS HAPPY
Dying Light,Action,239140,"This game has a lot of potential, the overall run and survive feels very realistic and the mechanics are quite enjoyable. However, the game campaign is overall really infuriating. To balance big ""fights"" the game takes away your inventory and leaves the player with one weapon, instead of balancing their fights around weapons you have acquired, it takes them away. This game has a creation system that encourages you too build weapons. It is also a nuisance that the game is ""co-op"" for the majority of the game, except for the tutorial (which is fine because it allows the player to learn at his/her pace), and the final mission is also solo. So for me who plays survival games with friends, this was very annoying. Not to mention the entirety of the story was overwhelmingly unsatisfying with an even more unsatisfying ending. My recommendation don't buy this game full price."
Dying Light,Action,239140,"Kyle Crane, Harran'daki karantina incelemek için gönderilmediğini yalnız kalıp terk edildikten sonra anlıyor fakat bu hayatından veya Harran'daki insanların daha iyi bir yaşam sürmesini ve var olan dengesizliği değiştirmesini engellemeyecek. Bütün distopyalarda olduğu gibi hiçbir zaman insanların en büyük düşmanı çevredeki unsurlar değil, kötü niyetli insanlar oluyor. 

Crane, attığı her adımda ölümle karşı karşıya kalmasına, yanında sevdiği insanları kaybetmesine rağmen Harran'daki insanların var olan tehlikeye karşı en güçlü şekilde mücadele etmesine yardım edecek.

Ayrıca oyundaki onlarca yakın dövüş, ilkel veya patlayıcı silahlar oyuna çok büyük bir keyif veriyor. Sanki Borderlands 2 oynuyormuş gibi farklı özelliklere sahip farklı silahlar bulup zombilerle uğraştığınız kadar envanterinizle de uğraşıyorsunuz.

Oyunun ana hikayesi en az iki arkadaşla bile çok zevk verecek fakat DLC hikayesinin bile bu kadar keyifli olması ve Crane'in savaşmaya devam edip ana oyunda olmayan ekstra özelliklerle daha da eğleneceğiniz bir oyun süreci geçireceğinizi düşünüyorum.

Dying Light,Action,239140,"Fun when you play it with your friends, but still also fun when you got nothing to do as well!"
Dying Light,Action,239140,the game is really fun and challenging but if you get motion sick real easy it is difficult
Dying Light,Action,239140,"Dying Light. Wow. What is there to say? Maybe it's easier to say the things I didn't like.

1. I hate how I loved this game so much that buddy and me kept coming back because we couldn't get enough.

Dying Light 2, here I come!"
Dying Light,Action,239140,"Fun game, but DO NOT buy the platinum edition because it contains lots of overpowered weapon blueprints right from the get go which will ruin the flow of the progression system. Gave up this playthrough because the game become so boring when you can just one hit kill everything right from the start lmao."
Dying Light,Action,239140,"[END GAME]
[Spoilers]
Hours Total Across All Platforms: 1,944 Hours
1. 
- Story (Slums/OldTown)
If you're in it for the storymode, you won't be disappointed as the vast world gives off plenty of creative kills such as DropKick, Death From Above, Spike Kills you name it. The ending is as expected from a zombie game, a simple wasd and the boss is dead. But the overall gameplay is amazing if you're into parkour and intense survival ability.
2. 
- DLC [Downloadable Content]
The Following/The Countryside
A Huge open-world map that could be a game itself, has a whole new story and different people to meet.
Meeting the Mother, which she gives her people the power to stand in large groups in the infected unnoticed. Protecting all who follow her, and yes the ending has a much for involved fight than original.
Adds more unique weapons such as the Crossbow and unique guns into play [SMG for example]
The other smaller content for cheaper includes more melee weapons, crossbow skin(s) & story related unlocks such as HellRaid. Which has more to come I'm sure of it
3. The Real EndGame
- Be The Zombie
Whether you'd like to master the art of Hunting Survivors or prefer to destroy nests across your preferred map, this gamemode, without a doubt has been what's kept me around for so long. The experience you gain from meeting other players who enjoy the game as much as you is reward in itself as you can go up to 4 Survivors against 1 Night Hunter. The more humans you have in your lobby, the stronger the Hunter becomes. Regenerates Spits Faster, Increased Health, & a much Higher Stamina Pool. Don't let this fool you, with enough experience you can still hold your own.

Result:
If you're looking for a game that is long-term in terms of a community, we are all here & would love to have you. If you enjoy the casual experience of zombie-slaying, there's no harm in it. Community Bounties are always posted so you can do your part in PvE (Player Vs Enemy/AI) aswell. Thank you for reading my review, this was actually my first. Dying Light has changed my life drastically. Here comes Dying Light 2"
Dying Light,Action,239140,it is so fucking good
Dying Light,Action,239140,"Before you buy, i'll tell you something. From my experience this game will run on 20 - 15 Fps if you're using Gaming Laptop, i got 1660ti with Ryzen 7 3750H and 16gb ram, i already set the game on best performance and this game gave me 20 - 15 Fps (sometime drop to 5 - 7 Fps) kinda ridiculous but this game really have poor performance on Laptop

And review for the game, well..... the game story is almost bad for me (Like why you even risking your life looking for a file that you didn't know anything about it??? it's really strange for me thought) BUT! the gameplay on this game is really fun, starting from the parkour (Dropkicking zombie) , weapon (there's King Arthur weapon), zombie (F YOU VOLATILE!!!), challenge and the easter egg (did you know if there's a Harry Potter's house on this game?), all of that is overwhelmingly good and 1 more thing, you can co op on this game with your friend (if you have one)

Overall, this game is really fun to play especially if you have a friend to play with and..... i'm gonna give this 8/10

Cheers!"
Dying Light,Action,239140,"I am not usually interested in singleplayer story games. I have found a few that I like, but my primary enjoyment in gaming comes from playing with friends. The coop feature of this game works near flawlessly, and I was able to immerse myself in the story while still retaining the ability to mess around with friends. 

I would highly recommend this game. The story I found quite well done, and the quests were challenging but not impossible. I did not find the game incredibly repetitive, and found the grind to actually be pretty fun. 

If you have played games similar to this I think you would definetly enjoy it. If you enjoy playing with friends, I think you would enjoy this game as well. It has a good balance of competition and cooperation between friends. Although the story wasn't awe-inspiring, I found it quite appealing.

NOTE: This game has certain parts that are pretty dark"
Dying Light,Action,239140,Good game
Dying Light,Action,239140,: )
Dying Light,Action,239140,"Alot of ways to bonk zombies while doing parkour with the boys.

Dying Light,Action,239140,A really great game for you if you're into parkour and zombie horror! There are lots of things to do that'll keep you busy. Best with friends as well. I'm glad the devs have been keeping this game alive.

Dying Light,Action,239140,My enjoy for this game : 9.5 / 10
Dying Light,Action,239140,"One of the best games in the zombie open world games (If not the best). If you like parkour and are a fan of zombie games with good stories (the story is too predictable), You should give it a try. It has a lot of replay value. I personally would recommend the Delux version of the game, cause you get all the DLC's."
Dying Light,Action,239140,"great, get following tho, game is pretty easy."
Dying Light,Action,239140,"Awesome game play with amazing 1st person parkour. Story is also good and relatable with our own current reality. Don't be deceived by the lazy zombies during day time. At night u better run or u r dead.
DLC story content are really good and online 4 player coop is one of the best. I had a lot of fun playing with friends and doing missions together. So, I recommend don't play this game solo too much.
Will recommend it to buy right now."
Dying Light,Action,239140,Best zombie game ever made imo. One of most satisfying movement systems in a FPS.
Dying Light,Action,239140,"I beat this in PS4 and i'm glad i get to play it again. One of the best zombie games of the decade, for the pure aspect of parkour. It's so fluid and fun to traverse the towns that I never found myself using fast travel. Once you get skills like tic tac toe, vault and the grappling hook, you'll find yourself coming back only to run around. Definitely buy it when you can, it's on sale pretty often. Please give this and Dying Light 2 a chance when it comes out."

With its many DLC's such as ""The Following"", ""Prison"", ""The Bozak Horde"", and ""Hellraid"" it continues to be just hard enough to keep you coming back and wanting more."
Dying Light,Action,239140,This game never get you bored because of it great atmosphere and keeps you exited to playing until everything is done
Dying Light,Action,239140,A great zombie slashing classic. Honestly it's been out long enough now you really don't need to look at reviews. If you like what you see just get it and have fun. : )
Dying Light,Action,239140,made a friend in this game so thumbs up
Dying Light,Action,239140,"Dying light is what dead island should have been. A very solid game. The parkour is possibly the best in any game I can recall, and the fighting feels weighted very much in realism, aside from the leaping dodge moves you get early in game. Upgrading is fun, not too tedious, and really pays off in various ways. Story is solid but the last boss fight is meh, characters are not-too contrived and side missions are great. Graphically Dying Light is stunning, not only are the environments and character models great but it all looks so very smooth as you're hurtling through the streets. But that's nothing until you start to climb, at a height being able to see across the city during various weathers and daytime the beauty is near flawless.

My rating- 8/10

I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something new. Co-op is pretty good :)

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Destiny 2 is my favorite game and has been since its release. Here are some reasons why:

Pros
-Fun shooting and movement mechanics
-Awesome musical scores
-Beautiful world art and visuals
-A story that started out kinda vague but over the past few years has become much more engaging and intriguing
-A wide variety of weapons, abilities, and armor to choose from and experiment with
-campaigns (I find them fun, especially if it's your first time running through them)
-I really enjoy nightfalls, dungeons, and raids, each of which have varying levels of difficulty
-though may people have mixed thoughts on pvp, I still find it fun and like experimenting with different classes (though it is sorely needing some more updates)
-A community that while labeled as toxic by some, I have still made a lot of friends within
-Bungie keeps updating the game periodically, enough to keep me interested

Cons
-cheaters (though this is a rampant issue, I haven't run into them enough myself to make the experience too negative. Can't say the same for other people though)
-some weapon and ability metas (like stasis) can be a bit oppressive, and the nerfs that reign them in can take time
-content vaulting (though I understand why they do it) just sucks to see some stuff leave"
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"I think the world that bungie has built here is amazing. The lore and a lot of the story building in this game is incredible. On top of that, the gunplay is smooth, the classes are all good in their own ways, and the pve side of this game can be amazing. However, destiny is not a pvp game. Do not go into this game thinking it is going to be a good pvp game. Pvp is full of cheaters and people who haven't seen the sun in years because they were too busy using felwinter's lie on guardians in the crucible. The pve side of things, is much better though. Destiny most definitely has had its ups and downs, and I have taken many breaks from this game throughout the years. Honestly though, this game has a special place in my steam library. Unlike other games, I still remember the first exotic I ever got, I still remember the first time I ever cleared a raid, and I still remember playing gambit for countless hours to get a bow that I only used twice, but who could forget that right? In all seriousness, play this game. Read the lore, learn the characters, master the gunplay, but most of all, don't take the game to seriously or you will end up hating it with a passion."
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Like shooting and looting?  Like the chase of trying to get the perfect rolled piece of gear to complete your flawlessly crafted build.  Then join in and shoot space robots with space magic given by a ball in the sky.  You'll be joining space raids, haunted moons, and scooter races.  Get in here so you can also be salty about crucible."

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,I only played Curse of Osiris DLC
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,Its a good game but I wish that the DLC's would transfer like the character data would
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"I have played this game a fucking lot and what i have realized over time is even if stuff looks as advertised during trailer when it launches ..developers notoriously try to balance things way more focused towards pvp community more often than not which affects stuff you enjoy in pve over time. the reason i bought latest DLC is because I thought  its really good  in pve all the crowd control and buffs etc but since CC is not okay  in pvp they nerfed that aspect of entire stasis which killed the mood to play stasis. I bought a year long pass because i want to see stuff as advertised in trailer to work as advertised in trailer but not your balance ruining the fun factor. 
Game looks great 
Game plays great except when their servers decide to mess with you randomly 
Game is rewarding in its own way 

But its bad investment of the time if i am grinding something because its awesome and when i get it ..since pvp community complains ..devs nerf it to ground in pve and vice versa .. I would really prefer if devs decide to balance PVE and PVP separately as everyone will be happy with their time invested . I will discontinue buying next expansions as i lost trust in the developers.

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Terrible drop rates for any high end gear, no reason for any player to be getting blue level gear at end game state. Repetitive PvE content, not to mention a lot of reused assets every time a new season comes out. PvP is a whole other story, balancing issues, stasis, lack of PvP content; there hasn't been any new pvp map in over 600 days, not to mention cheaters galore in Trials, makes in unplayable and not worth grinding. If you're planning on picking up this game, don't bother, there's a bunch of better games you could be playing out there. Bungie is too busy worrying about what new eververse to put in the store for future seasons/dlc's that they aren't focused on fixing their game."

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Unlike Destiny 1, this installment offers little innovation. There´s a basic model here that was implemented on all expansions, on every stage of Destiny 2 to date:

1) Make a great introductory mission, get players hooked.
2) Make a few updates
3) Copy and paste activities and missions.

From the start this game had no soul, no love at all.

Really different experience from Destiny 1. Played the demo, it sucked but the introductory mission was great. Thought to myself ""Well, D1 was great, let´s give it a chance"".

Wrong decision! Not going to lie, it has some good moments and pvp is still fun. Some strikes and raids are fun as well, that´s why it has the score it has, but wow...it´s years behind the first one in the fun factor.

If I have to congratulate Bungie in any area, that would be in the marketing department. EXCELLENT trailers."

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"The only reason I played this game is because a little midget b-tard came in and demanded my firstborn for doing me some favors back in the day. Naturally I begged him to take literally anything else, cause that's some sketch shiz, and he said he would only take back his demand if I played a thousand hours of this soul sucking masterpiece of a game. Its been almost two years and I finally did it, too bad the bastard already took the kid anyways."

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Destiny 2 is an extremely fun game if you don't sink countless hours into it off of the get go. Every season you hit a point where there's nothing else to do and you get bored of the game. That's why I haven't played in forever, I got bored, I'd been playing since the start on console though. If you get the game, just take it slow and enjoy everything."
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,pvp is really awful but the pve is fun and the lore is top notch. great story but you have to go out of your way to get invested in it.

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"it's ok... not sure about it yet, need to put more hours into it before im certain."
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"After hundreds of hours in both Destiny 1 and 2, loving these games more than anyone should. I can't recommend anyone buy the expansions or any form of dlc for this game.

When I first heard of destiny I imagined an open world, multiplayer, RPG, with space travel, paired with amazing gun play and character customization. 

And the game we all received just is not that, sure it has open-world-like maps and beautiful scenery, the gun play isn't bad which is probably one of the only good things to come out of destiny 1/2. But most maps are linear with practically no reason to explore them, because the loot system is garbage. 

The RPG elements are none existent considering every mission plays out the exact same and any dialogue options are just to progress missions or listen to some random NPC babble on about the planet for 30 mins or some shit. 

Space travel was reduced to a FUCKING LOADING SCREEN. I understand space fights were never expected to be in the game, but are you seriously telling me that the only time I get to see my spaceship is when i'm waiting to play the game? there is nothing like a warframe ship where you can go inside and customize your ships interior or anything close to that you get a colourful heap of space trash that wobbles back an fourth on your loading screen.

Micro-transactions.

Releasing what is effectively a pay to play subscription service for a game people already paid $100+ for and releasing all that content people paid for, for free when you realise people are mad about micro-transactions.... why not just make the whole game a massive micro-transaction, fucking morons.

honestly all i should really have to say to stop people from buying this trash is... 
THE NEWEST DLC IS JUST RE-PACKAGED CONTENT FROM DESTINY BEING RELEASED IN DESTINY 2 AT FULL FUCKING PRICE."

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Ok so Destiny is a series that receives a lot of hate it either sucks or is the best gaming experience someone has had. My ps account has 1000+ hours and i have like 600+ hours on steam then like 500 on destiny 1... the question is, would i recommend destiny 2. Yes and no.
For a casual few hours a week solo between other games style of play this game will not be very enjoyable after about 50 hours because bungie has a hard time making it a welcoming casual experience.
If you're looking for a pvp game there is something oddly rewarding but equally frustrating about destiny 2, its more meta based pvp than skill based (don't get me wrong there are for sure players with tons of skill who play this game) but if a 2000 hour bash got put against a 3rd game noob ik who id have my money on because the end game weapons and armour such as raid and high end activity (trials and master lost sector) can literally be the difference between a teleporting dragon slayer and a guy who turned the wrong corner. So... for a pvp game if you're prepared to put in the hours it will be enjoyable and rewarding, if not i recommend call of duty. 
However if you're looking for a grindy co-op shoot and loot look no further. As you know i have a lot of hours in these games and i can wholeheartedly say ive had more fun on my 60th clear of a raid at 3 am with my 6 man team than ive had on any other game. The raids are the life of this game with fun mechanics, beautiful music, great atmosphere and just insane aesthetics its hard not to enjoy them after hundreds or clears or dozens of fails. The weapon system is fun and lets you use what you find to be fun with exception only in end game areas. 

In short if someone to ask me if they should play destiny 2 i would say yes. You will have a good time with the people you meet or the friends you have but be prepared for a game unlike what you're expecting. And if you get sick of it, take a break, i take months off at a time but always enjoy playing daily when im back.
So have fun and ""good luck out there, guardian"" - Cayde-6"

I have played every mainstream (and a few non-mainstream) MMORPG and none of them come close to feeling as artificially grindy as this game, hell my job isn't as grindy as this game. I cannot believe I put so many hours into this shallow, horrible game I honestly can't think of a single reason I would play it ever again."
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,awesome game all around.
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,yeah i like it
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"I hate that I go back to this game every few months. Especially since in order to consume the newer content I have to waste money on a new expansion. PVP, *PVE, and **community events got stale. The real reason I don't recommend this game is because it's too grindy. Die-hard fans love it but I hate dumping hours into a game just for the progress to not matter the next time an expansion comes out.


*raids are kinda fun.

**bring back faction wars pls. no one gives an s-word about guardian games."

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,Yea.. it's okay i guess
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,This game sucks

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"I've put thousands of hours of my time into Destiny 1 and pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of Destiny 2 as soon as it was available. I've paid money for every expansion since The Taken King and will probably proceed to put my money into this franchise. With that being said, I wouldn't recommend getting into Destiny 2 unless you're willing to put money into the game. Lots of activities are locked off to you unless you purchase the Deluxe Edition of the current expansion so that you can access content from both past and current seasons. I enjoy the gameplay of Destiny 2 but the introduction of the pay-to-play season system has, in my opinion, ruined the game."

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Played it for a bit, it's ok"
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,No matter how much i hate this game even from D1 here I am. Every destiny player has a level of hate for this game but we still come back and play. No cap its a good game though lots of Lore for lore nerds. Raids are fun and theres a lot of different communities where you can get raids done. Grind is there but not as insufferable as warframe. So if you want an easier grind go D2. If you want that spicy grind go suffer in Warframe for fish oil. As a new player you'll have a ton of story to address so it'll hold you off for a while. If you're a returning player after you catch up on story you now have Seals to do. you get a title where some can be guilded every season for the flex. Also it's Mars and Venus I didnt kill gods and take down a regime so someone can tell me the callout is wrong. It's Mars and Venus fight me.
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,Its like a love hate relationship. You love the game but wanna quit it everyday. Its a drug you cant get off of sadly.
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"This is definitely my favorite game to grind, nothing will ever be as good as Destiny 1 but this game definitely comes close. I also really like the fact that they are adding old raids and adventures from the original Destiny to this game. Brings back a lot of nostalgia."
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Removed 75% of the base game, and then charge me the price of a new game for 2 maps. No thanks."
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,Too much farming involve that you almost need to play this exclusively just to get good stuff.
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,Game sucks the soul out of you and yet you just keep coming back. Its like having Stockholm's syndrome. Don't play this game unless you are willing to sell your soul.
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"I wish I could recommend this game to anyone anymore, but I can't. It's basically Destiny 1 2 at this point, which as someone who started playing in Destiny 2: Warmind is just not enjoyable. The grind is boring, the raids are boring and unrewarding, and the pvp has horrible balancing. The game just feels like there's no soul anymore, so just find any other PvE/PvP shooter where the devs actually care."
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,i hate destiny 2 its my favorite game
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,game poopoo
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,Sweet business
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"This game is hard to recommend to others because of the complexity behind its continued development. Despite the strides they've made to make it more friendly to new players, it's difficult to get into unless you really enjoy grinding. As someone who has played since its initial release, I can follow the story and really soak in the lore, but a new player wouldn't have been able to play the sunset material or really understand the game.
Despite that, the gameplay is top tier, and despite a few issues with balancing and PVP content, the game offers a lot for everyone. There is mult-leveled activities for all players, and endgame content that will punish and reward those who wish to try it.
As a free to play game, I would not recommend it to anyone. I see no reason to play this game unless you want to experience everything. If you have OCD, this game will abuse it constantly, with all the badges, triumphs, exotics and seals to collect.
Now for the story; it is one of the greatest, most extensive universes I have ever played in, and the lore is top tier. There are so many stories to get lost in, and the game's story can be enjoyed even when you're not playing the game.
Youtubers such as My Name Is Byf, have made lore videos that help you dive into the world and understand the past content that is no longer playable.
Overall, I highly recommend the game to people who want something to sink a chunk of their life into, but this game is not a casual one."
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"my favorite part of destiny 2 is when i play trials and the anti cheat is so incredibly bad that a guy can shoot me through a wall after never grazing flawless in his life, pretty sick though. would rather wipe my ass with sandpaper."
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Despicable story line, first game was incredible"
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,its a great game don't get me wrong i love it with all my heart and i have devoted 7 years almost 8 years of my life playing this and nothing but this i went fro ps4 to this and i can say it drains you and takes everything from you it frustrates me and bothers me that i always come back to it. Goodluck and play knowing you will lose everything
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Decent game to play when you hate life, no anti cheat but most cheaters are grabo, miss cayde. 7/10!"
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"First time ever I get to play a Tomb Raider game and I'm glad I started with this one. An excellent reboot of Tomb Raider, such a great game with great graphics and design of characters, Story-wise is nice too feels like a proper TR story, gameplay-wise is very fun for me experiencing a TR game ( Mini puzzles, secret tombs, and crafting weapons) plus the voice acting of Lara is perfect I've seen amongst other Laras'. I'm so looking forward to playing Rise/Shadow of Tomb Raider next time I get the chance, looking at gameplays of them they look ""Worth it"" defiantly."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,2013 masterpiece
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"A good interactive ""game-movie"" with an excelent main character.

Most of the time, Tomb Raider feels like a press and hold W interactive movie followed by a couple of quick time events. There is nothing wrong about it if the ""movie"" is good, and Tomb Raider is a good one.

There is no real difficulty to it, so I recommend it to everyone who has started in the gaming world as a first game, you can learn the basics of movement, quick time events, upgrades, exploration and combat. It has a good enough story about becoming stronger, facing sacrifice and make it worth it. And Lara Croft (reboot) is a truly memorable character that has gained a place in modern gaming history.

Explosions, non-stop action, Japanese temples, samurai-demons (Oni), tombs awaiting to be raided and a young Lara Croft that slowly transforms into the real definition of a strong survivor and a knowledge-thirsty adventurer.

A 2013 Triple-A game that aged very well. Graphics look good and mechanics are still fresh and solid.

Don't wait for them to give it for free again, it may never happen, go ahead and buy it, it should be worth more than what it's going for anyway."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Think you can survive crazy elements and an even crazier cult? Yeah? Then get this. Gameplay is really great, action cutscenes are flawless, and story is better than most games out there."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"funny engaging and simple combat and  great stealth elements if u wanna play it that way. 
the puzzles are cool and not too dumb, the platforming is pleasurable.
the main story... I simply don't care. The quick time events and the cutscenes are quite annoying, however you can skip the latter ones.
I wish there were more different settings, not the same island. The ability to revisit all levels after completing the storyline is nice though.

1000 lara moans out of 10"
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Amazing Game Loved It...
"
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"I mix up all these Tomb Raider games in my head man. But I recommend them on sale. The third one has awesome graphics. This is the first one I believe! 9.1/10 from IGN, trailer was just showing it while I wrote this. Been a few years since I played so I have to agree. 9.25/10 from some other reviewer though, trailer flashed by again. Let's split the difference: 9.175/10 for me."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"1. There are no tombs in Tomb Raider.

2. Lara Croft is a mass murdering psychopath whining about shooting a man, before killing all his mates immediately after.  Lara killed people in previous Tomb Raider games as well, but the way this game presents it, it falls narratively flat and is impossible to empathize with.  Maybe they should have saved this part of her development for the second or third title, or had her be a Batman style hero who doesn't kill.  But nope, Action sells.

3. We know Tomb Raider was build on large, desolate environments, ancient tombs and mythological settings and the wonder of exploring them.  There were some missteps in the franchise but it usually returned to form.  This game: here's World War II island, Bear Grylls kills 10 men with a single arrow and then bombs a dozen more.

4. The game is a Lara Croft torture and death simulator, I guess that makes some people happy.

It's alright for what it is, which is a third-person action game, but for someone looking for a great Tomb Raider game, Lara Croft is for all intents dead.  If this is what we get from now on, and the best Tomb Raider game we get is a top-down twin-stick shooter that nails the feel and spirit of the franchise better than a triple A blockbuster like this, then I am very sad indeed.

I'd have no problem playing a female-led Splinter Cell game, but I don't want a sneaking, murdering Sam Fisher in my Tomb Raider game.

Lara Croft was always a female Indiana Jones.  This Lara is a female Nathan Drake, which is ironic because Uncharted was imitating Tomb Raider.

Also why did they release a graphical upgrade for the 'next-gen' console systems but they left us with this Lara who looks nothing like her cutscene representations?"

[h1]Story[/h1]
The premise is really good, stranded on an island ruled by a supernatural entity that causes weird storms and is worshiped by your enemies.
When you start out is really feels like your making your way into a inhospitable place at the edge of your capabilities. You feel as if the entity is watching you by striking at you with lightning as the rain is pouring down to make you lose your grip and fall to your death.

By the time morning rolls around its all gone.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game just becomes 3rd person action game were you go about cleaning the island of it's enemies. No more supernatural enemies or mystery just Call Of Duty soldiers with rifles, shotguns and shields.
I do not understand like what happened in the development, there so many ideas:
- when you get to the beach it becomes clear that the island has been stranding peoples from all eras, pirates, merchants, WW2 soldiers etc. Why don't you fight against multiple different groups each seeking a different goal.
- the game is set in multiple environments but the they all kinda feel the same, like you don't feel the altitude at all.
The game is supposed to be set in the mountains but there is no point were you have to follow a narrow path going up and risking to fall, for the majority of the game if you look down you will see the generic walkable ground and not some vista of the mountains. In fact most of the levels seem to be cornered of somehow, I do not remember ever falling out of the level at it's edge.
- the platforming, the core traversal mechanic (actually jogging is core traversal mechanic in practice) is boring.
It's the same Prince Of Persia/Uncharted style of ledge grabing were you can go and make yourself a coffe while Lara is holding on to the edge.
There is no skill involved in traversal, no puzzle of what ledges you need to grab in order to reach your destination because most traversal sections are one way only and no timing skill you don't have to time you jumps at all you just need to reach the end of the ledge.
I think you can do most of the platforming with just one finger because Lara doesn't seem to jump farther if jump while running. I don't remember ever having to jump further that before (I write this review some time later though after playing the game).

[h1]Portraial[/h1]
I usually don't care as much and I am not a fan of the old games but after taking a break from the game and playing Batman Arkham City I couldn't help noticing some stuff:
- why is Lara for the entire game portrait as weak, like you can be on the beach level near the end fully equipped, leveled up, 3 digit kill count and having overcome some stuff but her expression is ""afraid please help me"".
You would think after killing people by driving her pickaxe into their skulls and after rising from blood she should be more like Rambo: First Blood, a predator.
Why do Crysis 2, Batman: Arkham Knight and Far Cry get to have confident characters from the start and throughout the game.
- why does Lara need to suffer and look injured ALL THE TIME to prove she is strong (wash your face and change clothes there a plenty of downed enemies).
I have not played a game were your character get ping ponged so much into everything.
Did you really need to have fatalities for all deaths including from the enemies ? it's not a horror game.
- you could be at 95% of the game and Lara still says to herself ""You can do it Lara"".
Do you think Batman says to himself encouragements or do you think his enemies need encouragements to face Batman.

In the end it's meh."

Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Tomb Raider 2013, fairly old now in 2021 at 8 years old, but I'm glad to say it's still amazing.

The graphics are beautiful, and don't make the game feel old at all; and the soundtrack is pretty decent for the type of game that Tomb Raider is.

The story is decent, there's nothing too special about it - just another survivor story, really, but what makes this different is the way the story is presented. The map is open, and you can mostly go wherever you want except for a few story parts. The gameplay is fairly well flowing as well, there are very few and very short load times between parts of a map, and they're mostly hidden behind cutscenes.

Combat is OK, it can get quite repetitive with enemies repeating the same attacks over and over, and it can get quite monotonous. Mechanics in the game are great, and the game doesn't give you a huge tutorial at the start - one mechanic is only given at the very end-game, which is nice.

Overall, other than a few minor complaints (as listed above), the game is great. I didn't find any bugs at all. 

Definitely recommend this to anyone thinking of buying it! I'd give this game a solid 8/10."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,Appreciate this game developer very much for making a very beautifully made action game for Lara Croft. Will definitely buy the rest. Awesome!
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Honestly, I was floored by how good this game was. I thought it looked interesting and enjoyed the original 90s games when I was a kid so I decided to give it a try. It's so well done. The story is really interesting and significantly above average for games these days, the game itself is stunning, the controls feel incredibly natural and the voice acting is brilliant. Little things like how enemies do not respawn once you've killed them makes going back to previous zones to explore every nook and cranny a joy. You can upgrade your weapons but the crafting system isn't overly complex. Lara herself is just incredibly acted, modelled, animated and written. You really watch her grow from a frightened girl to a wrathful killing machine and you feel the anger build along with her as you play through."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"back in these days the devs actually knew what they were doing. an important thing to realise about this one is that it is not an offical part of the Tomb Raider IP, it is doing its own special thing on the side but is still under the same umbrella as the originals."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"This is the first Tomb Raider game I've played, besides something on a gameboy color I never finished. My playtime is competing the story and a few tombs (tombs are side mission puzzles). I probably won't be replaying it anytime soon, but I enjoyed most of the playthrough very much.

This is a movie game. Quick time events, running on platforms that are crumbling with every step, and LOTS AND LOTS OF CLIMBING. Alternate title could be Rock Climber Simulator 2013 (laugh). 

The combat was good, with four different guns with upgrades. I really wouldn't call this a third person shooter, but yeah there's a lot. The next thing is the climbing. I'm going to be honest, I love platformers, and I loive the sections where you're climbing up a deteriorating bridge and stuff, but sometimes climbing rocks feels tedious.

I liked the story, it was simple, the cutscenes didn't go on too long and the cinematic gameplay is some of the best I've seen. Overall, this game was great, I got it for only $2.24, I will definitely think about buying the sequels."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Tomb Raider is not a perfect game but it's definitely worth a shot!

1. Music: 2/10
2. Story: 6.5/10
3. Level Design 10/10
4. Gameplay 9/10

The game is really good, it progresses really nicely, the characters are all well thought out, the level design is great and intractable, and game mechanics are nice and unique. But sadly it does have some downsides, for example the auditory experience of the game is nothing to write home about (its just downright boring). And while the story is good, the beginning and the end of it don't really contrast well. And for a 2013 game the enemy AI seems very robotic and outdated.

7/10 - Overall Tomb Raider is a great game and you should give it a try! 

Side note: This is a relatively old game so it should run good on slower hardware in my case it ran at a consistent 60fps on my mx130 laptop on the lowest settings."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Amazing gemplay, nice graphics, great plot. I recommend  <3"

Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"[h1] OH MY GOD THIS IS GAME SO GOOD [/h1]
I've got one my of my times within the main history, that's it.
I grew up with TR: Legend, Anniversary and Underworld on the PS2 when I was 8/9yo and I loved this series of game, when this got announced I was super excited, couldn't play it tho, because I didn't have a PC (neither PS3 or Xbox 360).
[b] Worth the full price without a doubt [/b]
I'm happy because I got to play this being older and more ""aware"" of whats behind the game, this game it's one the best experiences that I had with a game, this review is everything but objective, this is pure based on my experience and the backstory that I have with TR series.
Gameplay-wise the mechanics are great, super easy to handle, nothing to complain.
Story-wise I think it's one the best of the series, all the little books that gives the characters the development is on point. makes you feel more ""into"" the story I would say.
Feels weird to say it but seing Lara [b] suffer [/b] or being [b] weak [/b] makes me super happy, in a [i] this character its more deep than ever. [/i] 
[spoiler] I LOVE how you don't get duals until the end, every single time I was shaking thinking [i] IS SHE GONNA GRAB IT??? [/i]
The final sequences are not very special I'd say, Mathais dies like, instantly, and well, I think he deserved a more propper death, or at least just wanna shot him once. [/spoiler]
Definitely worth it. Probably gonna play the main story again before running into [b] Rise of the Tomb Raider [/b]"
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,qwceqwcewq
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,YES
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,Had a good wank 10/10. Will wank again
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"I could not play the game, becasue of the shaky camera. It was wobbly even during sitting still cut-scenes, causing motion sickness. Did not expect that from a third person game. There is also no current fix.
------------------Update ----------------------------
After googling for an hour or so, I found the Yamatai patch. It is a hacker thingy, but with it the game is now playable. Only the cut-scenes feel like Hollywood hired some drunks to film them on hand-held smartphones. The graphics sure are beautiful, but sadly had to enjoy with all the shaking.

Overall the game does not feel like a classical Tomb Rider. The creators are trying to re-invent the series. If this is good or bad, I think is more personal preference. The game is not bad, not bad at all.
Personally I think here is too much ''RIDER'' and too little ''TOMB''. It lacks the thing I call ''romance of archeology and new discovery''. The game compensates this with lots of action and ''see bad guy - shoot bad guy or blow him up''. Blood, blood everywhere folks.
Sometimes I wish, the game would give more breathing room between the action. After almost dying a few times, Lara almost dies some more. After the fifth near death experience, the sixth in the row makes you just deadpan ''sigh, here I go again.'' or ''meh, seen worse. Let's just get this over with, shall we?'' There is so much drama, you just stop feeling it after some time. Things that kept you on the edge the first few times they happened, stop being effective. I think if there were more leisure moments, for example Lara looking for some soap to wash of all the blood (a persistent thought I get every time Lara hits the dirt, flying debris, mud or takes a swim in blood rivers), the action that comes after a respite would be felt stronger, because of contrast
All in all, game is good, but I would not recommend it for the faint of heart. The shock factor is ... shocking, but story wise it is quite lacking. The villains are a one dimensional ''evil cult'', no more. I keep marveling at how bad Lara's karma is.
Personally I call this ''little girl suffering simulator - road to bad ass''.
It is fun to play, but will tire you out."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"A great addition to the Tomb Raider franchise, nice storyline and characters. The details in the game are pretty good but not amazing, which I prefer as to a certain point saving on storage is better than having a hyper-realistic environment. Only thing I would like to add in is that I was confused during the beginning when you're stuck under a rock and kicking the man away. When the circle came up to indicate a certain button needed to be pressed, I didn't know what I had to do so after around 10 replays I needed to search up that the f key needed to be pressed. Overall, solid 7.5/10 game, not absolutely amazing but would recommend."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,Too good for 2013 game.. lot of action... 9.9/10
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"This is one of the better action-adventure games.  One of the best in my opinion.  It is so beautiful and well-done that it still provides enjoyable and immersive play eight years later.  

It only takes about 15-20 hours to finish it as a leisurely pace.  But this is brilliant.  The game only asks the player to spend the amount of time on it that it is willing to deliver a tightly packed dose of fun, action, and story.  It doesn’t try to keep the player grinding long after all the content is used up or even grind to unlock it.  It’s a story and you play through it.  It ends while it’s still a blast and you walk away having had a good time. 

As far as the story goes, the characters are just as campy and the plot as straightforward as you would expect, but this is Tomb Raider.  It’s supposed to be like that.  All said, they did a great job and the interactions are deeper and more heartfelt than I had expected (for what it is).  

Some have bemoaned the character design change from ye olde days.  But honestly, besides being a bit thinner Laura looks like Laura in real, human form rather than goofy cartoon form.  

The modeling and character design is great, especially for the year it was made.  There is some jankeyness with the environmental interactions as well as the animations, and there are some bugs although I only experienced a few minor ones.  So it’s not always as smooth a butter.

Highly recommended.
"
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"The game has a wonderful story. If you're a Tomb Raider Saga fan this game its pretty amazing, the controls, the graphics, the semi-open world that they provide you is amazing. But I specially liked a lot the story that the developers told to you, they shows us a humanized Lara Croft with all the human emotions that allows you to empathize with the character."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,This game has such a terrific and amazing action filled campaign that never wants you to take a break. I haven't felt this way about a single-player game in quite some time. I highly recommend this game to any one who wants a challenging story rich game play experience
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"E
"
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,OP game of all time for mac
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"5 minutes in the game and I'm HOOKED! 

I was so moved by everything that was happening to Lara. Shipwrecked, near-drowned, knocked unconscious, wakes up hanging upside down, tries to escape and gets pierced by a rod through her stomach. Its impossible not to FEEL for her. 

The Gameplay is so smooth, I cannot figure out when its a cut-scene and when I'm controlling the character. For a 2013 game, the gameplay and graphics is as good as any game today.

The voice acting is done perfectly for this origin story. Lara's voice is soft and shows her to be a simple girl caught in terrible circumstances. And over the course of the story, she develops confidence and at turns into the badass Lara Croft that we've seen in previous games. Especially notable is the scene with the dual-guns that indicate her transformation.

I play my games on Easy mode and was able to finish this while dying only a few times. I didn't encounter any bugs.

The Multiplayer is hard because other people are either Level 60 or Level 1 so for a newbie you get killed again and again. Also, there aren't many people playing Multiplayer as this game is quite old. But the Singleplayer more than makes up for this.

I wasn't sure whether to buy this game. Because I don't like wolves, I don't like playing in a night scene, and I don't like using bows. Thankfully, using the bow was fairly simple and the wolves pestered me only twice and the game alternates between night and day over the levels. This game has been a pleasant surprise. Enough that I will also play the sequels.

If you are undecided about buying this, just look at the fact that the Reviews tag this game as 'Overwhelmingly Positive'. That should be enough for anyone to blindly grab this game.

Lara may cry and say, ""I hate Tombs.""
But I'll laugh and say, ""I love Tomb Raider."""
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"In my eyes this game is a revolution for a action-adventure game class
Also this one is the new begining for tomb raider series that i like a lot
Story telling is really good and it almost feels like you are having same emotions with lara.
Gameplay and all of those new mechanichs fits with the game and new design of lara is on fire.
I would say it is one of the most important games in its field.

Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,"this is probably one of the funnest games I ever played, and I only invested 43 hours into it though but I thought to give it my honest opinion . So much replay ability and every run you play, you most likely will get different items. You can use different setups on different characters that makes it a little unique. At the end game, you most likely will be one shotting mostly everything or killing everything insanely fast. You will feel broken at the endgame, but you can still get one shotted by a lot of things. Just because you have a lot of items, doesn't mean you are invincible. I think that is want makes the game great. Also, you need to invested your time into the game to get new characters and abilities. This game is not P2W and runs can last for hours. This game has two different play styles, you can take your time on each level and get all the items but the enemies will be really strong. Or you can speedrun the game and get very few items and have the enemies be weak. This game is full of potential and I can't wait for the updates in the future. 👍"

love it."
Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,"Unlike others I have not put countless hours in this game, and let me tell you why:

Every run is the same. 

I love rogue-likes. Most rogue-likes have one thing in common: variety. There is variety in weapons, in effects, in synergies, in levels, everything. No one run is similar to the other because you unlock new weapons and artifacts/equipment and end up with some crazy stuff. 

This game? You got items that:
- Double your healing
- Make you do 10% more crit
- Do some damage to stuff around you
- Faster sprints/movement

And so on. All items I've encountered are just stat items, they make you stronger in the long run but nothing interesting, just numbers and small effects. 

Now, there are equipments which do some cool stuff, like turn you into a fire elemental and whatnot, but these are rare items and honestly even these are boring. This one super rare item? turns you into three balls of fire for 6 seconds, this other one? doubles your healing, this other one? shoots a small black hole for 5-6 seconds. 

This is my opinion of course, but as far as rogue-likes go, this one is meh at best, boring at worst."

Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,"Ok so this game is amazing, its a lot of fun and even more fun with friends. it has a lot of replay value.

The music while repetative is polished and fits perfectly.

The art is asteticly pleasing.

The lore is deep. The books are fun reads.

there are still some bugs even still but the dev team is always fixing it.

sadly the game is geared for rapid fire on hit effects. and while you can play the melee characters they fall off very quickly in comparison to the rapid hit range characters.

the games difficulty ramps quickly but once you get on the other side of the curve you just start steam rolling.

while playing in a group if you die once you fall so far behind that its almost impossible to catch up

all in all an amazing group time waster. runs can last 30 min to over an hour.  

8.5/10 would never turn down a game with my friends."

Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,i was i the middle of a 2 hour long run where i had every item in the game (that i had unlocked) and i had the great idea to stack shaped glass which doubles your damage but cuts your max health in half until my max hp was 2 (before it was something like 1.5k). I thought i would die instantly but because of something called oneshot protection (a system that make it so if you are above 90% health and you get hit the lowest you can go is 10% health) and an item that heals you for 15 health each time you get hit i was practically invincible because i would get hit and not die because of oneshot protection and then get healed back to full health since my max was less than 15. i ended up dying to a special type of enemy that gives you a debuff that prevents any form of healing. 10000000/10 this game is so good

Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,"You either suffer normally, or suffer from success."
Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,"This game is excellent at everything it tries to do. It's a great rogue-like that rewards not only good decision making but also raw skill, has a variety of characters to choose from, and has a good progression/unlock system that doesn't feel too grindy. The one thing that this game needs is more incentives to play prismatic trials/other alternate game modes, but those will be released later with time. The base game alone is fun enough as is."

Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,"Very epic poggers sussy baka ooga booga
"
Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,ITS GOOD. I PLAYED IT FOR A BIT.
Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,"Well, there a few games that hook me up from time to time, and this one is part of that group. The game is a rogue-lite TPS with bullet hell/horde co-op (imagine games like Alien Swarm), where sometimes it gets too mental. It's a pretty fun and intense experience, both on single player and co-op, and it's time manegement mechanic can change how you play your run.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
• Great gameplay loop
• You can choose dificulty level (directly, or with [spoiler] artifacts you unlock in-game[/spoiler].
• [spoiler]Those artifacts you unlock in-game[/spoiler] can also be used to spice up your experience.
• Most survivors (playable characters) are fun to use
• Lovely soundtrack (there are songs with ""fart"" and ""f**k"" in the name hehe)

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
• Can be harsh in the beggining
• Lots of items needs to be unlocked before they are able to spawn in runs
• Most survivors need to be unlocked. And then, some of their skill variants also need to be unlocked. This makes hard to find your favorite survivor/skill setup


""Should I try it?"" Yes, and also good with friends."
Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,"""are you yung lean?"" - huntress"
Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,"Honestly, one of the best games I've ever played. 
Best builds to play: 
-----------------
Mosquito Huntress 
Needed items: 5+ Purity or 2+ Hardlight Afterburners 
I'm already unlucky as can be so purity doesn't affect me much. I just like to zoom around the map with my dash and do absolutely zero damage
------------------
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Loader 
Needed items: Any attack speed and shield item 
Just punch so fast that you can never lose enough shield to actually lose hp 
-------------------
Sonic Huntress 
Needed items: Any movement speed item + Little Disciple 
The faster you go, the more damage you do. 
No matter what just don't stop running. Huntress is the best for this because you can go Rose Buckler and just spend the entire time sprinting and attacking

10/10 Game 
"
Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,"This game is so good and the Devs just keep updating it. I'm not disappointed with any aspects of the game. I would like there to be more items, shrines, elites and survivors. 

I love this game!!!"
Risk of Rain 2,Action,632360,"Look, once upon a time I used to adore this game. In fact, I loved it so much I set out on a journey. This journey was to acquire, for the first time in my steam library history, every achievement in a game. I was so excited, the achievements were difficult but not impossible and seemed like a fun goal. While here I am over one hundred hours later and I have but one lonely achievement. For the life of me I cannot beat the game with that virgin garbage tier mercenary they added in the game. He sucks, and I hate my life. I have died more times than I could ever hope to count, and I am on the verge of uninstalling as I sit teary eyed at my computer. I just want this game to be fun again, but mercenary has pissed that all away. I won't even be able to play once I eventually do get the achievement because I will have to look at his stupid face when I select another, LITERALLY ANY OTHER, character at the screen. Even worse, from here on out I have to go to bed each and every night knowing that there are people who main mercenary, and that thought alone is too much to bear. Other than that great game."

Cons
Can chug a bit on late runs, but thats extremely hard to not have happen
Some achievements  can be real bitches to get, but definitely worth the pain

I held off the half life series for 10 years and I am so glad I checked it out. This game does and always will deserve a 10/10/

Half-Life 2,Action,220,"Pros
- For a game that is extremely linear, HL2 still allows you to figure stuff out for yourself. Letting you play around with game mechanics, until you reach the goal. Guiding without hand-holding.

- HL2 tends to be more immersive than many modern day shooters with a few simple game design choices. The exclusion of a minimap is one of those choices.

- Gravity Gun

- Succeeds in crafting a rich lore behind HL2 by only showing the player what needs to be revealed and leaving everything else to the imagination.

- Gordon Freeman's presentation as a game protagonist is simply perfect. Valve went above and beyond to let players project themselves on the physicist, especially with him being in cryogenic slumber the whole time between HL1 and HL2, he does not know what has conspired in the years between. Gordon must piece everything together along with the player in a home that feels alien.

Cons
- Lighting in the vanilla version as of 2021 is simply terrible.Places feel weirdly ""uniformly well lit"" as if there are studio lights in every corner. Fortunately, this wasn't the original lighting in the game afaik. Older videos have much better use of lighting as a guiding tool through the levels.

- Gunplay hasn't aged well. The assault rifle is especially terrible. The Shotgun and the crossbow are the only things that feel ok. Of course this does not apply to the magical gravity gun.

- Use of Infinite enemies to force the player to rush through certain areas, excepting the antlions in the Highway 17 chapters. Using infinite enemies is just bad game design in my books and I am happy to see it is a practice we have mostly left behind.

- Squad AI. Let's just say I was better off alone.


In the meantime... this is where I get off."
Half-Life 2,Action,220,"Здається минуло вже 17 років від того як ця гра побачила світ. На віриться, адже я грав її ще тоді. Можна сказати, пройшло вже пів-життя з моменту першого знайомства з цією грою, хєхє.
Багато чого змінилось за ці 17 років, але не все. В першу чергу, це все ще чудова гра. Я, чесно, ледве можу назвати ще хоча б одну гру з початку 2000х яка б так добре виглядала і гралась вже сьогодні. 
Так, зараз це вже не революційний проект яким він був колись. Але бавитись з гравітацією так само весело, кампанія так само захоплює, світ гри так само інтригує як і тоді. 
Чи це шедевр? Залежить від перспективи. Для того щоб об'єктивно оцінити гру, що вийшла 17 років тому -- треба поставити себе на місце гравця, що жив 17 років тому. Тим не менш, якщо гра так добре збереглась опісля всіх цих років, можливо це навіть щось інше.
Мені здається, Half-Life 2 -- це золотий стандарт, що став основою ігрової індустрії на десятиліття вперед. І золото не іржавіє.

This game is one of the best games I've played in my life, it's been 5 years but this game feels like came out yesterday and there are so many details there, Mick Gordon the artist did pretty good job with his music in game you can barely feel time passing and you get motivation and feel bad-ass af, Definitely it is worthy of every cent of your money and you should experience this game till you are alive. Remember guys violence is not answer, it's a solution and it must be used in right way such as ripping and tearing demons in Hell. 
Don't forget to check my other reviews, PISS OUT!"

I've nothing bad to say about DOOM (2016), it is amazing. Worth the full-price. RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT'S DONE!"

DOOM,Action,379720,"This game is just SO. SATISFYING. Combat never stops. I love the kills and challenges. The enemies get tougher at a nice pace and really amps up at the end. Boss battles are incredible.

I'll probably play this again one day and just murder through it."
DOOM,Action,379720,"the creatures are scary
"
DOOM,Action,379720,hehe demon go splat
DOOM,Action,379720,"In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.

Tempered by the fires of Hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak. For he alone was the Hell Walker, the Unchained Predator, who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the slaves of Doom with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but demon had before.

And in his conquest against the blackened souls of the doomed, his prowess was shown. In his crusade, the seraphim bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the obsidian pillars of the Blood Temples. He set forth without pity upon the beasts of the nine circles. Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the Doom Slayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realm.

he age of his reckoning was uncounted. The scribes carved his name deep in the tablets of Hell across eons, and each battle etched terror in the hearts of the demons. They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked. For he alone could draw strength from his fallen foes, and ever his power grew, swift and unrelenting.

None could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer. Despair spread before him like a plague, striking fear into the shadow-dwellers, driving them to deeper and darker pits. But from the depths of the abyss rose The Great One, a champion mightier than all who had come before. The Titan, of immeasurable power and ferocity. He strode upon the plain and faced the Doom Slayer, and a mighty battle was fought on the desolate plains. The Titan fought with the fury of the countless that had fallen at the Doom Slayer's hand, but there fell the Titan, and in his defeat the shadow horde were routed.

And in his terrible rancor between worlds and through time, the Hell Walker found the wretch who shall not be named, but in his heresy was loyal to his evil cause. The wretch adorned the Doom Slayer in a mighty armor, wrought in the forges of Hell, impenetrable and unyielding. With sword and shield of adamantine strength, the Doom Slayer set to banishing all that were left unbroken by his savagery to the void. Yet as the mighty Titan fell and dread engulfed the armies of Doom, the demon priests of the Blood Temples laid a trap to capture this scourge of Hell. Insatiable, even by the vanquishing of the Great One, the Hell Walker sought prey in the tombs of the Blood Keep. And blinded by his fervor, the lure drew him in. The priests brought down the temple upon the Doom Slayer, and in his defeat entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus. The mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all of Hell that the terror within must never be freed. There he lies still, and ever more, in silent suffering."

DOOM,Action,379720,"DOOM has grown up.

I've been playing since the first installment, and the series has only gotten better. A poop ton FASTER too... i mean, i knew i was getting into some speed here, this is NOT a slow moving DOOM II update with a few fancy additions; this is a new level of Hell.

For a while there, during game play, i thought i was getting old... everything moves real fast, some of the weapons act differently... BUT, if i dose myself real good with coffee before i take on a section of this game, i think i do OK.

Visually, the game is stunning. Audibly, it is liquid gold. All of your favorite baddies return and they are modeled to impress.

10.7 Hours of record at the time of this review, have not completed the game yet. It's my understanding that this game can be called 'short' or 'not as long as it should be', but i am enjoying it anyway.

Bethesda has outdone themselves with this game."

DOOM,Action,379720,this game captured the doom essence
DOOM,Action,379720,"The B.F.G of 2016. What hasn't been said about doom 2016. Being a soft reboot to the original game. Doom 2016 brought the franchise back to its rip and tear roots. Though Doom 3 was a great game. [any one saying otherwise isn't playing the game right.] Focusing more on the action aspect of action horror then its predecessor. Doom 2016 encourages the player to ram their fist down a demons throat Instead of waiting for it to leap from the shadows. 
 Placing you in the boots of the Doom slayer. Being the scourge plaguing the demons instead of the other way around. You will scorch, break, maim, and eviscerate everything that calls itself a hell spawn. Being a doom game and all you have all the classic weapons from the chainsaw all the way to the B.F.G 9000. To suit your demon killing needs. A good touch was including the power up from OG doom in certain arenas doted through out the game.
  Each chapter either taking place in U.A.C facility on Mars or hell. You'll be bouncing back and fourth between the two to complete the campiagn the story for those who care is good. But the stand out is the set pieces in Hell. looking like art ripped right off a Metal album covers. Paired with Mick Gordans soundtrack will be thumping your foot while super shotguning your way through the horde. 
Rip and Fuc@ing tear indeed.

DOOM,Action,379720,"Doom is one of the best rage shooters in its class. from the classic Doom all the way to Doom Eternal each game is fun and challenging. If all you are craving is to simply blow away demons in every gory way you can imagine, this is the game for you. It is simply fun, the story is fine and all but there is no game mechanic more satisfying then running willy nilly through a level blasting away at demons."

Doom was intense, high energy that took full concentration, and was incredibly satisfying throughout. Highly reccomend for anyone who likes a demanding, fast-paced action game!"
DOOM,Action,379720,"Solid shooter, with awesome graphics and good performance.

So... Why the thumbs down?
Well, as you see I only have a few hours into it.

I've made the mistake buying the game upon the hype. Was interested what it is about, but it honestly feels like that Doom movie with The Rock and Karl Urban.
Something which I watched once.
Yet in regards of the game... It's a linear shooter.
Which shouldn't be a problem as I really like linear shooters, but this one simply didn't do it for me.

It's a bit too plain for my taste.

I had it installed for a few months and 3.7 hrs was all I could get out of it.


Then suddenly the game received BIIIIIIIIG multiplayer updates, that got even forced onto people who couldn't care less about some dumb multiplayer mode.
Yet as I already struggled with singleplayer being not really entertaining for me, I uninstalled it and haven't touched it since then.


So for what the game costed, it's surely worth a thumbs down as it failed in entertaining me.
Which is the sole purpose of a video game.

But that's just my own taste it didn't fit with."
DOOM,Action,379720,"Few series get the distinction of being both the progenitor and best of their genre. DOOM 2016 is one of the rare games that holds that mantle. Fast and furious combat, an intriguing story (as odd as that sounds) that doesn't get in the way of the action, and enough secrets and unlocks to keep anybody entertained. Each weapon has a place in your arsenal, each mod has it's use in combat, and nothing will slow you down except hesitating to pull the trigger."
DOOM,Action,379720,"Runs great, looks great, pretty fun but a little too slow and simple. Combat speed was definitely slowed down for consoles and it takes a while to get up to fights that are actually long and fun."

DOOM,Action,379720,"funny and good, recommend for every gamer"
DOOM,Action,379720,"Definitely awoke my inner christian in me! I will now be wearing a cross anywhere I go.


In all seriousness, this game is marveleous! It is a high stress, rewarding FPS that will make your blood boil wanting to kill every single thing in existence around you! Its not only the fluent gameplay and the brutal Glory-Kills that make the game absolutely phenomenal. Ive genuenly never heared such good music be implemented into a game as in DOOM. The music by the literal god Mick Gordon makes it so that you can have and eyegasm and and eargasm at the same time. 
The replayability of the game is HUGE. Ive played through the whole thing on all difficulties up til Nightmare and the harder the difficulty the more you will have to stress about things like the monsters making LITERALLY 5 times as much damage to you as in the previous playthroughs. 

This game is one that I will cherish for as long as possible! I would definitely reccomend it!"

10/10 would recommend to get heartbroken again!"
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"I like the Bioshock franchise a lot, i've played all of the games multiple times.
I highly recomend this game to people that has played the earlier games in ther franchise."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Really fun bioshock game. If you have played the previous bioshock games, you would like this one. All the bioshock games are a masterpiece and its story is already top-tier. The graphics and audio are also on another level. This game really holds its own as one of the strongest story games ever. This game also ties in to the bioshock timeline and it was just really fun to experience and enjoy. I really recommend this game if you are looking for an eye opening experience. On a side note, this game is pretty hard to grind all the achievements."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Great game so far.....great story, great graphics (for low specs)......also 2 dlcs' are great.The ending of the main game is quite complex. Game play time is no so long but its time worthy."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,The first difficult combat story-based game that actually has your companion genuinely help you in combat.
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"It nicely closes and ties together the story. I loved the ending.

It's different than the previous 2 instalments. You're no longer in a closed dark space, the world is brighter and more open. You don't carry around medkits anymore, there's no manual saving (auto save mechanics), you can only carry 2 weapons at the same time (you can easily find a new one pretty much anywhere). Most of all it did not crash at all for me, unlike bioshock 1 and 2."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,So I played a free copy of this potentially at some point on a PC... figured I'd send Irrational Games the $$ I owed them. Checked it out for 35 minutes but it lacked features that modern PC games typically have which made me not want to play. Also played it on Xbox. Really fun!
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"This has to be the most overrated game of all time. It is a watered down experience compared to all its Predecessors and is the text book definition of ""all flash & no substance""."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,I loved every second. END OF THE REVIEW
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,The base game is fun but it can be very confusing at times. I would recommend getting the DLCs. Overall great game.
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"The gameplay has some pacing and gameplay issues that many gamers might ignore while others will find mindly frustrating.
On top of that the main campaign completly neglects the storytelling and narrative that bioshock is famous for. However this game tells an emotional story and introduces nice twists like a good bioshock game should do. Thankfully many of the problems i had with the main campaign are not apparent in the 2 dlc that revolve around rapture .Its a good experience that is 100% worth its price when bought with the bioshock collection ."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,Best Game I have ever played
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,i want to fuck elizabeth
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Where do I begin. This game has it all: high fidelity graphics, thrilling gameplay, philosophy, paradoxical beauty, and politics. While I fear this review may become too long, I would be remiss if I skipped over any of these topics. 

Let's start from the top, shall we? The graphics. Wow, it's not often you think you are watching a movie while playing a game, but it's a common occurrence while playing Bioshock Infinity. What strikes me most is the extremely high fidelity, if one was asked to guess what year this game came out I wager most would say after the latter half of the decade, and they would be wrong. I myself am a bit of an expert on these things and am able to pinpoint the game came out in 2013, though that's not to say it doesn't look extremely impressive for its time. 

The gameplay is nothing short of the best of its generation. When I say thrilling, I really mean it. There are times when you are thousands of feet in the air, soaring above the Earth, while moving nauseatingly fast and in these moments you will need to keep a calm head and shoot your enemies. If that doesn't sound thrilling, then I don't know what does. Seriously more fun than most modern roller coasters.

There are several deep philosophical discussions present in the game, though since I do not want to spoil them for you I will focus only on one: imprisonment. At the core of the entire game there is a truth that lives with everyone. They are prisoners. Every citizen, every enemy, Elizabeth, even the player. Let me pose a question to you: if one wanted to be free of the floating city, how would they do it? There is no correct answer to this question, it was a trick. They are trapped in Columbia for the rest of their life. This game explores how a permanent state of imprisonment, and inability to become free, can change and mold a society. If you are curious how a society of prisoners living under the illusion they are free would grow, this video game is for you.

Paradoxical beauty is something that is difficult to put into prose, so bear with me for a moment while I turn to poetry:
Auburn sunrays sail the skies
warming buildings of all kinds
For above the Earth a city flies,
citizens restricted to its confines

And in this city of open lies
tread carefully around the fragile minds
Around the corner you hear their cries
as they pay homage to their shrines

If you thought freedom the ultimate prize
witness Columbia and its sinister design
For in this city you will be fine
should you submit to its unyielding binds.

Now, last but certainly not least, the politics. In all my years of playing video games, Bioshock Infinite has some of the deepest commentary you can find in any art. That's right, not just video games, but across all art. I do admit that at times it is not the most subtle of critiques but this does not hamper the effectiveness is any capacity. 

Early on in your adventure, you will wake up in ankle deep water in a church. You will hear a beautiful hymn as you collect yourself and try to find a way out. On your first encounter with another man, you will ask about your whereabouts, and he will respond, ""In heaven"". You will soon learn much about ""the prophet"", who seems an immensely important figure to the people praying. As you make your way into the world, you will hear the citizens make remarks about Columbia, all of them considering it the greatest, the highest, nation on Earth. You progress more, winning a raffle with a, in our modern eyes, disgusting prize: the opportunity to stone a couple because they are of different race. The game does not shy away from demonstrating how racist the populace is, as they cheer for the opportunity to stone the humiliated couple surrounded by racist imagery. What is all this a commentary on? It should be clear that it is early 1900s America, which I'm sure was obvious to the learned individual. In this review I cannot dive as deep as I would like into all the intricate details this game elegantly explores, because there is not enough space and I do not wish to bore you. 

Instead, I implore you to play this video game with a critical mind. I think it would be wise to do some background reading, I suggest the following: The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander, The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism by Edward Baptist, and The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion by Jonathan Haidt. Armed with only these books as foundational reading you should be able to fully grasp what Ken Levine and his team have managed with this game. 

Incredible. 10/10, take notes Rockstar."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"[b]Spoiler Free Review[/b]

My enjoyment of BioShock Infinite was not immediate, as the story starts out a little slow, but the deeper I got, the more I enjoyed it. The story, as well as the setting, was thought provoking from scientific, philosophical and social perspectives. I thought the voice acting and character development were fantastic, and the game was well worth every hour I put in. 

That's not to say it's a perfect game. The combat and movement systems felt a little dated for 2021, and the the auto-save feature is simply not good. As it's an older game, I think those are forgivable, but in the same light, I don't think you need to put down everything to play right now. If you can grab the game on sale, this story can make for a very enjoyable long weekend's worth of play."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,THE ENDING IS SUCH A BANGER WTF
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,the story is deep and as always with bio shock super intresting
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Cool story. Fun mechanics.

""Immersive"" is thrown around a lot, but it pretty much put me in the mindset that the story was driving. Would definitely recommend it to my friends, but they recommended it to me. It's probably best to go in blind like I did. 

Notes: Veteran at intermediate gaming. FPS is not my forte."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,Really atmospheric and has a good story. Very enjoyable to play.
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Ah, Bioshock Infinite. This game has a lot of changes compared to its previous games in the series, such as the weapon system, the vigor/plasmid system and even the movement system. But is it worth playing. Well let’s see. 
To start with, the weapon system. Anyone looking to play this game with the same weapon system as the other two games are gonna be disappointed. To me this felt like a bit of a let-down, I did enjoy the weapon wheel in the previous game, but I did manage to quickly get used to the 2 weapons only system, and that’s okay. In the DLCs “Burial at Sea” this weapon wheel makes a welcome return, but the DLC feels somewhat short, so I wasn’t able to fully appreciate this feature to its full. 
The vigors, the substitute of the plasmids, are quite nice and feel familiar but also fresh. There are 2 real ways of using them, a charge up trap or a one tap effect, much like the previous games. So, it feels fresh but some of the powers have been altered to give different effect that are a pleasant change. 
Now, down to the story. I have played this game before and a long time ago, and I hadn’t played the other games before. So, feeling the comparison between the games has been a nice experience to me. Because of this reason, I felt a massive difference between the complexity of the story. Whereas Bioshock one is a story of backstabbing and civil war, Bioshock Infinite is again about civil war but has other more extreme concepts, such as time-travel, dimension hoping and paradoxes. This is a massive change in complexity, and it is pretty confusing how much of a jump its taking between games. However, the story is non the less intriguing, maybe even more so. 
Overall, the game I still a good game, and is a good experience. I did enjoy it. But the changes from the previous games could be seen to make the game harder and less enjoyable for some people, but non the less the story is still very enjoyable and good, if a little confusing. The DLCs do make this game better too, in my opinion. Burial at Sea is very fun and much more like the original Bioshock game formula."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"The main storyline is interesting although like many others, I thought that the ending was a bit weird and forced. High paced combat and a cohesive aesthetic makes for a game that is easy on the eyes and overall i had a lot of fun playing the main questline and would probably replay it once more. The game does a good job fluctuating from a joyful disney-esque environment to a secluded, barren one. I got through the game in about 10 hours but I should have done some more side quests."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"In the last few months, I've completed the Bioshock Trilogy.
Bioshock Infinite is very different from the first two games. Not only the title is different, but the whole setting.
Your above the clouds instead of underwater, you play a different character, the color schemes are a lot brighter, etc.

+ gunplay is good
+ story is very good
+ visuals are still impressive (for a game from 2013)
+ I didn't experience any bugs

- too easy (just kidding, I recommend the highest difficulty. Normal difficulty feels like playing the other Bioshock games on easy mode).
- soundtrack could be more interesting (sometimes, for my taste)

I don't want to spoil the end of the story, but I warn you, it'll shock you. A must-play for fans of fps and story games (especially if you like the first two games of the franchise. However, I highly recommend to play them in order).

9/10"
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,3rd best game of all time!
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"[The following review might contain spoiler, i'll keep it as less as possible]
The third game of the series, compared to the previous games it have improved gameplay-wise, here are the stuff i liked about it:
-[Combat]First of all the plasmid/vigor, now you can actually use all of them without having to switch them out for others here and then, which allowed for better combat experience, combos and such.
-[Combat]Second would be the melee, its a small addition most people probably only used like once or twice in the entire game (lol) but it is really neat.
-[Combat]Third would be the skylines, that's probably the part i liked the most, it enabled some fun stuff during combat and such.
-[Combat]Some may not like it but i actually find the way of recovering HP much better in this game, not having to spend too much currency for purchasing healthpacks, plus it makes killing enemy more rewarding as you can get healing item from them.
-[Combat]Shield, this actually forces the player to play around cover a bit more smartly, although rushing head-on is still viable.
-[Combat]The wide array of weapon is really great, aside from the burstgun i actually find most of them quite fun to use.
-[Combat]Weapon upgrade is much more easier, allows more weapon upgrade and utility.
-[Progressing]The hacking has been changed to just using possess, which saved a lot of time spent on staring at the screen and getting zapped.
-[Progressing]The introduction of mini-bosses is done really well, i like them.
-[Progressing]Ammos are quite easy to come across and picking up ammos for the gun is automatic if you're holding it, pretty neat.
-[Story]I love it, if a potato brain like mine can process it anyone can.
-[Gameplay]Atmosphere for each area is great as usual.
-[Gameplay]If you pay attention to the background music you can actually notice when the comabt have ended.

Now, the game is great and all but i still got to pick a few bones:
-Firstly, why the hell does vigor upgrade costs so much, and to make it worse the coins aren't the easiest to come across either.
-Second, the Handymen, its practically impossible to shake them off in areas without a skyline, plus they can't be stunned like the Big Daddies. I do like the boss, but the thing is dislike is how they only appear like around thrice the entire playthrough.
-Third is the heater gun, either i missed something or some part, i didn't see a proper introduction of the weapon until i randomly came across it almost at the end of the game.
-Lastly, the gears. I know i can change them when you first found it, but where the hell do i get to view all my gears?

That's about it, idk why you would read the entire thing but here it is, only take this as a reference though since experience differs for each person.
Combat:9/10    Story:9/10  , buy it during sales its much cheaper."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Never expected that this game would be one of my favorites. The story is unique, characters with good development, excellent gameplay and a good balance on the difficulty. Haven't play the DLC's but I know they are good.

Totally recommend this game."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"The ending was a mind f**k
11/10."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Not as good as Bioshock 1 or 2. However, the DLCs are pretty alright"
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,Fantastic shooter with great story. People that are mad about the illusion of choice seem to not understand the point of the story.
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,Nah
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Finally made it. I like Bioshock 1 and 2 and I wanted to like Infinite so much, but it was so boring from the beginning to the end."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,Absolute masterpiece
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,Just impossible to play without getting a headache due to head bobbing.
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Bioshock Infinite is probably one of the best games I've ever played. The story was really good, and the characters are likable. The only critique I have is that the gameplay can get pretty repetitive, but its still a fun experience. I would definitely recommend this game."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"yea... this is poop. Bioshock 1 was AMAZING, Bioshock 2 was AMAZING. Bioshit Infinite is poop."
Counter-Strike: Source,Action,240,Door not stuck?
Counter-Strike: Source,Action,240,its been real
Counter-Strike: Source,Action,240,"Been playing since HL demo received with my 1st gfx card in the 90's (yes I'm an old git).
Have to say that Condition Zero still remains my favourite CS incarnation but as CZ (and the original CS) do not work any longer on Steam, the Source engine nicely fills the gap.
I have to confess that when it was originally launched I was not a fan at all of the source engine as it's bullet reg and general feel of the game was radically different the the CZ engine that I so loved.
That said after not playing the source engine for an awful lot of years, it has come along way in that time and has made big improvements since I last played and feels a lot closer to the CZ engine that I so loved.
It may be nostalgia talking but I still prefer CZ, but as it's not available anymore (well it is but doesn't even run anymore) Source runs it a close second."
Counter-Strike: Source,Action,240,Goldest and good game ever. since this game is Fun with Zombie and Deathrun Modes
Counter-Strike: Source,Action,240,"There is a reason why this game receives overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam. It is the best fps game I have ever played in my entire life. There are no words to describe how much I miss playing this game. This game literally started the fps genre in computer gaming. I spent over 500 hours of my time playing this game and I loved every minute of it. CSGO is nothing like it. I recommend this game to everyone. It is the best!

Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"Enjoyed playing this game! Tough at first, but eventually it will get easier once you get higher level weapons."
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"After having played Rise I find that I still prefer how most weapons feel in this game (other than switch axe and longsword I guess). 

I would not recommend using defender/guardian equipment for low/high rank because it pretty much nullifies any improvement you might have going through the game. 

There are several mods on nexusmods that improve quality of life as well and they're very easy to install (though I don't personally like HP/Damage etc. meters existing but ultimately that's up to you). 

I play on a 5 year old 970 and can manage 60 fps with mixed high/medium settings. CPU usage is where this game is a bit high though I think that has improved a bit since they removed denuvo.

During sales you'll usually save a bit if you buy the bundle with iceborne but if you aren't looking for a heavy time investment then base world by itself is still decent with challenging quests like arch tempered monsters, though they don't let you use the clutch claw/new moves unless you have iceborne which is pretty lame.

I recommend trying out every weapon in the training area and even looking up weapon guides because sometimes the game doesn't explain things very well. 

I don't really know why I waited so long to write this but I almost have too much to say if I really kept going. I've met a lot of amazing people and had a lot of fun over the years and I am looking forward to future installments and even future mod development for this game. I still enjoy it even after all this time which says enough I suppose."

Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"What can I say about this game that hasn't been told already? First of all it's absolutely mind-blowing and impressive the amount of options and attention to detail put into this game. The game is really fun and was a joy to play with my friends.

Kill za monsters and then use their body parts to get better weapons and armor and then fight better monsters and use their parts for better weapons and armor. This is the gameplay loop.

I'll be honest this game is hard , some of these monsters will open a can of whoop-ass on you and you'll just be sitting there crying on the floor. You literally cannot spam any of your combos on the endgame monsters , how do you beat the monsters then? You learn their moveset , and when they take a breather after a strong attack and find a window to attack and punish their dumb ass. But if you get too greedy the monster will punish yo ass. Learning the patterns , dodging and punishing at the right time , the game forces you to master a fight , and it's really rewarding when you are belting a monster than tortured you for 10+ fights.

There's many playstyles and weapons you can play in this game , like greatsword : slow af , big hits , insect glaive : you have a vaulting pole you can maneuver easy , lower damage compared to GS , long sword : weeb katana. There's many more and many things the game won't even tell you like jumping off mushroom ledges and new attack combos.

I would say , if you can play with a friend or a group of friends , go for it. I would say it's a masterpiece , story is bad , that's not what it's for , The gameplay is gawwwd. 

Thank you,
A fellow monsta hunta playa"

Dauntless is a free to pla- AHEM, monster hunter* despite its cost is a really awesome game,even better if you can find someone to jam with. it easily has hours upon hours of content if you don't just blitz through the story, and has a pretty lively player base too. i do have a piece of advice though, be careful looking online at stuff because there are spoilers everywhere, especially because its been out for 3 years."

Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"i owned the game on my main account. finished base game and also the expansion. here's my review:

pros:
game is really fun, even without the expansion you could experience a great monster hunting game. the game offers you to build your characters however you like, use weapons that you want you can freely change and alter your play style. hunt varies of monsters. 

cons:
the game doesn't have autosave that many game does. there is a save option on the settings menu and you get the option to save your game once you want to close the game."

Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,DYING IS GREAT
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"Okay, it's about time I do a review of this title... I'll put some tips at the end too:

To begin with, the game's performance in terms of FPS and stability is excellent. I have a ""mid-gen"" PC, I have invested in a decent graphics card (GTX 1660) and only with that I was able to experience Monster Hunter with wonderful graphics without going below 60 FPS at any time. I have to mention that the community created some MODS that can be -essential- for the experience of some, since they optimize the game in an extreme way. I totally recommend them, they never gave problems and they solve a series of problems that the base game has.

As for the game itself, its story is simple, but you can perfectly immerse yourself in the incredible world that it -shows you-, and I place great emphasis on that word, because the experience of this game is not something you can ""read"" or listen to. It is something you feel and explore through the Hunts you do, the places you explore, and the skills you perfect with practice. Your character is the center of this experience, of this ""story"", and as you progress you feel more and more as a part of the world, or as the game mentions, of the ""Ecosystem"". If you are a fan of deep and convoluted narratives, this may not be your game, but you should still give the experience a try.

The game's mechanics are what makes it stand out so much. Of course, 90% of your time will be spent in combat. The fighting is, to put it really simple, epic and frenetic, packed with action and activity. This only considering that you play alone (Which is totally accomplishable, since you have the possibility to progress through the entire game, all the fights and all the ""bosses"" in this way. And in some cases, it is even more fun.) . If you try multiplayer, even if you don't have friends in the game itself, a ""clan"" or ""party"" you can find a large number of players from multiple regions and experience levels willing to play in your hunts, this through the SOS signals, a mechanic that I really recommend players to use, either because you are stuck at some point in the story, or just because you want to have a good time with Randoms. In my 330 Hours of play I have never had a bad experience in multiplayer, the vast majority of players have a great attitude and if you are a newbie in need of a hand, be sure they will give you advice on what you need.

The difficulty is... subjective. I am not a great gamer, nor do I have experience with any genre of ""difficult"" video games, but still, I have had no problems progressing through the game. Yes, the different monsters have patterns, attacks and mechanics of which, if you don't pay their due attention, will punish you severely, but that is where the magic is, as you play you can begin to understand each monster, their movements, their attacks, their openings and where and when to dodge if necessary. The more Hunts you do, the easier and easier it will be to play, the better techniques you will develop and in the end, you will feel like in a movie, dancing on the battlefield. That is just very satisfying. And this leads me to...

The grinding. It is perhaps one of the most ""infamous"" or criticized features of the game and I can understand it perfectly. In this game you will be hunting the same monsters many times. The game presents you with a large number of them, each one unique, both in mechanics and difficulty, but you will always find yourself at the point of having to kill the same creatures over and over again, either because you want an armor set, weapons, pendant, etc. This can become tedious, very tedious. For example, I was already very advanced in the story and to make a very good weapon, I had to return 3 or 2 ""Tiers"" of monsters to kill an extremely weak version of an ""x"" creature only to advance in an extensive chain of upgrades until finally reaching the one I wanted. This can frustrate some people, and it may frustrate you too. But this is completely dependent on the player. As I have already mentioned, this happened to me, and although frustrating at the time, it was still entertaining for me, since I dedicated myself to guiding new players that were doing those missions for the first time. I entertained myself by explaining techniques, secrets or areas on the maps that would be useful to them once they progressed through the story. Sure, the combat was not a challenge at all, but the experience that a player would have considered boring and monotonous, I transformed into one that brought joy and energy to the experience of another player, in this way feeding the community that makes this game so special. It is just a matter of perspective and opportunity.

Another aspect that many overlook is the posibility of instaling MODS within the game. There is a very talented community of modders who create implements that transform the experience in incredible ways (or simple, like Skins, Textures or others). A big mention to the creators of ""Monster Hunter Stories"", an extremely fun mod that let you have your own Monster Pet! One that will provide you with assistance in combat too. The creators balance the experience, so you will still have to work hard to win, but it's a great option to give variety to your game if you usually play solo. But you have to consider something, DO NOT use it in multiplayer with random people. It's an unofficial mod and with this in mind there is a risk that it may not work after an update, or that it contains bugs. My experience went smoothly, but that will depend on the use and competence of those who take the risk to install the mod. It has a very simple on/off system once you install it tho, so you don't have to sacrifice multiplayer if you use it just occasionally


Finally, I suppose I will give some tips if you are a new player that would have served me a lot if I had known them before:

*) Look for the patches/mods to optimize your game, again, trust me, it greatly improves the experience.

*) Do not be afraid of the SOS mechanics, both of launching your own and joining some from the mission select. People will be willing to help you on your Hunts and they are (almost) always competent in what they do. They may not be professionals, but it is extremely difficult for a player to ""reduce"" the team effort (And you can always kick players out of your game, if you are that kind of person). And I recommend that you try to participate in that kind of calls. They're always available, in great variety, and it's a great way to experience multiplayer without having to join someone else's lobby.

*) Don't be afraid of any weapon in the game, I complete it with only the Glaive and I had no problems. There is some amazing ones and every one of them can Nuke everything. Just chose the one you think is the coolest and go on. You will get a hold on it in no time.

*) Be considerate of new players and consider your equipment compared to the mission you are helping with. Use low-level weapons in low-level Hunts. This way you can help and the newbies can gain experience and have fun too! Not everyone wants someone to complete the mission in a couple of seconds with a few hits and that's it.

*) On PC, if you want to edit the radial menu -the mouse scroll menu in the hunts- you can do it in the following way:

(Inside the game) [Esc] --> Item Pouch --> Item Bar [R] -default-
Once you organize that as you plase, you can save the ""set"", so you don't have to modify it every time you pick up an object. 
You do that in the following way:

(Look for your personal chest) Item Box --> Manage Items --> Manage Loadouts [X] -default- (there you save your set of objects and your radial menu configuration)
Why this Tip? I played 300 hours and completed the game before I knew how to customize that damn bar.

*) Horses and Monkeys can burn in hell. Kill them all. USE THE CLAW.

*) Godspeed Hunter"
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"As an ""OG"" fan of the series, starting on the original PS2 release back in 2004, there is no way I could not recommend the game to friends, or really anyone curious about it. The combat systems are in general the same across all the series, with little bonus mechanics added in/taken out of each installment. This game allows you the freedom of choice for weapons, and they all are absolutely amazing when played properly. Each one has specific playstyles, or even cater to specific groups of people. Of course, there are 'metas', like the Longsword and Bowguns, but that doesn't make the others any less viable. 

Of course, the MH franchise also has a great learning curve. I like to compare the combat to Dark Souls, as more people know/have heard of it, but with a lot more gradual, eased in learning curve. You're not just plopped into a 'tutorial' boss that'll mop the floor with you, you work your way up to those creatures, learning your weapon(s) along the way. It's really, REALLY well done for teaching people the combat system, and even the dodge mechanic. Even if it has way less i-frames than any dark souls, heh.

Last but not least, unlike all the previous MH games, World actually feels ALIVE. Open world maps, creatures that fight against each other and not with each other like all the past games, even the use of scoutflies is great. As the old way of tracking didn't make all that much sense to me personally (paintballs). Even invasive creatures interrupting your fight feels more natural, as they usually have turf wars, some of which are absolutely awesome (rajang vs jho). So yes, I 100% think everyone should at least try MH, if it catches their eye."
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"I see monster, I slash"
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,so good i bought it twice. just wish there was cross platform with playstation or xbox.
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"This game is not made for everyone I just want to be clear with that, this game could be very repetitive for some people because all you do is go hunting and actually hunt a monster (what did you expect) get the materials from it and then craft stronger gear, it also gets very grindy sometimes getting all the materials for a specific weapon but some material with low chance of dropping could be infuriating, getting used to the combat system in this game could be rather hard at first finally finding a weapon of choice all weapons in this game have their own playstyle, however I feel like some weapons take more time to master than others.

After all this should you buy the game?
The answer for me its an absolutely yes you will have a incredible time with this game despite being grindy af and if you got some friends to play with its even better

Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"Am gonna reveal the elephant in the room at start so I can focus on the other ""FUN"" stuff later. 
""An extremely steep learning curve"", which might be too much of an effort to climb for some players, and I understand, its completely normal.
The gameplay and rules of MHW take time to sink in. Even after 150 hours, there are things am still not aware of, which is one of the few problems of MHW. Leaving aside the core gameplay, you aren't taught much initially. But if you are a type of player who looks for instant satisfaction and fast progression, this might not be something you'd want to try. 
So here's the basic gist, you hunt/fight majestic monsters (not you Jagras), either trap or kill them and get loot which you later use for crafting gear. Yeah it sounds simple when I summarise it, but there's a whole lot of stuff you need to do before a hunt which the game doesn't teach you. There's a chance you'll find yourself confused after losing multiple times against the first real challenge, the commonly dubbed T-rex (Anjanath) and later realise this might not be your cup of tea. Yes I left the game after that. 
In short, you need to be patient. Things take time you know, you can't expect to hit the bullseye on your first attempt. That's the time I made up my mind and returned back. Things changed this time around. Yup....now comes the good part. 
The beauty of MHW are....the Monsters, DUH! No, that's not what I mean. Each Monster is unique, has its own behaviour, its own set of moves, weaknesses and overall identity. Once I realised that it's not just the hunt, its the fact of investing the time to learn about each one of them, their habitats, their nature, are they clam or straight up adamant. When I started analysing them, reading about them, going on expeditions to track them and researching further,  I unconsciously developed the role-playing factor. And my god, thats the hook. Next thing you know, I wake up in the morning thinking about how to prepare myself from Tobey Maguire's electric tail whip attack. Leaving aside the eagerness to explore and wait for new Monsters to show up, the loot is super rewarding too. 
The moment you slay and Elder dragon (Albeit I feel sad watching such a beautiful creature die, yes you Xeno'jiiva) you can't help yourself but wonder what does its armour look like. And am guaranteeing you, you'll be jaw-dropped amazed 4 out of 5 times. Once you figured out the core hunting techniques, progression gets quicker, you get better gear, craft stronger weapons, you learn to prep better and use the right skills and items, which is when you start to feel more accomplished and satisfied after each hunt. One very game changing factor is playing multiplayer. Taking down a Monster with your fellow mates, planning, strategising, the overall thrill.... its really fun. If you can convince your friends to tag along, that'll be something I'll highly recommend. 
Anyways, those are the fun bits of MHW, it takes time but when you get hooked, you learn to appreciate it, you uncover more things, customising your room, catching rare pets, etc.
MHW has a very well designed core gameplay loop. This altogether keep players engaged and allows them to try new things. There are no dialogue choices, the story is linear and every players goes through the same journey. But the RPG factor is how each player differs from the other, from having their own personal favorite weapon to their mindset during hunts; are they more of a ranged hunter, or a trapper or a support unit. These are the things that affect the experience. It might not have as many diverse choices as other complex RPGs but its a more simpler approach and something that needs to be appreciated.

Few problems...the silent protagonist, uhmm, no relatability with the player which kinda sucks for an RPG. The over all narrative too, very casual and something that isn't done well. And this is a personal thing, after 100 hours, once you have taken down all the Monsters, the gameplay gets really repetitive. Unless you have the DLC which keeps you engaged for another 100 hours. 

Although I've given the game a thumbs up, and 60 percent of my review is a bunch of criticism, the game has some issues and honestly those do seem discouraging initially, but the true wonder of Monster Hunter takes its sweet time to be discovered and its this particular factor which makes me believe that its one of the good RPGs out there and a must play for hardcore RPG lovers."

Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"An exemplar game with the best of the best gameplay loop, accompanied with stunning visuals and soundtracks. This game is the pinnacle of what a game should be and is a must play for anyone looking for a fun time.

[b] The objective of the game is simple - take down the giant monster specified in the quest. [/b]

Underneath this simple objective however, lies a complex puzzle portrayed as an elaborate dance with you, the player, and the monster itself. All 14 unique weapon types drastically change how you would approach a fight, and with each dance against the monster, you sooner or later learn when you can exploit its openings. [b] This is the bread and butter of this game. [/b] 

Words cannot describe the amount of euphoria you can feel after you finally conquer a monster you were constantly dying to, all because you finally learnt and adapted your playstyle for your dance against this monster. All these experiences are further amplified by the breath-taking graphics and soundtracks which can send shivers down your spine.

I have played every Monster Hunter installment since the PSP days, and the devs have done a phenomenal job improving their franchise, removing a lot of things which put off new potential players before, and adding in new mechanics for players from their previous Monster Hunter titles.

Please play this game. Solo is fun too but playing with friends makes the experience even better!"
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"This game is amazing in testing your skills, adaptability and patience."
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"i remember first try playing monster hunt on ps2 then i amaze with the monster and mechanism of how you beat the monster dont forget the tension when you met the dragon as a kid XD and 15 years later i can bought this game,  maybe its too late but it was worthed.
Hunting and collect some drops for crafting its just fun, especially the graphic it was really cool now.
I hope this game continues to update in steam/pc platform so i can play more"
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"I have played around 300-400 hours of MHW on the PS4, and recently got this game on the PC. 

I now have 500 hours on the PC.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone questioning whether to buy it or not."
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"So being honest what I liked the most about this game is that it's simple. Whenever someone asks me what the game's about I just say ""you beat monsters with a stick"". Nothing too deep about it, just raw fun. Also, probably the best online community I've ever seen. Would recommend to anyone, 10/10."
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,I like this game but I don't like the Alatreon
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"A very long time ago I got this game on Playstation 4, I completely hated it... Although, I did play sword and shield the first time around (I hope any sword and shield players take full offense to that.) I kind of forgot the game existed for a few months after that until a friend messaged me over discord asking if I have ever played Monster Hunter World, he eventually got me back into it. Something I will never take back is that I am glad he did, because this game is a f*cking masterpiece. 

At the time of this review I have used every weapon (except sword and shield) twice. I have made 4 characters all with over 100+ hours on them. This game offers so many paths with weapons and abilities that my 772 hours on this game is just scratching the surface of the potential you can get. This game is just fun plain and simple. If you love beating the absolute hell out of monsters then I can not recommend this more, if you like monsters fighting other monsters then this game is for you, there has been a countless amount of times where I have seen a walking pickle that breaths dragon blight inducing smoke throw a obese lizard into the side of the wall breaking everything in its body... (maybe a little gruesome) BUT IT HAPPENS! You like getting up and close? Slam a hammer into their face. You like staying back and supporting? we got you, riddle them with bullets or pelt them with arrows while you got a healing build on your armor. Maybe you are all about that ranged and close ranged action, oh yeah man we got you, go up with a gun and pump em full of shotgun rounds as your other teammates beat the living hell out of it with pointy sticks. There is never a dull moment in this game, and EVERYBODY no matter their play style will find a weapon they like in their runs. But that is just weapons! The story in this game is phenomenal (no spoilers). It is very rich and fulfilling once you finally kill your first elder dragon that seemed impossible to even scratch. No matter what you are looking for, maybe just a nice playthrough in a monster hunting game, or maybe you want to go into a huge raid party and take down a gigantic nuke spitting dragon. No matter what you do in this game, every second of it goes toward something. I can not recommend this game enough for everybody, if you want a good game then you need this in your library. Also if you like the base game then I assure you the DLC is very worth it.

Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,this is a great game graphics AI and the monster desigh is good aswell but starrting out with defender weapons just made the game a bit to easy the only time i ever lost a story mission was near end game and it only happend twice then i beat the game so defender weapons just to strong to the point theres no need to craft new weapons

Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,Love the game so much I recommend it to play this game hunting monsters
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"This game became Capcom's best selling game ever for a reason. With changes to make entry for new players easier, yet retaining the things veterans of the series loved Monster Hunter World was the catalyst the series needed to make the community boom. Whether you want to play solo, have friends to do multiplayer with, or even with randoms you will always have things to do and ways to keep improving."
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,I like Monster Hunter but I can't play it because it makes me sad to hurt the cool monsters. Especially when they try to limp away. It is too much.
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,eating is my favorite activity
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,Kill big monsters get killed by bigger monsters
Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,ass game tbh

Arma 3,Simulation,107410,30 hours in and I still haven't learned how to play this game. I will update at 100 hours.
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,u can preten 2 b reel solder!
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,Was the only game I'd play for over 4 years. That should say enough.
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,I mean I got 1000 hours in it now soooo I guess its fun. Just dont expect to have that fun without a good group of people to play with. This is a community based game and it kept alived by said community. Be prepared to be social.
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,A military sandbox game with incredibly modding and community support. The physics engine can act up sometimes but beyond that the entire game is a pleasant suprise. Great singleplayer campaign and many Multiplayer hours possible.
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,This game has a lot of potential. The big killer for this game was the enemy a.i. They spot you from a mile away even if you are crouched and moving slow. They shoot with pin point accuracy and will hit you even if taking cover behind rocks. They don't even take time to work out where the shot came from or take cover. They just turn on the spot and start shooting straight at you. If the a.i was fixed then I would give this a go again in the future.
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"This game has violated me so much, I am starting to mistake it for love."
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,one of the best mil sims ever made if not the best.
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,Honestly I had been waiting 8 whole years to play. as soon as I had a PC strong enough to run it and it was on sale (just in time) I picked it up and put 123 hours on it in less then a week. Love it <3
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"The physics and client performance are definitely jenky as heck but I am willing to accept those two things considering how amazing this game is at heart. If you are looking for a solid military simulation game with a ton of mod potential, this is as good as you're going to find."
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"The Definitive Military Simulator + The Definitive Vietnam Simulator all in one nice package, very slow paced, very immersive, always fun"
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"If you're looking for a COD game, pass. Arma 3 is very realistic and you die a lot, at least for beginners. Great with mods, though I haven't tried Multiplayer. Singleplayer campaign is okay, but the scenarios and editor is where you'll spend most of your time alone."
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,Nice carryall nerd *yoink*
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"awesome game
"
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,couldent find a sever for 3 hours
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"The game in a nutshell :

Time spent playing 20%

Time spent Barbing (playing dress up)in the arsenal 80%

10/10 would play military dress up again"
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"This game is so much fun. Vanilla or modded. There are so many options to choose. If you play Garry's Mod or have in the past. YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME TOO. The possibilities are endless. In my top 5 along with Minecraft, GTA 5 and Garry's Mod."
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,Best played on the weekends. Some missions require time.
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,Great Game Very Very Pretty I Have A Bad PC And It Can Still Look Like A Million Bucks
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"* Get owned by elite russian snipers
* Play dressup (for men)
* Fly plane
* Crash plane
* Go broke on dlc"
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"Well seeing as its the Arma franchise's 20 yeah anniversary i should probs write a review. So here goes:

Pro's

The sheir amount of teamwork in this game is unrivaled. From just 1 squad working to capture 1 objective. Too a  commander making several squads + 2 transport helicopters and a tank platoon work together.

Its a sandbox combined with a FPS. This is great because you can make literally anything in this game. If you can script in this game then the sky is the limit.

The sheir amount of mods that have been built up over the years. For example want to play DCS but dont have the money? Just download a the F-18 super hornet with a almost fully modelled cockpit. Or the fully modelled Apache and Blackhawk. 

The game engine is a funny of its own. Ever wanted to kill a tank by sending it to the stratosphere? Well just grab a quad bike and go full speed ahead.

Most computers can run this game. Yes i said it i do not care about the FPS argument, just turn ur render distance down. Someone in the community that i play with uses a 5 year old school laptop to play the game and he can clutch with his machine gun like a god. The only thing that will be bad is ur frame rate and graphics but hey who needs frame rate, its Arma after all.


Cons:

Your experience in this game heavely depends on the community that you find. Do not go for one of the hardcore milsim units is my advice, go for one of the casual or semi realism units. These are usually the best. I myself have found a nice casual unit that is the most fun experience ive had in this game.

Its a large scale game wich can make new players feel quite lost at first.

If you want to have a heart attack then try to open the controls menu. Although all these controls can be nice for experienced players, for new players its the number 1 complaint. 

Good luck and have fun!
"
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,Vanilla sux. only play it if your going to mod it.
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,The game is good and now I hate my self because of it.
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"Once you take the time to get use to the controls, and customise them to your liking the game is absolutely amazing! It could use some optimisation, but the only game that rivals your freedom of movement in Arma is Tarkov. Escape from Tarkov is too much of an MMORPG for me to enjoy lately, and the armour system needs some work, but that's where Arma fits in. Something realistic with a good movement system. I have only played singleplayer content so far, but the squad mechanic is very good. Reminds me of Operation Flashpoint. Also, do recommend the Vietnam DLC"
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,Mil sim with a-10 go brrrrrrrrrr
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,gun go pew pew

Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"This is literally the greatest mil-sim to ever exist. A lifetime of content and an abundance of things to do alone, with friends, or with fellow soldiers across the globe. Buy it. Play it. Love it."
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"AEZsxrdctfvygbuhnjimk,"
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"Hemtt and hatchback is hot, not to mention ifrit."
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"Its worth it just for the mission editor. It has endless possibility. 
However, Its best played with friends."
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"Awesome game for a milsim and overall very fun to RP military operations in 
"
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,game is good but its useless when you have no squad to play with
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"Arma 3 is by far one of the best games I've played. It is like the military version of Garry's Mod, The modding Community is so great and massive for Arma 3 that if it isn't in the game already you can bet that it will be made eventually. While the game was released in 2013 it still holds up and the Creator DLC definitely brings new life to it. I'm looking forward to seeing how Arma 4 will be and hopefully will continue the legacy of Arma 3."

Arma 3,Simulation,107410,Best play with friends and groups plus the 7 years of Workshop made by the Community.
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"I accidentally got sucked into the world of Arma 3 and now I can't stop.

This game has too much. You have too many options in terms of weapons, vehicles, locations, factions, and the list goes on. If you have any interest in virtually any aspect of military sim, then this game has it, I promise.

(+)I spend most of my time in the Eden Editor which gives you the ability to create your own wartime scenarios. From dogfights to hillside ambushes, you can make it all. Maybe one day I will actually upload something I make but for now its all in good fun.

(+)The multiplayer is what I feel most people come for when it comes to Arma 3. Playing with a squad of friends definitly is the best way to experience what Arma 3 has to offer, but you can still rely on the community to play a fair game and that leads me to my next point. 

(+)The community is one of the best I have ever encountered. I don't know what others have experienced, but I was quite surprised at how helpful and fair the majority of my encounters with randoms have been. This to me is a huge plus.

(-)This game has its negatives however. Graphics, for start, have the ability to look ""pretty"" from afar or in some situations, but overall, the game looks dated (but you have to remember that IT IS DATED). I wouldn't have much of a problem with it but the issue I do hold against Arma 3 in regards to graphics is that the game runs like shit. This game is notorious for the god awful frame rates and this really holds true once you get into large scale battles. I have a pretty good rig and I usually hold 60-80 FPS out of combat, 40-60 in combat, and anywhere from 10-40 in very large scale scenarios. This is unfortunately a reality many of us Arma users have to face. To give you an idea, I have seen a $1650 computer run this game and only go below 60 FPS in those crazy large scale battles.

(+/-) This one can be seen as either a positive or a negative depending on what you are looking for. This game has a stupid number of controls. You have the ability to go as deep or as shallow as you want with them depending on how complex the scenarios you get yourself in, however everyone who starts out playing Arma 3 usually makes or breaks during the ""control learning phase"" which can easily take anywhere from 10-30 hours to get muscle memory for.

Overall, its a good game and I think you should make the purchase. What? That's not enough? Isn't this why you're here? So I can tell you whether or not to spend your money? BUY THE DAMN GAME
"
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"Very good! 
Campaign is enjoyable and hectic at times which will get the heart pumping.

Arma 3,Simulation,107410,The multiplayer is epic
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,funny game big pog tigris op :(
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,its not for the people who do not have are not good at waiting for long periods of time bet once you start playing it just kind of pulls you in and it helps you with making friends cause your always doing stuff together and making plans.
Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"I tried it and its taken way too seriously for me and far too hardcore. In one server it felt like I was scrum at bootcamp being literally yelled at. I told them f* off its a game not real life and left. So unless you are into super hardcore multiplayer games with communities that go way too into a game (suprisingly this is more toxic than world of tanks), and you don't like singleplayer, probably not for you. 
With that said Campaign is a lot of fun so far, very much looking forward to reaching Contact campaign which looks and sounds amazing. And I added a few mods too. Not very many mods, but they add a TON to the singleplayer experience and makes singleplayer perfectly playable (and more enjoyable than many singleplayer games)

Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"Best military simulator period. Lots of different types of game modes from coop to pvp to rp etc. Its always a different experience when you join a different server. Well worth the money. My only gripe is that this game WILL TANK YOUR PC. Doesnt matter what you have in it, it will eat up your fps. Adjust settings to your liking. Dont expect to run this game at 60 fps constantly. This game is CPU heavy."

Mount & Blade: Warband,Strategy,48700,"This game saved my life.

I am 60.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realise that.

Thank you"

The base game is good, plenty to do, has a decent play through and to actually conquer the map fully whether as a vassal or a kingdom ruler it takes a lot of hours. I'd definitely recommend as a minimum to download the Floris Mod for this. Lots of visual improvements and additions to the base games. If you like tactical games which you really need to grind to succeed in then this is one to try."

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"When I first got the game, I liked it.  Then I met the first mini-boss and died a lot.  I got better.  Watched quite a few walk-throughs and tips videos.  I hated everything about it.  The I-frames, the enemy fight timings, the death mechanics, the Ogre...oh! that damnable, stinking ogre!  I never hated a character more until I had to fight Lady Butterfly.  Then about 20 hours in, I just got it.  I understood.  Then I was able to appreciate the landscapes, the quests, and the story line. I got my platinum in about 43 hours.  I've played through about 38 times, conquered all DLC gauntlets, and still love playing it.  I can now do a full run through in about 10 hours if I play all the side quests and kill all there is to kill.  Still hate the Headless though.  1007 hours and still love it.  I probably can't play anything else that From Software has now, but that is okay.  I'll still give the Souls series a try at some point.  Looking forward to Elden Ring."

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,there are monkeys in this game
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]
This is the first title from developer [b]FromSoftware[/b] that has really caught my interest and after checking it out, I found myself investing a large amount of time enjoying all that it has to offer. [b]Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice[/b] has everything I would want in a video game: an awesome story, amazing combat, and a wonderful world to explore.

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]A wonderfully crafted story tied to an amazing world to explore
[*]Fantastic enjoyable, and fun challenging combat that will make you feel like you are in a sword fight
[*]Unique [b]Shinobi Prosthetic Tools[/b] to utilize to help you in sticky situations
[*]Eye-catching graphics that are just beautiful to look at
[*]An amazing soundtrack that fits the late [b]Sengoku[/b] Period theme
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]The issues were so minor that they did not meddle with my experience
[/list]

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story starts out in the late functional [b]Sengoku Era[/b] near the end of the war when [b]Owl[/b], a master [b]shinobi[/b], comes across a small child on the brink of death on the battlefield. He decides to rescue the child and call him [b]Wolf[/b]. From then, over the next 20 years, he trains [b]Wolf[/b] in the way of the [b]Shinobi[/b].

[b]Owl[/b] assigns [b]Wolf[/b] to protect his young master [b]Kuro[/b], who is a descendant of an ancient bloodline that has the ability to grant immortality. Three years later, a rival clan captures [b]Kuro[/b], wanting to take advantage of his ability for their own benefit.

During [b]Wolf's[/b] attempt to rescue [b]Kuro[/b], he is defeated and left on the ground with a severed arm unconscious. After waking and understanding his situation, he meets a Monk who supports [b]Wolf[/b] by providing him with a prosthetic arm and also confirming that [b]Kuro[/b] is still alive. Equipped with a new [b]Shinobi[/b] prosthetic tool to help him on his mission, he sets out to rescue his master

I love Sekiro’s story as it is crafted wonderfully with much to unravel. There are many mythological references, which I found very fun and interesting. I also appreciate the use of colors throughout the environments that are tied to Japanese culture.

Not only is the story great, but the world itself is full of mystery. There is so much I want to know about it, from the locations, to the characters, enemies, bosses. It’s like every character teases you with a hint of a backstory that makes you curious to know more about them.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Have you always wanted to know what it feels like to be in an actual sword fight? [b]Sekiro[/b] does this greatly. When facing off against enemies you will see a stamina meter called [b]Posture[/b] that builds up each time you damage someone or deflect their attacks. Once it fills completely, your enemy will be stunned and be unable to move for a short period of time which opens an opportunity to attack. Be careful though, as they can do the exact same thing to you, this adds in a strategic element.

When you defeat enemies or bosses, you obtain EXP ,which you can use to level up, earning you more skills for Wolf to use in combat. When an enemy or boss's health bar has been depleted, you can perform a [b]Shinobi Death Blow[/b]. This is a finishing move that I recommend doing frequently, as you are invincible while performing the move.

Combat can get quite challenging as enemies will have all sorts of tricks up their sleeve. However, you must learn to master the fundamentals of [b]Sekiro[/b], learning the mechanics and flow of the combat. As soon as you master the controls, [b]Sekiro's[/b] difficulty can be very manageable, allowing you to feel powerful and in control of the combat experience. You should have such a feeling of pride after figuring out their mechanics and patterns.

There will be times when you will die in combat, you are not out of the fight, as [b]Wolf[/b] can revive himself. Sometimes if timed rightly, you can use your extra life to get the drop on enemies for a surprise attack. This really keeps you on your toes to pay attention to your surroundings.

[h3]Shinobi Prosthetic Tool[/h3]
The [b]Shinobi Prosthetic Tool[/b] is a device that will help you on your journey throughout the game, with a variety of uses. It comes equipped with a grappling hook, allowing you to reach higher areas which can sometimes be used to grapple onto bosses for close melee combat. You can also obtain other tools to assist you with the prosthetic, like a [b]Shuriken[/b] (Throwing Stars), a [b]Flame Vent[/b], and a [b]Loaded Axe[/b]. My favorite one has to be the [b]Shinobi Firecracker[/b] as it stuns enemies for a few seconds, which I found very beneficial on most of the bosses. You need materials to increase your tools effectiveness, which you can gather by killing various enemies.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2482799391
All of these require [b]Sprite Emblems[/b] to use, which are collected as you kill enemies throughout your journey. Another way to get them is by spending [b]Sen[/b], the currency system in the game that is dropped by the enemies that you kill.

[h3]Shinobi Arts[/h3]
There are several skill trees that you can choose to put your skill points on, to help shape your play style. I chose [b]Shinobi Arts[/b], which focuses on stealth tactics and is perfect for those who prefer to do things quietly. You can get a variety of useful skills like the [b]Whirlwind Slash[/b], [b]Mid-Air Deflection[/b], and [b]Shadowrush[/b]. I highly recommend getting the [b]Mikiri Counter[/b] as it is one of the most useful skills in the game, which will help build your [b]Posture[/b] quickly. This seems to increase the stamina meter quicker than most of the other defensive skills that you get.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2482800147
[h1]Graphics, Performance, and Soundtrack[/h1]
[b]Sekiro[/b] has to be one of the most beautiful games that I have played. Each area is crafted wonderfully with bright and colorful environments that transition very well into darker gloomier ones, keeping a fresh pace as you explore the world. This helps to show us that not every area is full of bright colors, and that there are some darker corners of this world. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. I experienced no issues while I was playing and sat at 60 FPS with no slowdowns. You will need a decent computer to run this game, at max settings, though.

The soundtrack for [b]Sekiro[/b] is really fitting for the late [b]Sengoku[/b] period that the game was aiming for. Some of the songs really catch the moment when you initiate combat with an enemy or boss.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
[b]Sekiro[/b] is truly amazing! I have never played anything like this before, having everything that I would want in a video game that executes everything it wanted to accomplish expertly. This has made it to my list of simply perfect games out there. I’d even recommend [b]Sekiro[/b] at full price as there is just so much to experience, adding good replay value to try to experience it all.

Though once you understand to play Sekiro the way Sekiro wants you play it, it's one of the best games all around.  10/10 GIT GUD."
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"An exceptional game if you are a fan of similar From Software style games. 

This game is not meant to be approached in a form of Splinter Cell style stealth nor is it supposed to be a head-on assault, where you easily slay hundreds of foes. Sekiro is about finding the most efficient way to dispatch your foes. Balancing the mastery of combat mechanics and the limitations of stealth, Sekiro is a game that will demand your focus the first time through and then demonstrate your own improvement from the very beginning of NG+.

Steel yourself, the learning curve can be steep and the early hours of play can be frustrating, but this new style of gameplay is a welcome addition to the ""Soulslike"" genre."

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"buy, best souls game i've played. (sekrio, ds1, ds3)"
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"This review is just my opinion, what i say on this review is entirely up to you whether you get triggered or not.

Sekiro is one of my all time favorite games. i'm only on my 4th NG+ run through. and boi do i still love it even though i know what to expect. This game was my first souls like game and i have completely fallen in love with every mechanic there is. the game challenges you on reflexes and memory. each boss i feel teaches you something, a certain mechanic or a playstyle. learning to use the prosthetic tools correctly and when to use skills. i remember baby raging at almost every boss because it was my first souls-like game and i didn't know how the hell to play it. Sekiro is a commitment game, it isn't something you're just gonna be good at. its a one of a kind. and its up to you, the player to stick through it and learn how it works. The games story is amazing if you don't just skip through all dialog, the animations for fighting makes each swing and parry feel so powerful.

Ive played abit of Darksouls 3 and while i haven't finished it i cant really say much. *but Sekiro is literally harder than Darksouls. sue me.* But im not gonna sit here and compare DS to Sekiro.

There is some downsides to Sekiro that do bother me, like the ogre to start with. We can all literally agree hes literally broken, Not working as intended. When he leaps at you, you HAVE to step back and jump otherwise hes gonna 120 quick scope your ass. Secondly the punishment for using healing items. i understand its an intended mechanic but its pretty toxic tbh. 

If you're looking for a game that will challenge you and make you question your own sanity, play it. Its gonna be hard at first, especially if its your first souls like. But as ive said it takes commitment and time to learn how this game works. you learn to not be so panicky when you fight bosses or certain enemies. Combat feels more fluid and cinematic. You feel like you are watching a movie. At least thats what its like for me. i don't usually think about what im doing anymore when i play. Would i recommend this game? yes absolutely. It didn't get GOTY for no reason. Personally, this game is better than any of the souls games. Its learning curve is higher and there is no build to carry you. You have to learn to carry yourself with your skills. There are multiple endings that i still haven't gotten to yet and i'm still loving it. 

TL;DR If you suck you're gonna hate it, keep playing. When you ""git gud"" you'll love it. 

I give this game 10 Shinobeeyeee out of 10 rage quits."

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,i wish i could die as often as i do in this game.
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"One of the most beautiful, detailed, engaging, and satisfyingly-challenging games I've ever played. Sekiro tells an incredible story as well as provides tons of replay-ability, souls style. Once you begin to understand and eventually master the severe difficulty, the game feels that much more fun and rewarding. This may be my favorite game ever. Every rage filled moment was fun and well worth it (especially final boss).  <3 this game 

P.S.
Don't know how, but Demon of Hatred was harder than final boss and Midir (DS3)."
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,This is the Dark Souls of ninja games with gameplay that makes you feel like Batman.
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"You don't need to know my opinion of the game at this point - this is one of the most frequently reviewed and discussed (singleplayer) games of 2019.

Personally, though, I've enjoyed Sekiro more than Dark Souls or Bloodborne, trading away community/multiplayer elements and varied RPG minutiae for a more cohesive set of mechanics focused tightly on reading enemy body language, choosing and timing your responses - then throwing in a dash of stealth and a selection of useful but diverse ""subweapons"" in the form of Prosthetic Tools.

It feels largely more focused than some of From Software's other games, both having an extremely tight mechanic set that isn't weighted overly towards one playstyle (or method of combat) than another, and with more clear goals inherent in both in the narrative and general level design."
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,This game is amazing... and I hate it.
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"This game might be one of my favourite games to date. The combat is satisfying and only gets better as you progress through the game. Once you have every upgrade/combat art its like a different game. The boss fights are all difficult in their own way and extremely satisfying to defeat, even after multiple play throughs. The guantlets are interesting boss rushes to do once the story has been completed, with the last boss being a tuned up version of the old boss with new move sets, grinding out these have been frustrating and enjoyable, clearing the Shura guantlet was the best experience i've had in this game.

10/10 lemme restart again"
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,honestly only playing it cause i spent $80 on it but its still pretty fun ive died as many times as ive jerked off
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"This is one of my all-time favorite games. The mechanics are a bit hard to get down at first and very hard to master. But once you get the hang of it, this game becomes an absolute joy. Replayability is a huge aspect of this game. With multiple endings and a lot of collectables, you'd have to play through the story at least 4 times to get everything (endings included). If you love Soul's games with a twist, this game will quickly top your favorites list. Just make sure you practice the mechanics before you rage-quit for good. Trust me, you'll rage a lot at this game, but it's worth it in the end."

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"Amazing game, anyone that says otherwise needs to ""git gud""."
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a brave innovation upon the vastly popular Souls formula. This brings the natural risk that Sekiro could perform very badly in some regards when compared to its ancestors, and threatens to alienate a number of the developer's diehard fans. FromSoft's willingness to do this shows an incredible amount of confidence from the developer, and even though there are a number of issues I have with this game, it is still undeniably a fresh, exhilarating and fantastic title that I feel comfortable recommending to any fans of challenging action titles. 

I'm going to start with a lot of my issues with this game that hold it back from its incredible potential. 

The first major flaw of Sekiro is the way that levels are designed. Typically, it will be a fairly compact area with a horde of enemies patrolling, with a number of hiding spots and weaknesses to be exploited. The intention here is a sort of dynamic difficulty, where more skilled, confident players can take the large groups head on, whilst players struggling more with combat in the game can utilise stealth to carefully pick the enemies off.  This idea is noble, but the issue is that neither method ends up being rewarding because stealth is unreliable and badly implemented, feeling more like cheating than skilful evasion, and fighting large groups at once is frantic, frustrating and too often involves exploiting the poor enemy AI or using cheap hit-and-run tactics. The combat is crafted to work incredibly well in combat versus a single opponent, but levels are crafted in such a way that makes these gratifying combat scenarios rare and artificial. 

My other concern with this game is that it doesn't do enough in the way of variety. The first half of the game is extremely homogenous in its level design and theming, and even after this there are only a couple of zones that effectively distinguish themselves in enjoyable ways. Minibosses and bosses are often reused and reskinned to the point where there is a shockingly small number of distinct, wholly unique and high-quality boss encounters, at least when compared to the rest of Souls.  If we then count the number of boss/miniboss encounters with truly unique, distinct fighting styles or strategies, it's easy to see that Sekiro is limited in scope in this regard. Add to this the fact that Sekiro can only ever wield one weapon, and your moveset (aside from consistently underwhelming Weapon Arts, Ninjutsu and Prosthetics) never really changes throughout the whole course of the game. 

But what makes Sekiro still a great title and well worthy to sit alongside its FromSoft peers is its combat system. Sekiro fixes a lot of the issues of the other Souls games by adding more responses to enemy attacks. In Dark Souls or Bloodborne, your response to most enemy attacks is the same; dodge roll.  Sekiro still has this as an option but the invincibility frames are so low that this is only a valid response to certain attacks that call specifically for it. The now default response is to Deflect, a move that requires commitment, good timing and risk. Individual attacks might also call for a Jump or a Mikiri Counter, but crucially, most moves are so dangerous that only the correct type of response is sufficient.  By making this the case, it means that the player is rewarded for playing in risky ways because there is no one move that can avoid almost all attacks to be used as a crutch for the player. In addition to this, the fact that enemies can recover their Posture if left alone for some time further encourages aggression.

This all but forces the player to play in the most fun way, frantically dueling the bosses on their own terms, requiring the player to master the fight rather than simply finding a cheap tactic to exploit. It is also such a grand departure from combat in earlier titles that it avoids the issue where the game is too easy for those players, essentially resetting their muscle memory and leveling the playing field, giving both newcomers and Souls veterans alike the same feeling of progression and journey of mastery that this game rewards.

Sekiro is not a perfect game, and will not be accessible to everyone, but combat is so well-crafted and rewarding that it carried the game all the way through to the end for me. That FromSoft were willing to depart so bravely from the formula that had carried them to such grand success, and that combat in this game is such a wonderful foundation for this thrilling experience, allows me to overlook much of the flaws of this game, and gives me great continued confidence in this developer."

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"Pain, but in Japanese."
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"I've put a whole heckin' lot of hours into the Souls series, from Demon's Souls on the PS3 to Dark Souls Remastered to Bloodborne. I broken sword'ed the Asylum Demon; I got the Bell Keeper set; I bullied the Orphan of Kos; I killed False King Allant with a Quality Dagger when I put all my points into Intelligence and Luck because I didn't know what the actual hockey sticks I was doing.

Point is, I've got a fairly broad range of experiences with From Software games, so I feel like my opinion is justified when I say that Sekiro is the most polished, well-constructed game that From Software has put out thus far. A lot of people may be turned off by the tighter scope of the game: There's no real character customization to speak of, and your primary weapon against your foes will always be a katana. That being said, Bloodborne is pretty universally renowned for being one of the series' best, and it only has a handful of weapons and options for playstyles. Sure, it's nice to be able to sculpt the face of your character into your own likeness, (or more likely into a magenta-faced abomination with a spongebob nose) and running around with the Hollow Demon's Ultra GreatSpatula +7 that you grinded for 8 hours to get sure does look cool (even though the scaling inevitably is garbo), but From Software did an excellent job of trimming those design aspects away and I honestly never felt like Sekiro was missing anything as a result. Most everything in Sekiro is there because it [i]needs[/i] to be, and there's very little fluff to speak of. The combat is fluid and rewarding, and the difficulty ebbs and flows in conjunction with how you learn to handle your opponents. Sekiro's combat rewards player skill far more than stats or upgrades, and as a result it is far, far less common for you to wind up smashing your keyboard because you just got bullshitted to death by some janky hitbox or unavoidable mob of enemies.

On that note, most enemies [i]are[/i] avoidable. With the introduction of stealth mechanics, probably around half the enemies you encounter can be snuck up on and stealth killed (this applies to minibosses as well), and since you play as a ninja, you can pretty much always rely on running faster than your enemies can chase you. So in that way, Sekiro is a far more relaxed experience than Dark Souls, since you don't need to worry so much about slogging through 47 black nights on your way to the fog door, or picking up that rare Kitchenaid Titanite Shard. The bosses may be more difficult, but they all kill you through skill moreso than fuckery. Many still are weak to specific items or tools, and you can pretty easily guess when and how to use them if you use your brain noggin head thing (except the spooky gorilla, because who even would've thought about poking him with [i]that[/i]).

Play thoughtfully and carefully and you'll pretty much always come out on top, and then you'll go back and breeze through the boss rush modes because this game has trained you into an LB smashing machine. (Also did I mention there's a boss rush mode post-game?)

Also you can pause the game now. 11/10 with divine rice"

The atmosphere and music really pull you into the world alongside the design of the characters. The dialog is very well done allowing you to believe they are almost real. Overall, This is one of my favorite games of all time. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the souls series and anyone who is looking for a starting place."
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"This game is an absolute MASTERPIECE, but is also meant for GAMERS. Do not bother purchasing this game if you're just looking to play a casual story driven game. This game DEMANDS time and absolute focus. You will spend hours and hours exploring and figuring out where to go in the vast world, and even more getting completely manhandled until you finally get 1 of the many mechanics down to get thru a certain fight. If you love that feeling you get after you continually beat challenges that keep owning you, then this is for you. If you love seeing how much you've progressed by going back and beating those challenges again, then this is DEFINITELY for you. I personally felt more gratification after beating this game than Dark Souls, which is a statement.

DO NOT expect this game to be like Dark Souls aside from the difficulty, and how the save system & ""souls"" system works. Unlike Dark Souls, this game actually requires complete mastery of the combat mechanics versus rolling your way to victory. The combat is definitely grueling to get accustomed to, but is easily one of the most fluid combat systems out there once it clicks. It's actually incredible how much better you realize you've gotten during your 2nd play thru. From banging my head on the wall against Lady butterfly for literally 5-6 hours my first time, to one shotting everyone thru Genichiro in under 3 hours the next. It's an extrrrrrreeeeemley gratifying feeling to see how far you've gotten.

There isn't much else to say on it because the story, graphics, design of the world and all the baddies you'll slice on the way will speak for itself. Just know what you're getting into, and that it takes an incredible amount of patience and dedication to get accustomed to the flow of the game. But once you do, you'll understand when everyone says they just have a moment where it ""clicks"""

The only issue I have with the game is the loading times, it causes the immersion and whatever you're doing in the game to be deducted. Kinda wish there was no loading times, did I mention I hate loading times? 9.5/10"
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"If you've never played the original Half Life before, then definitely pick this up.

This game takes full advantage of the Source engine and cranks it up to 11. It fixes all of the shortcomings of the original game and makes them better. Even Xen, which were disappointing final levels in the original, looks gorgeous and won't dissapoint in BM.

Definitely pick this up if you're new to the Half Life series."
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"Black Mesa facility part is very good. It shows that a lot of effort was put into this project. 

However, the Xen part is questionable to me. 
I've waited for the Xen part for 8 years & what I got was an immensely good looking reimagining of the original version.
The Crowbar Collective took a bit too many liberties though & changed things for the better or perhaps worse in some cases. 

For me, it was the latter. 

- Xen is overstretched into oblivion. Half of it could've been cut out & made it just slightly longer than the og version. 
- Similar to the first point, puzzles get repeated way too many times & most of them feel they are deliberately designed to prolong the sections. (i.e. multiple shields spinning around you need to shoot, Controllers having shields that are fueled by crystals you need to destroy...)
- Music doesn't fit Xen. The alien world is suppose to feel... alienated & creepy to you as you are the only human alive wandering around the xeno-world. Original had perfect atmospheric sounds & great ambience. The music is also very repetitive & irritating after a while.  
- Scripted sequence like the Gargantua escape is very odd & feels out of place. You run away from the first one & then conveniently the others are waiting in the caves for you to pass them & the last bit before you are launched by the alien pod, about five of them appear as a 'tense cinematic experience' or something. 

So, overall, I wasn't satisfied with Xen at all. Way too scripted & less natural, unlike the og version.
It's up to you guys to try it out yourselves.

Black Mesa,Action,362890,"This felt like playing Half life 1 again for the very first time. Brilliant remake that changes the game to how you think you remember it while expanding a lot of areas and fixing some issues with level design. Even familiar set pieces and locations were changed so it feels fresh and exciting to reach them. 

The big highlight of this remake is the complete overhaul of Xen. It has been completely redesigned to the point its nearly unrecognisable from the original game. Xen is one of the best looking areas i have seen in a game. My only real issue with it is Interloper. Its still bad but for a different reason. Its too drawn out and gets extremely repetitive especially towards the end and i wish they had made it a bit shorter instead."
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"Always a Halflife fan, since back in the day. Great redo of the game."
Black Mesa,Action,362890,The start is a little slow and exactly like the first game which is great but the real Gem is the alien world which is completely different and a real treat to explore - really worth doing the first part.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"[i]Black Mesa[/i] is perhaps the only competent remastering of the classic [i]Half-Life[/i], bringing a well-deserving game to future generations.

With this game, I wasn't exactly sure how to feel about it, as it is a very unique project from the outset. A different developer entirely was working on the remaster of a decades old game and [i]Valve[/i] gave them the go ahead to release it with their support. Personally, I had a lot of qualms with the previous remaster of this title, [i]Half-Life: Source[/i], because in remastering it, the game lost some of its stylistic nature and it overall did not do enough to warrant purchasing the game with so little really done to enhance the experience. With ""Black Mesa"" on the other hand, it is a definite graphical upgrade, making the game appear as though it was on par graphically to the sequel, [i]Half-Life 2[/i]. If one were to pick the original up today, the subpar visuals and dated limitations would scare plenty of possible players away, but with such a competent re-release done by developers who clearly cared about transporting the original's experience to the modern day, it is apparent the job was well done.

After finishing this game, I will admit I did hold a bit of an issue with it within myself. You see, for 80% of the game, the contents of [i]Black Mesa[/i] are identical to [i]Half-Life[/i], but after the player makes their way to the [i]Xen[/i] chapter and onward, they are met with an artistic redesign of a majority of the alien home world. Now, graphically, it is stunning and clearly what a fair amount of the budget went towards getting right. Depending on your initial thoughts of the late game from the original, you may have welcomed this change with open arms, but personally and thematically, it feels off to say the least. Sure, the details like introducing slave-driving into the alien society would have been fitting for the sequel, but for this game it felt out of place because that was not the thematic focus of this title and therefore it feels like it is trying to amend the lack of hindsight for [i]Half-Life 2's[/i] ambitions by implementing these half-heartedly to fit the overarching narrative of the series, but as I said, it just falls flat when sat down next to the rest of the game. I would argue that though these redone sections of [i]Xen[/i] are more thought out than those of the original game, they stretch the game out and the pacing ultimately suffers for it.

Would I take [i]Black Mesa[/i] over [i]Half-Life[/i]? Well, it really depends on my mood and if I want to take advantage of the improvements and added mechanics of this remaster or just want to go back and relish the classic. I would have to say that I still believe the original to be the better release overall, and really, I would probably say that for most originals over their remakes unless they take the style into account throughout the transition and have objectively better enhancements that make the previous entry pale in comparison. Though I had fun with my time in [i]Black Mesa[/i], I am not adverse to going back and playing older releases even if it means I have to deal with dated features, therefore [i]Half-Life[/i] is undoubtedly the game I prefer to go back to. If you are unable to deal with dated functionality, however, than this game cuts out all of the slack and gives you a modernized and close enough replication of the taste the original has to offer.

Black Mesa,Action,362890,"I played the original Half Life in 1998. Back then it was on a family computer and (due to the impressive performance of my machine) at a reduced resolution of what seemed like 320 x 320, leaving a huge black space around the outside of the monitor.

Despite those shortcomings that game left a deep impression on me as one of the first true FPS games. Not only excellent in overall game design and technical genius but plot and story as well.

That game still holds up today, but of course is lacking in areas we take for granted in modern games... and polygons of course.

This game however is a faithful recreation of this ultimate classic. A true gem of what can happen when fans come together to bring this loved game to a new generation who will be able to appreciate it.

Black Mesa,Action,362890,"To give some context : I'm 39 and I played Half-Life the year it got released. Really loved the game and it stuck in my memory as one of the best game I ever played. By the time Half-Life 2 got out, I didn't have a decent PC anymore and never played it.
This was followed by many years of sporadic casual gaming on rather old consoles. Basically, I never played any games after the Xbox 360. That's to say I'm not used to play to top-notch 2020 AAA games in 4K.

So, fast forward to present days. I recently signed up for a Geforce Now subscription and stumbled upon this ""fan made"" Half-Life remarke while browsing through compatible games. What a great opportunity to replay a game I loved back in the days, right?

One last thing, description said guys who remade the game completely modified the last part : Xen. Good, as this was by far my least favorite part of the game. I remember this final chapter as short and pretty pointless.
So here I am, playing Black Mesa in glorious 1080p60 with all graphic sliders to the max. 

If you read it so far (thank you), here are my thoughts after finishing the game in 22hours (contains Spoilers) :

The good :
- The game is looking good and of course runs at a steady 60fps, just like a cleaner version of the game as I remember it
- It immediately feels just like in my memories. The story is cool and there's this weird sense of humor. You really get into the story and feel you're part of it
- The puzzles are ok, easy enough to not get boring
- The weapons are very well balanced and combats in open areas are really good despite basic IA
- The new ""Xen"" chapter is almost a new game on its own, divided in sub-chapters. I was very surprised by how much extra length it added to the original game. It also goes further into the alien world and how far the whole scientific exploration went before the incident. The whole thing is really impressive and the level design of this part is incredible

The less good :
- IA is outdated and scripts are basic. But you might actually like it as an old-school feature if you're getting old like me
- The last chapters, despite adding a whole lot of content to the game, ended up getting too long for me. There's a sequence mixing puzzles and jumps that is just way too long without adding anything.

My conclusion : Definitely worth reliving this adventure if you enjoyed it a long time ago. The new graphics makes it easier to dive into and the added content is really an impressive piece of work. Supposedly it helps connecting the dots with Half-Life 2. That's what I'm about to find out right after.

Black Mesa,Action,362890,"Black Mesa is not only a true love letter to one of the biggest games ever made, but also a prime example of how the gaming industry should be. It is a perfect recreation of the original Half Life. Everything from that game is in here, many times in improved ways.

Gameplay: While feeling modern, it retains the same fast paced style that defined Half Life and the old school shooter from the 90's that you rarely see today. The remake of Xen is impressive, expanding and improving in every way its original concept
Graphics: I honestly can't believe Source is a 20 years old engine. There are a couple of times in the Xen levels in which there are FPS drops but if that's all you'll have to pay for a game to look this good on an engine this old, then I'd say it is a really small price. Black Mesa is certainly not the best looking game ever but there are plenty of times in which it doesn't just look ""good"", but actually beautiful
Sound: As immersive as it should be in a game like this. Also, the soundtrack by Joel Nielsen is one of the coolest aspects of the game. It is memorable, atmospheric and catchy on its own whlie still retaining the style of the soundtracks for the Valve made HL games.

However, probably the most important thing about Black Mesa is what it represents. The gaming industry isn't what it was anymore with big companies, triple A games, cosmetics, microtransactions, professional competitive scenes, etc been the rule. You can clearly see how Black Mesa was made by HL fans for HL fans, keeping everything that made the original one great while also improving in aspects that weren't necessary to get people's love, yet they did anyway, like an MP mode, necessary tweaks to some levels, a soundtrack that feels as one made by Valve, etc..."
Black Mesa,Action,362890,Excellent remake of the original. Have played Half Life a dozen times. This still is refreshing with so much new stuff included.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,play this while you wait for half life 3
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"Nostalgia! yeah!

What I didn't realize before hand is that this is more of a puzzle game than perhaps a shooter game.
Anyways, was a fun ride to the end, if at times a little frustrating."
Black Mesa,Action,362890,it has better graphics and better guns looking  HQ bad guys are good looking and new PUZZLES SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO A EASY ONE A HARD ONE INSTEAD and the the final chapter is amazing and the crowbar
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"A true masterpiece!!! 

Black Mesa not only stands worthy to the expectations and the heavy name of the original, but at the same time it shows us aspects of the story that we have never seen before! 

Successfully recreating a legendary game like Half Life is a trial itself; Further expanding it’s story (even a little bit) in a compatible way? Well that’s a work of art… a new experience.

And that is exactly what makes this piece so good. BM isn't simply the Half Life of the 21st century, a decent remake with better graphics, sounds, etc. It’s not THE GAME made better. Truly nothing can be compaired with the feeling of nostalgia that comes with playing the original title.

No this one is quite different. BM is more like Half Life of an alternative universe. A game that still holds some secrets... where Xen was never so unknown before!

 Highly Recommended!
"
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"This is not a remake, this game is re-imagined. I really loved the Xen! so alive, beautiful and enjoyable. I have played Black mesa long back when it was just a mod and then it was released on steam I immediately purchased it hoping to get XEN. After looong waiting we finally got it . When I played through whole thing then I realized ""Oh! that's why it took so long to release XEN"". It was totally worth waiting for it.
Thanks to creators!!!"
Black Mesa,Action,362890,Nice Remake!
Black Mesa,Action,362890,sooo good super nostalgic its a must buy for any fans and non fans just try it out good game mechanics and really good detail and graphics
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"So I just finished the game. 
On ""Black Mesa difficulty"", what ever that means. 
I did it blind-ish, I only played the original Half-Life about 15+ years ago. 

And man am I impressed, they did a fantastic job. 
Though some points do seem a bit forced and backtracking has been cut down on from the original, that's a bit unfortunate. 
For some sections I see why they did it, but I feel they should've kept it more open to backtracking like the original. 

Then I got to Xen and my mind was blown! 
Such beauty! I could marvel at it for hours and have, as it was also MUCH longer than the original. 
The extra lore details from what we now know from Half-Life 2 and episodes, also were beautifully done. You really felt sorry for the Vortigaunts. 

The numerous  puzzles were a bit questionable in Xen though, I sometimes felt I was just running from puzzle to platforming to puzzle with platforming. 
But if you're remaking something so much longer than the original, that can happen."
Black Mesa,Action,362890,I grew up on garry's mod and hl2 graphics so trying to play the original half life was actually a strain on my eyes. I'm also a younger gamer at 14 so I tend to play new games and in comparison half life graphics were really bad just because of what I'm used to. I'm 4 hours into Black Mesa and I love it. Super atmospheric and some cool little new details compared to the original game. 100% recommend it!
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"If you like the original Half-Life, then you will LOVE this game. Would prefer this game than the original, and I'm a nostalgia nerd, so that's saying something. 

Make sure you play this with a good computer/processor, my Lenovo Thinkpad 2.0 couldn't handle the optimal graphics and either made it slow, or just the screen would be so dark it was unplayable."
Black Mesa,Action,362890,Brilliant game and great reimagining of the original half life
Black Mesa,Action,362890,A great game in its own right. Played the original a few times but wish you could get the thrill of playing it again for the first time like it's 1999? Then this is ya very well priced and very faithful re-imagining.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN"
Black Mesa,Action,362890,Such an amazing remake! Xen has been entirely rethought - i was not expecting that at all! amazing 10/10
Black Mesa,Action,362890,Seems  there's  some kind of lighting glitch whole game was way too dark.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,A remarkable remake of the original Half-Life which on it's own is still a solid FPS title and a staple for any fan of the genre. 10/10. Would recommend.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"Is good, just as HL1 was"
Black Mesa,Action,362890,It's a masterpiece.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,door unstuck
Black Mesa,Action,362890,0/10 doesn't feature the funny hunt down the freeman protag
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"I would personally say this is the definitive place to start the Half-Life series. They made Xen such a beautiful place, and you can clearly see the amount of effort made by this team."
Black Mesa,Action,362890,the best way to play half-life 1
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"You know how remakes are always inevitably worse than the original? Yeah, this is the opposite.

Black Mesa's remastered graphics add a new layer of immersion to the experience. The minor tweaks to the weapons, along with improved enemy behaviors, make the combat a little more satisfying than in the original. Although I do miss the original HL1 soundtrack at times, Black Mesa's OST is a more than acceptable stand-in.

I'd strongly recommend for both fans of the original Half-Life, and new players alike."
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"what are you waiting for?
JUST BUY IT"
Black Mesa,Action,362890,half life but better
Black Mesa,Action,362890,I you want the half-life 1 experience in HD graphics then this is your game
Black Mesa,Action,362890,Quite possibly the best remaster/remake of a game ever.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,I've had a hard time playing as my laptop is not really up to snuff.  Just added additional memory with hopes it will play better and be more responsive.  I'll let you know how that works out!
Black Mesa,Action,362890,This game is a work of art.  It belongs in a museum.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"This is such a great game, so much detail and care has gone into its creation. To be able to relive old memories from the original version to now having this, which has been fleshed out has been great. Really enjoying the game play and the environments. Fantastic!"
Black Mesa,Action,362890,Very good and (mostly) accurate remake of the original game. All the chapters in xen are just so much better.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,In the test chamberrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Black Mesa,Action,362890,What an amazing addition to the half life universe. Fans of the original will feel the nostalgia pouring through with new twists and turns to keep you engrossed. A must play for every fan.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,You really should play this.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,I love this game. Big thanks to CC for making it happen! So so good.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,the best remake of the best game! 20000/10
Black Mesa,Action,362890,If this game broke my back I would still love it.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"Its such a pain in the ass to configure and when i want to change a setting, the game locks up and i have to force close every single time. its great that we got this game remade but gosh its so unstable."
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"""So, Blackmesa, we meet at last. Please, don't think that I've been avoiding you, a great many matters require my attention in these... troubled times. I do hope you understand, and now I require a further indulgence on your part. I cannot close my report until every loose end has been tied up. The biggest embarrassment has been Black Mesa facility, but I think that's finally taken care of itself..."" 

Great game to revive the Half-Life experience with (amazing) better graphics"

EA and Respawn don't respect their playerbase enough to alleviate this issue. They'd rather keep selling you the game and hope you don't notice."

Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"[b]CONDITIONAL RECO[/b]

As the news says  this games multiplayer component is where this game shines. Unfortunately Respawn and EA see fit to ignore their growing and avid playerbase and not improve or harden the match making from scumsucking hackers who destroy it in every way possible. they knowingly sell a broken and unplayable product. Currently, do not buy because the multiplayer is FUCKED. If the DDOS issue is fixed i will change this review but I sincerely doubt it with EA and Respawns current Track record with fixing games that are not the current social circle jerk or their garbage shilled sports games.

[b]BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK PILOT[/b]"
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"My very honest review. Do I love this game? I did. Do I enjoy playing the game anymore? Not really.

Titanfall 2, game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by EA was probably the best FPS game I have played in my life. It's a quick paced shooter with all the actions and variety weapons and skills to try out for different game styles. Although all these unique perks and weapons exist, the one that really stands out on the spot is the movement features. Wall runs, double jumps, grappling hook, adrenaline, bunny hops, and slide runs. Being able to fly around the map feels amazing, you know the kind of feeling you get when you watch the scene from the movie ""Matrix"". It has such an amazing concept for a video game.

So what made me dislike the game? Hit detection and server issues. You see, if you are a part of the Titanfall community you know about the downfall of Titanfall 1. The horrible server issues make the game unplayable and even make the hit detection absolutely horrible. As usual, I'm not skilled at playing games but that won't excuse the disabilities the game is receiving. What I'm saying is, it's an outdated game that the developers did not give enough attention to. Today I finally snapped and built a massive frustration inside me. You could be asking, ""Maybe it's your internet?"" Please, I think having a 1GB internet from Korea is enough for me. When I connect to multiplayer, the game notifies me that I will be having 32 ms ping in Tokyo servers but when I'm put into a match, I have over 150 ping. The game is currently unplayable.

Anyways pros and cons,

Pros :
- Absolutely stunning gameplay mechanics
- The freedom of movement you can barely see in other games
- Decently optimised
- Loved the campaign
- Variety of perks, variety of weapons

Cons :
- DDos
- Server issues (especially in Asia)
- Hit registration/hit detection
- Cheaters in Hong Kong and Taiwan servers
- Resolution issues
- Quitting may sometimes leave a black screen
- Melee mechanics
- Requires third-party software, ORIGIN

I really really do love this game. I would even have considered it as my favourite FPS game. But from it's current state? It's a waste of penny because you cannot play the game. You just cannot and if you get targeted by the DDoSer, you will never be able to play the game anymore. It might be outdated but I hope the devs would look into the situation and give more attention to this game.

P.S. Don't buy it."
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"Honestly one of the, if not THE best first person shooter to come out to this day. I know that I only have 3 hours on here, but I had THOUSANDS of hours on Xbox, I was the #1 Ronin main! The story is short, but ever so sweet, the first time I played through it I shed manly tears. The multiplayer is AMAZING, with different modes and skills. It is a very easy (and fun) game to play, but it's hard to master. The agility is smoother than butter, and for that reason alone I would recommend this game, but there is so much more! There is no hesitation, buy this game now. 1.500/10, would ABSOLUTELY recommend!"
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,This game is good and I like pizza.
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,BRO YOU NEED TO TRY THE CAMPAIGN IT IS AMAZING AND THE END IS JUST- JUST PLAY IT

Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,Help i am being chased down by a monarch for my AA batteries great game.
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,Very good and well designed campaign
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"A rather simple story, yet emotionally impactful and an iconic duo may I add. The gameplay is plain legendary and easy to get into but hard to master, the combinations with the abilities and the weapons along with it give you the impression that you're a badass even when you don't exactly know what you're doing. Each mission feels unique and has it's own little twist that makes them all a blast to play. The multiplayer I played only for the achievement so I don't have an actual say in that but the 2 matches I played were pretty good and overall balanced. The achievements were fair and I got to say it's one of the most COMPLETE games I've ever played, that left me satisfied from the start until the end."
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,This game is a masterpiece
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"This probably is my favourite game in a while since the first time I played The Last Of Us.

-Campaign-
Story: 9/10
love the link between BT and Cooper, Throughout the game the duo improve their trust and they show it in some examples such as at the beginning of the game BT calls you Pilot but throughout the game you go through more and more BT calls you by Cooper, In fact the whole story between the two is all about trust with BT in some sections saying ""Trust me"", It's also cool seeing other pilots in the story such as the 6-4 and some old characters from the old game and the multiplayer such as Sarah Briggs and other characters. It's a 9/10 because I wished they fleshed out more of the story and give us a sequel.

Mechanics: 9/10
Minor spoilers for one of the missions in the single-player but you arrive at the location of a fallen militia pilot named Anderson and obtain a time-travel device found on his corpse. Probably the most memorable mission I've ever played since it's so unique. 

For the Multi-player side of the game there is a lot more diversity, I personally use the grapple hook since it's the one utility that requires practice and it's so much fun finding the tallest structure in the map to use it as a slingshot target. It's so much fun since you require the the camera to change the direction, pitch and yaw of your movement. 
There are other utilities such as Cloak, Pulse Blade, Phase shift, A-wall and Stim.
All are great but they only can be used for players who like to use them to their full potential.
I'll leave a short explanation of each of them.

Cloak - Used by Cooper in the single-player, Creates a cloak for pilots that makes them barely visible but not to the point where other pilots can't see you

Stim - Gives the pilot an injection of speed which can be used for wall running, the more speed you obtain the more the stim will multiply your velocity. Also brings the perk of healing the user.

Hollow Pilot - Creates advanced clones of the pilot that follow the last thing the user was doing such as sprinting, walking, crouching and sliding.

A-wall - Portable shield for the user that blocks bullets coming towards it but the user can shoot through the shield, similar to the particle shield on the Tone titan

Pulse Blade - A dagger that is throwable and creates a radius near the blade that shows Titans, Attrition and Pilots on the map and gives them a silhouette on the user's screen (Enemy players can see that they are being detected by a pulse blade) 

Phase shift - Similar to cloak but slightly different, When the user uses the shift power they can teleport to an alternate dimension that shows the map in a darker look. Users that phase shift at the same time can see each other but cannot interact until they leave the phase shift dimension.

All of these abilities/ utilities are great but I haven't used them too much.

A bit of background of me
I started playing Titanfall 2 during the Tech Test since I was kinda dried out from playing non-stop Grand Theft Auto V on PS4. I heard Titanfall 2 was coming to PlayStation and I remember the title name from older Vanoss Gaming video. In the few days I had to play I enjoyed playing the multiplayer of Titanfall 2 and how the gunplay works with all the different abilities. Fast forward a few months to the release, I forgot about the date the game was going to be released since there wasn't to much advertising since the game was launching inbetween Call of Duty Infinite Warfare and Battlefield 1, I have to agree with the community with how EA just threw this title aside since they didn't want to distract everyone with one of their biggest titles.
I wish there were more advertising towards the game. I managed to pick up the game maybe a month after the release and I've enjoyed it since.

I moved to PC since I didn't wanna pay for PS+ any longer and the grapple hook works better with a mouse."

The titans feel like part of the player I don't feel like I'm at a disadvantage when I am on the ground going against a titan. The campaign is refreshing and a real treat to play, honestly it has been one of the best fps games I have played in a long time."

And to top it all off, a heart-wrenching ending. I feel empty right now. I haven't even played the multiplayer yet, but I'm excited to. And all this for usually $5. It's a steal, and it's terrible that the shitstorm of EA is completely abandoning this masterpiece. If you know how to appreciate a game, top of my list on recommended games."

There is a threshold to climb for new players for sure, but after playing the spectacularly good campaign I still felt well prepared for the mulitplayer.

Buy the game, and stand by for titanfall!

Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"Absolutely one of the best games of all times. 
Does it have the best campaign, no. The best story, no. The best player base, no. So what makes this game good? The movement.
No matter whether you're above everyone atop buildings, or down in the trenches with the titans the one thing that keeps this game going is how easy you're able to move through it. From a grapple, to a wall run, to a bunny hop through a window and back to a wall run, no matter where you are, you will be able to get out in just a couple seconds.
And it's this freedom of traversal that keeps me coming back, that keeps me playing despite constantly being killed by people who religiously play this game daily for the same reason as I do.

If you want a game that is uniquely different for it's game play, a fun game to play with friends or a chill six hour campaign, Titanfall 2 is for you.

Oh yeah there's also big robots you can call in from the sky and pilot, but that doesn't really matter."
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"managed to keep me engaged almost the whole time. Its very well made and the mechanics are very fine tuned. The game is extremely polished and while most will play it for the multiplayer, i think that the campaign is one of the best in first person shooter history. The combat is fast, hits herd and is extremely satisfying. My only complaint is that the campaign is very short. It can be completed fully in about 6 hours. Because of how short it is, there is very little character development outside of the main two characters. Other than that its an amazing game. I give Titanfall 2 a strong 9/10."
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"Honestly it's a great game that amazed me from start, I come from Apex legends and I also was blown away by the experience present in Star wars: Jedi Fallen Order, keep it up Respawn Entertainment and congrats for your oscars win for the first time in the history of video games."

Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"Titanfall 2 is one of the best first person shooters to date. 

Yet it is unfortunately plagued by many factors that are not directly it's fault. Which has lead to it being vastly under rated and under played. But I will discuss these later.

Titanfall 2 takes the gunplay from [i]Call of Duty[/i], adds one of the best movement system to date, and of course; Titans. You play as a 'Pilot', a near superhuman elite soldier and a significant force in their own right, who has the special right to call in and pilot their Titan. Titans are heavily armed, heavily armored bipedal mech walkers, which is bonded to it's Pilot. It can fight independently, but is strongest when Pilot and Titan are united. 

The gunplay is similar to [i]Call of Duty[/i] (Some of the Dev's used to work on CoD). Weapons that have low recoil, high firerate, and high damage. Because of this the 'time to kill' is very low, often less than a second. Gameplay is inherently very fast and rewards quick reflexes and good aim.

Pilots are incredible mobile. They are outfitted with a 'Jump-Kit', a series of thrusters, anti-gravity boots and various other devices that cover their entire body. This allows them to double jump, slide, ignore fall damage, wall run, and move at incredible speed through the battle field. The primary purpose for this is to avoid enemy Titans. Pilots are incredible vulnerable to enemy Titans, their weapons being able to reduce a Pilot to paste in one shot. Direct confrontation with Titans is therefore unwise, so Pilots prefer to use their high mobility to flash through the battle field and stay to the roof tops and/or indoors, places where Titans cannot go. They are not completely at the mercy of Titans however, Pilots carry Anti-Titan weapons and can do serious damage to Titans from hard to reach places. The movement system is relatively simple and easy to learn, but allows for extremely fast and precious movements with proper mastery. In my opinion, it is the best overall movement system in any game that currently exists.

Titans are the poster child of this game and a significant part of it. You often start a match on foot as a Pilot, with your Titan having a build meter, that increases passively, but killing enemy Pilots or Titans will add a large chunk to your meter. Once at 100% you will get to call in your Titan, it's will be launched from orbit to where you called it in too after several seconds (this process is called [b]Titanfall[/b]). Unlike Pilots, Titans are very durable and the time to kill is much longer. Their firepower is significant, extremely lethal to Pilots, and capable of cutting through an enemy Titans heavy armor with ease. Unlike Titanfall 1, Titan's cannot regenerate their shields (in multiplayer), so damage take is permanent, and the Titan will eventually die even to chip damage. Another change is that Titans in multiplayer are now set classes, with their own weapons, ability, ultimate, role, and theme. Their are 7 Titans; 
- Ion (energy based). 
- Tone (mid-ranged explosive shooter). 
- Ronin (close range weeb). 
- Northstar (sniper, and can hover). 
- Scorch (fire, area denial). 
- Legion (big gun).
- Monarch (one man army). 


This game also has an actual Story Mode (unlike Titanfall 1), and it's actually really good, though a bit short. The game has many levels that take advantage of the Pilots mobility in fun and creative ways. Their's also a good bond between the games protagonists, Jack Cooper (Pilot) and BT-7247 (Titan). Good chemistry between the two and some emotional moments. Overall a very well done story mode, way better than it had any right to be.    

Multiplayer is good, though a bit hard. Various modes but the main mode is Attrition, which is 6v6, Pliots and their Titans along side AI forces. If PvP multiplayer isn't your thing, their is also a PvE coop mode, called Frontier Defence. 4 Players vs several waves of AI soldiers, Titans and various other forces. The objective is to destroy them all and defend the 'Harvester'.



Now to talk about the negative factors I mentioned earlier:

1. EA/Origin. Unfortunately, this game's publisher is EA, which is already bad, but it also means that you have to use Origin. Requiring an Origin account and Origin client software installation. The game cannot function without Origin so there is no way around this. This is by far the biggest issue, and something you're going to have to accept if you want to play the game. Worth noting that the Origin version used for the Steam version of Titanfall 2 seems to be a 'lite' version, and hasn't caused me many issues. Unlike the full version of Origin which is prone to crashing.

2. Small Player base. Due to many factors (that I don't fully understand), Titanfall 2 has a small pool of players (2000-6000) at any given time. Match making times can be several minutes. It also has little to no skill based match making. It is fairly common that a new player will be paired with a G100 Veteran and get destroyed. This isn't always the case but expect that most people you play with will be experienced, and this game has a very high skill ceiling.

3. As the Dev's focus on [i]Apex Legends[/i], Titanfall 2's development is mostly dead. Don't expect any new updates any time soon.

4. Minor issue, but when the game launches it's a bit odd. The green 'Play' button on the Steam Client goes Blue (indicating it is running) for a second then back to green. Then Origin opens briefly, then the game opens for real (play button goes blue again). Some issues with this; 1. The game always opens in Windowed mode, even if you set it to Fullscreen. You have to manually set it to Fullscreen every time you launch the game. 2. Sometimes Steam doesn't sync properly after Origin opens briefly, resulting in the game opening, but Steam doesn't think it is (Play button is still green), and can't uses Steam overlay ingame. Only way I've found to fix this is to simply restart the game and hope for the best, some times multiple restarts.



Overall, Titanfall 2 is a very good game, but it requires you to put up with several issues and EA's annoying client. 

If you're willing to put up with that, I'd highly recommend Titanfall 2. If not, don't."

IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON BUYING THIS GAME FOR THE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER ASPECT TEMPER YOUR EXPECTATIONS!

EA has neglected and dropped the ball with Titanfall 1 as of late, the game is literally unplayable due to hackers (reportedly a might be a single dude manipulating the online matchmaker and the cloud server) and this guy has come to Titanfall 2.

EA will do nothing about this. Do not play this expecting any multiplayer stability."
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,he he titan go brrrr
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,holy shit this shit good if you want a game then this is defenatly the right game
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,It's great when it's working. I Like the concept of the game but I wish I knew about the ongoing on and off  DDoS attacks on this game before I bought it.  And it seems unfortunately Respawn have done little to do something about it.  Look it up on YouTube.  The problem seems to be ongoing all the way back since the original Titanfall.  So much love for this game by the community.  So unfortunate.
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,This game is amazing.
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,RIpoFF of Apex... Two Thumbs Down
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,If Apex had a father this is it
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,Its an amazing game but the servers are impossible to play on. Sometimes its decent but i mostly stay above 90 ping in every game. I hope they upgrade them or something soon.
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,gud gaem. please dont use pilot sentries
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"this game gives you what you want 
quick gameplay with cool animations that does not ruin your match with alot of other cool stuff. 
the storymode is one of my favorite. simple cool with no repeated missions, every chapter is a new thing, a new gameplay, new experience 
the multiplayer tho is good as the storymode alot of titans alot of weapons 
the most thing i like about multiplayer is that a titan and pilot are equal 
cmon man you should get this"
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"Really fun shooter, with a decent story arc. Titans are very fun to blow everything up with as well."
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,Well i defenitly recommend the game but i phyiscally cant play it in long bursts. A week at a time is really the best. Its a good game but its just hard to get actually good at
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"really nice game, lets make titanfall2 online great again"
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,Most underrated game out there
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"Great game, definitely worth playing in 2021."
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,Buy it or I will steal your bones
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"Titanfall 1 was my favorite game of all time after mechwarrior games lost their charm. Titanfall 2 is absolutely mech compared to T1 with prefab titans yuck. However both will become entirely unplayable due to one specific hacker with a grudge and extensive knowledge of Respawn's infrastructure, thus being able to readily counteract any measures the Devs try to take against the hacking. But in short, the hack causes serves to fill with gamertags or usernames that are thousands and thousands of characters, which T2/T1 only allowed usernames of about 16 characters by default, this force of super long usernames actually makes T2 flip out and the servers crash. To my knowledge this is why you cannot get into a game on T1, you have a better chance winning the lottery than getting into an actual T1 game, but T2 is still somewhat playable, however it's estimated that about in 1 year there will be nothing respawn can do and T2 will die just as T1. I'm already done trying to play it for reference. And alot of people think this code translates to how they made Apex Legends, which is a huge huge huge future concern for Respawn and the main reason they said ""fuck titanfall , all hands on apex legends"""
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,Yes Ver good
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,apex on crack

Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"I played this game for 577 hours by the time I write this. You don't play that much a game unless it's gold or you hate yourself a lot, but this is not League of Legends so trust me, it's a good game. And they update it constantly even though it was released more than 4 years ago, so new characters, levels, weapons and game mechanics reworks are released quite regularly, which explains why didn't I just get bored of it once I beat it."
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"Great game and very addictive, It's very challenging and fast paced also has high replayability and new things to discover so you never get bored, I highly recommend"
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"Played two hours of it so far, I enjoy it. Still learning the controls.

It's hard
Challenging
Fast paced
Easy controls
Makes you think outside the box
Jack in the box
It makes you and forces you to change your tactics and forces you to stop being retarded 
If you die you restart but things are different
Smooth like butter
Not many games have the passion and dedication put in this game
Stop whining about it being hard 

Overall I love this game"

Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"I would say something smart, but I played this game for a thousand hours and I don't exactly know why.  Reason shows it must be fun."
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"Dead Cells is pretty easy to understand and kind of hard to master, especially when you progress more and more. 
There are so many things I really love about this game: all these different enemy types, the many many many weapons and skills , the absolutely beautiful graphics, the smooth and satisfying animations and gameplay.
You can explore new things with every new run and if you're up to it you can increase the difficulty, so it's still fun, even after a long while. 
There's no right way to play this game, you can find your own and I really like that (: 
(also: buy the DLC's)"
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"This game is a bit hard at the beginning, but once you get the hang of it, it is awesome. It gets harder again when you increase the difficulty, but that makes the game challenging. It might seem a bit repetitive, but with a lot of options of weaponry, the game is playable over and over again. An extra plus point, you can quit whenever, wherever you want and resume when you want to( though i never tried quiting during a boss fight :) )."
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"In game you are no head, but you are 5head to buy this"
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"66.6 hours may not seem long to you - but it is quite a bit for me and is telling about how much I enjoyed playing this game. I would have played longer if the difficulty hadn't become too steep for me after the 3. cell - so much so that I could no longer enjoy it. But until then - it was a perfect game, demanding but fair, with almost no need for thinking so I could easily play and listen to an audio book at the same time. I was very grateful for the custom mode where I could discard all of the weapons I did not like and thus make it easier for me to use the builds I did like. 10 / 10"
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,holy fuck this game is good just play it
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,pretty fire ngl
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"I only got it because of overwhelmingly positive reviews (both on steam and outside of it). Gameplay footage seemed off to me and after playing the game, something about movement really does feel off.
With that said, I did enjoy the first try of the game."
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,lit
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"I believe that I posted a review of this game a long while back and it’s disappeared for some reason...

Anyway, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who’s keen to test their might and deep dive into the roguelike genre. My mate originally recommended this game to me and when he told me: “If you die at any point during one of the levels, you start from the beginning,” and I called him mad and wondered who on earth would play such a game. Little did I know that many months later I’d be 120+ hours deep into the game and on the fifth biome (that’s the final level of difficulty).

I grew to love Dead Cells a lot: its many challenges, parries, wide range of all sorts of weapons and abilities, replayability and the soundtrack. It’s quite hard to find a roguelike that has such enjoyable replayability value as Dead Cells and trust me, I’ve been looking around. There are only a handful of those on the market and this gem is one of those few.

The various DLCs and add-ons that found their way into the game had also been awesome.

I’m eagerly awaiting the next game that Motion Twin will make - hopefully it’s going to be another bombastic roguelike!"
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,I liked it. It was better than Cats.
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,i like dying.
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"This game is nothing short of addicting. The music is awesome, the bosses are very challenging, the variety is very extensive, considering the fact that the level design changes every time you play. All the different weapons and mutations are very interesting and creatively unique in all their own individual ways. The final boss is almost too hard - I've played this game for over 63 hours, dedicated to beating the game and I still can't beat the final boss, even after searching a how-to video on it. Guess it mostly comes down to the skills you learn and luck you find in all the random weapons you find on the way, which I think are all fair and balanced... except the throwing knife... it's kinda lame ngl... But anyway, nonetheless, it's an awesome game all around - definitely would recommend! :D"
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,buce
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"Call it a rouge-lite metroidvania if you must; but, as someone who grew up playing classic NES and SNES, I damned well know an action platformer when I see one. And Dead Cells is one of the best I've ever played. These games live and die by their controls, and DC has the best. Buttery. Precise. Forgiving. Perfect. A treat for the fingers. You will find yourself pulling off the most ridiculous stuff in the heat of the moment. The visuals are great, the enemies are a creative challenge, the music is delicious and the story is pretty much irrelevant."
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"This is the best roguelite game I've played by a fair bit. Gameplay is fast, the graphics are slick, the weapons are unique and all feel great to use, and progression is diverse enough to create variation between playthroughs while not bogging down the speed of play with long-winded explanations."
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"the game is fun and good quality rougelike 
its just so very often the design is plain stupid. 
when game which one of main features is speed and tempo, puts you spikes beneath some drop outside of your FOV it makes you mad.
when creature which shoot through walls shoot at you outside of your FOV its plain stupid design.

after 80 hours i just cant anymore 
to much stupid level designs to much rage to much bitter feeling.

never felt that with Hollow knight 
never ever felt that with Hades

i constantly leave the game in rage just because i dont feel that the F ups is my mistakes 
usually its some game design that F you scummy way and they call it ""challenge""

the FOV is poor, NO WIDESCREEN option (they said it will be cheating in a way). 
well i guess limit your fov the way you cant see the danger is the right way in their vision. 

il give you example 

in a game after you kill enemies fast enough you will get a limited but major speed buff that will replenish for each kill afterward, you will get the tempo and will fly as fast as you can.
now, as you run some times you will climb up or drop down, both ways the FOV just so limited that you will get hit hurt or killed by something something just cause you didnt saw it.
if you drop down its even more stupid, you can drop slow and get fall stun at the landing or you can hard drop with power smash at the ground.
this is when they like to put some spikes beneath. 

the intuition is lost, like sonic games when the game is all about the speed and tempo but when you got the speed the game is punish you with some unseen spikes or bullshit enemies that shoot you beyond your FOV

its not challenge its unfair 
as i said NEVER felt that with HADES never with Hollow Knight every fail felt fair and my mistake."
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,Fun and yet hard game
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"Quality platform game, generally really satisfying to complete levels.

Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"one of the best rougelikes, played both mobile and pc versions, enjoyed it alot."
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"Gameplay is smooth, gameplay loop is fun, soundtrack is great! Overall I've really enjoyed my time with the game so far."
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"Good game.
Very neat customizable difficulty.
I cheated after i beat Hand of the King for the first time though cause i'm a bloody wuss.
Maybe if you play this game for 7 hours a day for 3 weeks straight you can get past 3 cells.
Also i like the ability to turn into a grass slime
Very good game, 7/10."
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"I have never written reviews for any of my games. I have my Steam library sorted by genre and it says I own 26 Roguelike/lite games. This includes Hades, Isaac, Gungeon, etc - and I wanted to take the time to write this review to say that Dead Cells is the game I would put at the top of that list. If you have even the slightest interest in this genre of video game, it is mandatory that you play this game."
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,The best indie game made!

There are enough reviews out there that tell you that this game is a [b]very good game.[/b]

The usual points being that the game is a slow burn.
That's true because it [b]is.[/b]

But it is made to be that way so that you have time to slowly get to know the characters that are introduced to you. Slowly you begin to form your own biases and conclusions for each character as Arthur interacts with them.

You make decisions that will impact how everyone sees you and how everyone will treat you. Though I would have wanted to explore that a bit more, your decisions are gonna be influenced by the karma meter. I would have liked to be able to stay right in the middle,
like a grey moral area between good cowboy and bad cowboy but oh well.

The graphics are amazing, let's just get that out of the way. It looks great, the weather system is a little fast sometimes but not too jarring. The biomes that simulate the arid areas, the cold areas and the more temperate areas are superbly done. I especially hate the swamp lands cause it gives me that gross humid feeling and it is frankly pretty great since its able to make me feel that way.

Clothing options aplenty but with some limitations. Truly the endgame is to be able to dress up in many different outfits and be able to put on different looks whenever the mood strikes you. There's a decent amount of clothes you can layer but sometimes the physics kind of bug out. This part specifically for the online version cause the tail coats have a bug that give your character some ""extra cake"". 

There is a good selection of playable guns and I love the fact that you can customize them as well. Who wouldn't wanna ride off in the sunset with a pair of golden revolvers? Pearl handles too. [i]Fancy.[/i]

If the first few hours of the game don't hook you in, you might not enjoy the rest of the actual game. If you're struggling to make it past the first bit, I urge you to trudge along and at least give it a fair chance. It gets a lot more fun, trust me. 

Oh the free roaming is great. You can ignore the storyline completely so that you can just ride around RP-ing as a cowboy or whatever you wanna do. Standard rockstar open world but no cars, only horses.

The best part that I like about RDR2 is the hunting.
You can just chill out and instead of doing the usual thing where you shoot people,
you can just go hunting instead, stalk your prey, strike and skin 'em. Make 'em into clothes 'n stuff.

Go fishing, catch some good eats. Avoid getting bodied by a crocodile.

Just remember.

Be rootin'

and above all

Also RDO is kinda [u]meh.[/u]
So many cheaters.


RDR2 = 9/10"
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"A real living breathing world. One of if not the most immersive game worlds ever created, though it is a very slow game because its almost like being there in the old west for real. Some may like that, others may love the immersion.

It has some of the most realistic NPCs with actual AI that works, which seems rare for games of today. You can even talk to every NPC and there is a lot of interaction.

It also has, while small considering its the old west, the most immersive towns and ""cities"" (for the time period) ever created in a game. The towns are amazing, and never have I seen such amazing detail with so much interaction, realism and actual npcs that look like they belong there in towns/cities that know how to move out of your way than I have this game.

Definitely highly recommended if you are looking for a highly immersive, slow paced game, where you can actually feel like you are really living in the old west."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,My anus itches with joy
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Even though the game has been out for awhile, I held off on buying it as I was not interested at initial release.
I finally decided to take a real long look at the game, game play and reviews out there. Those pushed me over the edge and I now have RDR2 in my Library.

Let me start by saying the game still costs a premium price for as long as it has been out. That might scare some off who have tight budgets. However, for me, it is one of those games that is still worth the cost.

You are not going to finish this game quickly and feel like it cost #20.oo a day to finish a game in 3 days, something I have experienced too often.  This thing takes some time, and it is time well spent. 
The story is rich and engaging. I find the main character, Arthur Morgan, to be fascinating and entertaining as I play along. He draws you in to the game, a game rich in story.
Now the graphics, well, they are beautiful. With my RTX 3080 from Asus, I am running this game fulling Optimized through G-force Experience and still get over 100 fps at 1440p. 

Replay value on this game will be great too. I can see me playing it several times over, changing outcomes along the way by my actions just to see what happens. Now I don't feel bad about the price at all!

Looking for a game rich in story, long playing with great replay value, excellent graphics, entertaining as all get out? Here it is...................... you're welcome! :-)"
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"First i have to start by saying that this game is a masterpiece. This is the first game i have taken 100 screenshots in the first 10 hours of the game. 
Playing as Arthur was the best thing in a game because he is one of the best protagonist i have played as.
The animations and the voice actors just fit so good one with each other. This is the first game in a long time that made me do every possible mission. The side quests are so well done. Some of them change some things in the story mode.

 Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel of the first Red Dead Redemption and it's a good this cause we finally saw what happened to the gang that John was in. And now a lot of things make more sense in the first one.
Red Dead Online it's a prequel of a prequel, it's really weird. Online it's not bad, but it's hard for new players to make the gold and money. And it needs some heists/robberies but other then that it's good.

The graphics and visuals of the game are astonishing and really well made.
The gameplay it's just so good like no other game.
The soundtrack just amazing and really well fitted. A really great choice with the western like vibe of the music and game.

I fell in love with the game in the first 2 hours of it because it's just so good.
 I played like 10-12 hours per day cause it's great. No game really made me do that.  That's how much i love it. I don't regret buying this game. I bought it on sale for 40 euros. The best decision. The game is worth every penny you have. I hope they will port Red Dead Redemption to pc so i can play it or maybe a remake or remastered version of it and maybe Undead Nightmare 1&2.
So if you have the money buy the game it's worth it.
If you want to look at the screenshots that i have, some are spoilers so be carefull."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,THIS IS A GOOD LOOKING GAME
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Amazing game with stunning graphics, It's so realistic and the story is great, Online is fun to do as well, It kills time and has a lot of things to do but the only downside with online is that you come across some people who decide to hack and ruin the game by blowing you up or something, Apart from that it's awesome and I highly recommend."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,Yes! buy it!
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,long and nice story
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Thumbs up, but sucks that the game only offers perks to morally good choices. I want to be evil."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"So, RDR2 consists of two modes, Story and Online.

[b]Story[/b] - is simply incredible. Not only it features a solid and really dramatic plotline, the amount of details in this game is beyond any comparison. From your first hours in this game you will literally FEEL much love and dedication devs have put in it. Lots of stuff to do, explore and complete. It's interesting, it's enjoyable, its fun. Overall - really deep and really entertaining, very much recommending it, worth it's full price without any doubt.

[b]Online[/b] - well, now it becames problematic. It's simply too shallow comparing to singleplayer. In general your gameplay in RDO consists of two things - missions and competitive sessions like deathmatch or races. Even so caled ""roles"" are basically sets of different missions, some of them are nice and interesting, most of them are your typical fetch-kill quests. RDO also has story missions, they are kinda okay, but nothing special either. What's really bad about RDO - its people, who are playing it, since in 90% of player interactions you will be one-shot instantly from a sniper rifle long before you actually see who did this. Which in turn forces even the peaceful players to behave the same and kill first to avoid being killed. Game is full of griefers and cheaters, Rockstar doesn't give a single about them, as they never did in GTA:O. Thus the same ""pull the plug"" countermeasures which worked in GTA:O are working (and recommended) here too. It's also filled with minor, but extremely annoying bugs, the game is really unstable at times. In general - it's playable, sometimes enjoyable but lacks any memorable moments apart from really toxic ones which you won't be really happy to remember at all.

Thus, as friendly advice - don't buy standalone RDO, just buy this full version for it's Story mode in mind and you'll be good."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Good game!

I haven't played much but it's good."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"I first played this game on Xbox 4-5 months ago, and I can honestly say that this is the best game that I've ever played, and probably always will be. I never thought that I'd love a game this much, it's absolutely amazing! I'm not just talking about the story here, the graphics, the music, the details, the world itself...but man, the story ""CHEFFS KISS"". You can tell that this game was made with love, and passion, by overworked RockStar employees (no sarcasm intended). I never thought a game like this could exsist. You might think that I'm exaggerating, but damn it, I'm not! I cried for 2 hours when I finished this game (not the epilogue part, tho that made me cry too). Then I tried explaining why I cried so much to my parents, and I teared up again. I was depressed and empty for 2 fucking weeks, this game wrecked me! OK, so basically this game made soft, but damn it, it's worth it. The side characters, every litte story, every main mission, every detail, John Marston, and esspecially the one and only ARTHUR MORGAN were absolutely amazing! 
I never got attached to a character like this. He became one of my all time favorite fictional characters ever. 
I know that the price is a little bit high, but it's worth every penny of it. Definitely buy this game, and not watch story walkthroughs, cuz it's a whole other experience when you play it yourself. I can talk about this game for hours and hours, but I'm not gonna. So just buy the fricking game, and enjoy it."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,Such an amazing game. Must play if you love Single Player mode.
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,Masterpiece
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"basically yee-haw GTA V, instead of helicopters and rocket launchers you have horses and cool revolvers."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Rockstar Games is known for setting benchmarks when it comes to their open world titles. Red Dead Redemption 2 is their best work to date, without a doubt. Unquestionably beautiful, vast and detailed. It breathes life. From the tiniest toad to the scary Grizzly bear, everything feels alive and convincing. It's an environment so well crafted that it makes you wonder whether it isn't a real world within your own computer. Non-playable characters have their own lives, with a routine that they follow religiously just like we do. Some do hard work, some drink all day, some mourn their loss(es). It's hard to believe it's just a video game. I remember when Skyrim had something similar and people couldn't believe how insanely realistic it was. Imagine that, but twice as convincing. That's RDR 2 for you. They feel so alive that you feel bad for killing them with your plethora of period-accurate weaponry.
Evidently, a game is not solely made of environment and their inherent goodies. That's where the story mode comes in. And, as many of you may know by now, either from YouTube or any of the media portals you routinely visit for the daily dose of gaming news, it's a masterpiece. Storytelling is not an easy craft, but they have visibly dominated it after decades and decades of duly delivered benchmarks of how an open world game should be. They make it seem easy, almost as if anyone could do it. Memorable characters, insane character development just like we like it and then fantastic endings based on your own decisions. As linear as it may be, forcing you to do things their way rather than setting your imagination free and letting you decide how to approach a mission, it still allows you to take certain decisions that will shape the moral values of your character, therefore leading it to a specific outcome. Games don't often get the whole moral debate right, understandably so, because they are empty characters with a pre-recorded set of phrases and reactions that can't resonate with you. But Arthur Morgan is different. It's a rather captivating individual, that feels real. Real enough that you will often find yourself questioning whether to kill or spare someone, or if you should or not help that person in need. And inevitably feel the pain of uncertainty of the future - or the lack thereof - that lies ahead.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a western beyond all westerns. An adventure you can dive in yourself, and watch your character grow through all the hardships of the outlaw life. A novel-like main character that is a criminal, killer, cruel and savage but also a human being like all of us. And humanity wins, in the end. Arthur learns what it is to be human, and there is no better teacher than life itself.
Would I recommend Red Dead Redemption 2? It would be a crime not to. As flawed as it may be in certain aspects like the slightly truncated gameplay, the typical Rockstar linearity and the underwhelming online mode, the story is something out of this world. It truly outstands. Goes above and beyond the average video game storytelling. It's something you've got to experience to understand. A must-play for every gamer out there."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,Arthur Morgan is such a chad you almost forget he isnt a reel human bean
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,yee haw y'all
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"mainly played on the playstation.
honestly one of the best stories ive seen in a game, an amazing experience.

red dead online, however, is more or less a grindy cash grab."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"This is the perfect story game.

I regret rushing through it like i did, completing the main story in 39 hours. There is so much to explore and do which could lead to 100+ hours of gameplay. Even so, the 39 hours that I did get through felt magical. This game is a living and breathing environment. Nothing felt cookie-cutter about the world. Everywhere I went felt new and fresh to the place I went last. 

The Van Der Linde gang members feel all unique, with all different personalities. I formed intricate attachments to each of them, which makes their fate feel all the more special, or tragic. Every cool thing they did felt great, and every sad moment felt heartbreaking. The Villains as well were perfectly made too. Every character you were meant to like, i liked, and every character you were meant to hate, i hated. That is perfect character development.

The soundtrack for this game is unreal also, really immersed me into the game. Normally in games i turn off the music, but i kept the RDR2 soundtrack on. Don't regret it one bit.

Even though I'm finished with the main story, and soon the Epilogue, this will no doubt not be the only time i play through the story. Some changes I'll make is that I'll explore more, its easy to get wrapped up in the story and I missed out on so many cool things to do. 

Rockstar outdid themselves with this game. Luckily I bought this on sale, but I would pay the £55 HAPPILY. After 2 years, the pricetag may be off-putting to some people, but they will not regret it. If Rockstar ever do a RDR3, they should double down on the prequel stuff, and go right back to 1865 where the Wild West is dawning and rampant characters are fighting for supremacy, would make for an awesome prequel to the prequel.

I cannot fault this game, aside from the Rockstar Launcher being trash, 10/10

Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,cowboy
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Almost 10 years on Steam and there are plenty of games that really made me WOW but RDR2 is seriously on a different level. I barely wrote any review on Steam, this might be one of my first one, but I feel the need to do it, especially after over 100 hours spent playing this masterpiece.
Well, the first thing about this game that really made my jaw dropped is its OPEN WORLD. Hands down this game has the best open world graphic ever. Weather effects are on point, wild animals reaction is above and beyond also. I once left my game idle for few minutes and even saw a black bear trying to catch fishes near the river. Birds got scared and flew away when you're passing by on your horse.....everything is so real in this game. And not just the graphic and its open world, the story is awesome, it feels like you're watching a movie. Game soundtracks are TOP NOTCH.
But that's pretty much all the positive reviews of this game is about. I'm not saying the gameplay is bad, but for me, it aint great either. The gun fight is not intense or challenging at all. the character control, house control is just.......meh. I couldn't keep track of how many times I got myself stuck in places that Arthur or his horse couldnt even move or perform any action. Horse control is straight up horrible also, riding it in Saint Dennis is a nightmare cuz bumping into one person can lead to whole lot of troubles. To sum it up, the control in this game doesn't match its beauty.
In conclusion, this game is still a true masterpiece if you don't seek any extreme gaming experience and just wanna lay back on your couch and enjoy the story line with easy, relaxing gameplay. 

P/s; I hope this helps. And sorry my English is horrible."

Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"I could write a full paper on this game, I'll try to be succinct.
While with most games, even great ones, there are several things in which to find flaws, I don't think it's too difficult to argue that RDR2 is the pinnacle of it's genre. I don't even like western themed games or movies, to the contrary, I tend to dislike them by default, but this game easily took a top spot in my all time video game favorites, and I've been playing video games since Colecovision.
The only real issue is the controls could use some remapping, as they occasionally feel a bit ... ""out of sorts."""
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,loved it wish rdr1 was ported to steam also i play it on ps4
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Here's the deal.  I'm not really into ""the wild west.""  But this game is just beautiful.  I'm finding myself doing all of the side quests, not just for completion's sake or to experience more...but I don't want the game to end.  The story has been more intricate than a lot of games, the scenery is fun and varied and the characters feel natural.  And the horse riding...It's so much better than other games with the mechanic.  Over a 100 hours in and hoping for at least another 100."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,dis shit bussin
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,One of the best games I have ever played and will probably ever play. There is simply nothing like it.
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"This game is amazing and I am in love with it. It's a very polished game with an engaging story, interesting characters, memorable moments, and an amazing soundtrack. Arthur Morgan for me definitely became one of the best protagonists of all time. A well-written character with a tragic story who becomes more than just an outlaw.

But the game also has some problems... 
The wanted system is hit or miss, broken economy but for me biggest disappointing thing was the game design. Rockstar created this huge open-world game with a ton of things to do like hunting, fishing, exploring, robbing, and killing, but when it comes to story missions it's super linear aka follow the yellow line. You can't approach a mission differently, you always need to do what the game says you to do and if you do anything other than what the mission said you to do, the mission failed. Approach the enemy from another angle? Mission failed. Take a different route? Mission failed. Mount your horse, go there, kill everybody and repeat over and over. I loved the story in this game, but some exciting story missions for me were outweighed by this repetitiveness and lack of freedom.

It's definitely worth its price and I highly recommend this game for everyone who loves exploring and slow-paced games."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,I Guess I… I’m Afraid.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"I'am going through my third play through of this game and i love it so much. It is a great mix of action, adventure and has a very moving story. You learn to grow attached to the characters in the game whilst simultaneously feeling like a bad ass. It is a little slow in the movement, but you can get used to that really quickly. I give this game a big thumbs up and multiple buckets of chicken wings. It truly is a game worth playing"

Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"there is obviously a reason why i have only been playing this for a while but i can say that it is really an amazing game. rockstar's best work so far after GTA, i spent hours playing it on PS4, the character of arthur morgan is very attached, carried away by an epic storyline, an adventure and a betrayal. boredom in this game is only at the beginning of the game where we are riding to a place and have to stay focused and in the future it will be helped by travel that can be upgraded in our camp. There's not much I have no doubt this is truly a masterpiece. BUT, please rockstar fix your server, and speed up loading in your launcher"

I just grinded out this game for a whole week straight and finished the story and this has got to be one of the best games I have ever played, Not to mention, this is also the first game to make me tear up, out of all the games I've ever played. This past week, I grew strongly to love the characters in this game and the story overall. I didn't get bored or felt I was burnt out throughout the entire time I was playing this game. I just wanted to know more about the story and was super eager to see what was next. This game is almost like an interactive movie that is around 80hrs long. The story, graphics, characters, everything was a 10/10. This game is def in my top 5 games of all time maybe even top 3. I've never been so invested in a games story as much as this one. I loved it. I haven't gotten 100% completion yet but I'm probably gonna go for that as well. To anyone who has not bought this game yet, please give it a try. I've been doubting this game for so long and I regret it. This was truly a masterpiece."

Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"A perfect game to escape reality for the next couple of hundreds hours. Especially if you play on PC in 4K. Absolutely outstanding graphics experience comparing to PS4 version. But all the existing bugs from console version are still here. Like your horse will just disappear 2-3 times during the story mode. Plus after 5 hours the game will start to crash (same thing in GTA V - same engine, same bugs). And of course animal hunting is a huge pain in the ass since some animals such as cougar won't spawn at the designated locations, so you have to visit the same list of locations so the script would work and you'll finally skin your big cat. Nevertheless, the game is worth buying. It's the last of its kind game because NOW all the market can offer you is The Last of Untolerated to Ugly Girls 2."

Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"[i] Don't mind the hours, I have finished the game on another platform and liked it so much that decided to buy it on steam too. [/i]

As much as I love Rockstar, during all the years that I have been familiar with them, I have never got to playing RDR1. I don't know why, it just never happened. One day when I had nothing to play, I decided to try RDR2, I watched some reviews, many of which were saying that the game is very boring and slow and many people don't even finish the game or it takes them several months to finish etc. I became worried that the same might happen to me but still I started playing. The game started interesting me immediately. 

Long story short, I binged the game in a week.

It's a fantastic game, if you consider yourself someone who loves games, this is a game worth trying at least once."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,Probably the best game ever made. The level of detail in the world is incredible. The story telling. The voice acting. The gameplay itself. Everything is 10/10. What a masterpiece.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,Great Game
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"First play through was on xbox, now I'm doing 2nd on PC. This game is so unbelievable. If you love immersing yourself in a world and characters this game is for you. All-time favorite."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"An in-depth story with well crafted characters who are frustratingly human, smooth gunplay and enemies that can surprise you even when you do cowboy bullet time.

You can sink hundreds of hours in the game but I cannot fully suggest the online mode, as for every helpful or nice player, I found 20 angry teenagers who think randomly attacking people is the peak of fun. Of course if you throw dynamite or shoot them in the head with the starter revolver, it can be an odd kind of satisfying.

Back to the SP though: It's fun! You can customise your character more than CJ from GTA:SA, you can choose if you're the type of player who murders random people, insults them, mugs and threatens people or you can choose to be a robber with a heart of gold, helping random people, doing your best where you can, only taking from those who mug and murder other people or indeed you can tow some kind of balance between the two.

I will say two things for new players though: This game has a lot of hidden details in characters facial expressions and small tics they have in cutscenes and player interaction and you can ignore the honour system mostly but it will impact the ending of the game and how people in the game assume your character is going to act.

I do however suggest getting it on sale, not because it's bad but because it's freakin' expensive."

Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Let's be honest. If you're reading this, you already know you want to buy this masterpiece of visual interactive art. You're just looking at the review section to see if you can A. Convince yourself to pay full price for a game that's been out on PC for a year and a half, and 2 and a half years in general, but also B.

Well here's the thing: You're gonna spend that money. You're gonna spend it, because you know by now that the story is fantastic. You know that the art is breathtaking.

You're gonna spend that money, because you've already seen all your friends do it, and your streamers, and your onlyfans creator, and your dad, and your grandma, and now you want to do it too.

You want to spend that muneh. It's a good game, and it's worth every dime. So here's your invitation: Go ahead.

You'll be alright, boah"

Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,THERE WAS A FROG
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"Both Ori games are the best plattformer games i have ever played.

Amazing Art/Design, best visuals i have ever seen in a video game.
Amazing Sound/Music.

I liked the Story very much, it was very emotional. (for me)

Game Difficulity was punishable but not on a impossible/troll level. (i only played on Hard)

I would recommend it to every single person.
Also i would strongly recommend to play the first one first. (for the story)"
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,Cry. Rage. Cry. Rage. Cry. Rage. Cry. Rage. I think they may have copied the gameplay loop of a LASA student.
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"After Ori the Blind Forest, I think this is the best sequel that could happen. This is a must for all. The Ori series is absolutely a masterpiece. For everything Moon Studios and Microsoft did <3 <3. Maybe this 2D based game with exceptional story is what people want rather than having RTX and shit. 100% exploration has its benefits with even better environments and characters! The Story of Ori may or maynot end here."
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"The most beautiful, dark, heart wrenching Ori game i have ever played.
Amazing story that pulled at so many emotions.
Gorgeous design from the different areas.
Side Questing and collecting resources encouraged me to explore a lot.
Combat and Platforming was smooth.

If you liked Ori and The Blind Forest, then i highly suggest playing this one! Will Of The Wisps really improves from the first game <3 10/10 
"
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,its a really good game the art is stunning and if you think the games is trash go jump back into your mum
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"I like to finish a game before doing a review. Even more for games like Ori.
I was completely in love with the first game. And I am as much in love with the second one. The graphics, the gameplay, the music (THE MUSIC) and the story. This game is as beautiful (maybe even more so) than the first one. The details put in the background, the characters and everything else is so good.
The music just brings so much to the game and to the story. I have tears in my eyes just thinking about it and just hearing the soundtrack.
Ori will forever be one of my favourite game (and favourite soundtrack)."
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,Very beautiful and feels good to play all the way through. The combat is significantly improved compared to the first game and the platforming got more challenging as new interesting mechanics are introduced.
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,10/10 Would get confused on where to go again.
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"An upgrade to ori and the blind forest in any possible way, the save system of the first ori was horrible so im glad they changed it to a more traditional autosave. the movement is crisp, fluid and precise by far one of the best character movement in 2d sidescroller ever and the animation and music are fantastic. My only complaint is that the map could use some extra side content and the story didnt hit as hard as the first one but those are 
 tiny nitpicks. AMAZING GAME 9/10"
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"asdfghjk,"
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"Good story line!
Good music!
Amazing gameplay!!"
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"This game has a beautiful story. The game itself is demanding in terms of requirements but if they are met one gets excellent quality of lovely textures and game play. The skill set is significantly broadened when compared to the first Ori game. It has a variety of ranged and melee skills. It also has mini racing games that could be played in multiplayer online.
I would recommend to play through the 1st and the 2nd games so that you can experience the full story and see the entire plot unfold in the end of the second game. It's a truly beautiful story and it's worth it! :)"
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"I've played Ori and the Blind Forest, so I expected something great from this one.

What else can I say? The game devs never fail to impress me as always. Absolutely gorgeous."
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,Blind Forest ama çok daha iyisi
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,The best sequel Blind Forest could ask for. Improvements in every aspect of the game from the first one. Moon Studios created an absolute gem. Fantastic stuff.
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"Beautiful and fun game. Definitely a must. Also tears wont stop falling, damn!"
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,An emotional rollercoaster with a superb visual style and an amazing soundtrack. Also includes a great game for free.
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"This game takes everything from the first one and makes it that much better. Now I know what you must be thinking, ""But zzFuzzy, I read your Ori and the Blind Forest review which you gave a perfect ten out of ten. How can it get better?""
I am here to say trust me, it does. And it isn't worth spoiling a lick of. Buy this game and play it, you'll have no regrets. It is outlandishly entertaining."
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,don' like platformer type of game. But this one game is an exception for me.
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"Just when I though Ori and the Blind Forest couldn't get any better, Ori and the Will of the Wisps has exceeded my expectations again! Excellent improvement to the gameplay and combat mechanics. As always, the game's design and art are a feast for the eyes! As for the difficulty, the sequel is much more forgiving this time; found myself dying less than the previous title. Action sequences are still challenging and riveting! In Ori and the Will of the Wisps, the story comes full circle and Ori's tale is brought to an end, or at least that's what I think! Bittersweet ending. I love how the developers were able to come up with a villain that elicits both hate and pity from the player. Really hoping for a sequel though! Kudos to Moon Studios for an amazing sequel!"
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"Honestly, this is just such a beautiful game, with so much to offer. 
Fantastic music, story development and characters that will most certainly captivate you.
I do like how the fighting mechanics developed from the first game, it makes it much more enjoyable and challenging, where you should remember and take into account different weapons to fight different enemies.

I also like that bosses were introduced, quite a big change from the first game. 
An extraordinary experience everyone should have."
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,goated games
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"The game is awesome, very cute musics, graphics and awesome puzzles along the story, average boss fights also makes game amazing in every way for me. Only thing i didn't like so much the skill tree, its so much hollow knight."
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,First metroidvaia and I love it. This is what made me explore games that are not AAA titles and I find some of my favorite games because of that. And the soundtrack is beautiful.
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"Art and Environment 9.8/10 
Mechanics 9.9/10
Story 7.1/10
Overall Experience 9.5/10

[NO SPOILERS]
I personally prefer the mechanics in this game, rather than the first one. You're able to move a lot better, full of possibilities early on in this second game. There's a good balance of exploring, escaping, fighting etc., it has been pleasant to me. On the other hand, I didnt buy this story. It was too cheesy, way below the first game for me. 

Overall, this is certainly a game I would recommend buying. A masterpiece. Its price is a bit high, so you could wait for the next sale season. But I would buy it even without the discounts. I certainly had a lot of fun and, as I did for the first one, I will be playing this again any time soon."
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"Amazing game that lives up to the reputation of the first, but adding many new and fresh mechanics and questing options. 9.5/10"
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,This and Ori and the blind forest are the most beautiful games i have ever played and the story is just as beautiful
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"I liked it for mostly the same reasons as the previous game, except that this time I actually used other abilities than the main one every once in a while"
Ori and the Will of the Wisps,Adventure,1057090,"This game missed the mark in the same way Doom Eternal did for me. A extremely promising sequel that took significant ludic influence from outside itself, and in the process comprimised the entire gameplay identity of the franchise.

The game itself... is fun enough, but it's not a good sequel to Blind Forest. It doesn't improve on the first game, rather it wipes away most of the unique takes and pastes Hollow Knight on top.

Blind Forest was not heavily focused on combat, by design. It irritates me that Moon Studios removed the unique low-combat-focus in favor of a by-the-books metroidvania (read: Hollow Knight) combat system, and sacrificing many opportunities for the chase sequences that made the first game truly unique.

I understand that having animals inhabit the environment and interact with Ori makes sense, but holy lord jesus it's just Hollow Knight again. Map dude, merchants, quests... Just go away.

Ori is not Hollow Knight. I don't care how good Hollow Knight was, it spoiled any chance Blind Forest had of getting a true sequel.

Art is great. Soundtrack is great. Chase sequences, where they still exist, are still phenomenal. The powers, new and returning (Bash, Dig, etc.) , are all interesting. But it pisses me off that they were so willing to copycat another franchise."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,Rock and stone
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"An absolute masterclass of co-op game design. Every class feels distinct and purposeful to the point where having a full composition is nigh essential to having the complete DRG experience. Every gadget you have will benefit the whole team in one way or another. Every weapon is impactful and fills a specific niche on top of being customizable to fit any gamestyle you'd hope to accomplish. Nothing feels weak and your performance will not depend on which weapons you will carry, but how you'll use them. Enemies are recognizable even from afar and have clear weakpoints and resistances. Dwarves are very much talkative and will comment on their situations, as well as throw banter around. Every biome is different from one another and, along with the random cave generation, will help make every run feel unique in its own way. Gamemodes are varied and fun and will supply you with countless hours of mining bliss. Cosmetics, pickaxe parts, weapons and modifications are all unlockable. Nothing is locked behind a paywall, except for some cosmetic packs that only serve to support the devs who, frankly, deserve every penny coming to them. The replay value is off the charts and you'll always find something new to do. Get 3 friends and play the game and you'll have a blast! And even if you don't have anyone to play with, the community is second to none and you'll eventually make friends just playing online. If you're looking to go solo, the game offers a bot called ""Bosco"" that can accompany you on your endeavours. Bosco can mine, shine his light, dig tunnels, carry minerals and even terminate bugs *with extreme prejudice*!

You're gravely missing out if you don't buy Deep Rock Galactic NOW! Join the union and you'll be downing beers with your fellow dwarves in no time. And remember, if you don't Rock and Stone, you ain't coming home!"
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"Just buy it, don't even think twice about it."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,Rock and Stone or you ain't coming home!
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"Dwarfs? Big insect swarms? Endless booze? Sign me up! Good game single player, but this game definitely shines in random pubs or with a group of friends fighting the endless swarms of bugs that want to eat your face. Great replayability, randomly procedural generation on every mission, no cave system is the same. Game is actually difficult at the higher levels. Plenty of unlocks for each character, weapons, cosmetics and mods."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"This is the best co-op shooter out there and it only gets better and better with consistent updates from the devs. Great to play solo but even better with friends. I would recommend playing at Hazard 3 and above only as 1 and 2 don't really show the game off much in terms of swarms and such. There's just so much to like here. Rock and stone, brothers."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,Karl would be proud. ROCK AND STONE!
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"Deep Rock Galactic has everything a co-op shooter should offer. The combat is thrilling, the exploration is deep, and the game itself is infinite. Pure fun and joy. You can't go wrong with this one. Cheers dwarfs 🍺"
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"New players beware. Servers filled with high level players that will boot you every game. Finished the tutorial only to never set foot into a game over 5 mins without being kicked. 

Either find a team that youll be able to grind your levels up high enough to solo or forget it. RIP having no friends."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,ROCK AND STONE
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"I'm not seeing the joy that others are.  So far, its just kinda... boring."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"Somehow lost hundreds of hours to this game, unlimited replayability, great to play with friends, easy to use matchmaking and the friendliest community"
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"It is pretty great. Defenitely one of the best contestants for CooP focussed gameplay, but also very good alone. Bosco, your drone companion in solo gameplay, is effective, simple, and gives another layer of deptht to the gameplay, while playing as a group is just fun. I have only played with friends so far though, but I can only recomment to learn together.
The game is well paced, I am 150 hours in now and have accomplished alot, but still got things to uncover and build up. It's a blast, for both casual fun and stressfull, yet rewarding, high difficulty gameplay. Noone forces you to go into higher threat levels, but you get your rewards faster if you do. Rewards you choose yourself. 

A word to the studio:
I am amazed by the detail and love you put into your game. Little things most players will probably gloss over, like hidden voicelines and sparking cables in the Rig... stuff like that makes the game feel alive, without adding any convoluted story or complexity. Thank you. Thank you for your subtlety."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"One of the best co-op games ever! DRG has a nice community of players. It's super rare to run into someone who is actually toxic. Everyone tends to work together really well and playing with randoms is no problem! The gameplay loop is simple but super satisfying. The procedural generation for caves is some of the best I've seen as far as procedural generation goes. The layouts always feel fresh to me and I still get amazed by some of the rooms (and the sheer size of some of them). Deep Rock Galactic is one of my favorite games and is absolutely worth the $30 price tag. Don't worry about whether you have friends to play with already or not, because you'll make plenty of new ones in DRG. Rock and Stone!"
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"There is nothing negative to say about this game. It's fun, creative, and well polished. ROCK AND STONE TO THE BONEEEEE"
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"This game is great. It's a great co - op experience and it's even fun solo. The developers really do care for the game and update it constantly (thank you very much), and even right now there are lots of collectables to work for. The gameplay loop is extremely fun and engaging. Add to that the 4 different classes with a wide array of weapons, upgrades and support tools and you got yourself some variety. Shooting bugs and mining morkite in about 10 different ways never gets old. Overall, the game is one of the best ones i've played, and coming back to it from the beta I can see the love and effort from caring devs oozing out from every corner."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"I think this is one of the best games I've gotten into in a good while, its design nails a lot of things incredibly well into place. Enemy design and variety coupled with the procedurally generated caves, affected by the selected mission type, compliment each other well in creating new situations to endure through every dive. The classes and perk system compliment each other making every class well capable in any role from DPS to support, none of the classes really feel necessary in an usual sense. 

On topic of perks the game's progression system is quite engaging with multiple separate mechanics tied to different means of upgrading your dwarves. The standard weapon upgrades seem to mostly fall somewhere on a line between DPS and survivability, both being valid choices. The dripfeed of content via additional overclocks for your weapons makes it worth to wait for each cycle of weeklies and deep dives. Everyone is on equal footing on the RNG of this side, it's completely free from lootboxes or mictrotransactions. Every core you get is guaranteed to be a new unique find.

Cosmetics are an important part of Deep Rock, more than in any other video game as they are all tied into continuing to play, barring a few little cosmetic DLC. The great majority of items are still part of the base game. It makes it surprisingly satisfying to come up with a flashy new getup for your miner or when you salute with whatever almost ceremonial pickaxe design. Stone and rock."

It's not really the kind of game you play for hours on end, but it's the perfect kind of game when you have an hour or two to kill."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"Very nice structured game, one of the best for playing co-op and very good to play with randoms too. Stylized graphics pretty cool. Upgrades are pretty interesting (Opportunities for builds included)
It's also very easy to come back to after a long period of time not playing, which is great too.

You will be supplied with company issue tools and weapons of your choosing for your class which will aid you and your team to mow through the enemy swarms and survive the hostile environment. Once your task is complete we will extract you back to the safety of the space rig, where you can drink a well earned pint of company issue beer at the Abyss Bar before your next mission.

Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"Super fun game with some of the best customization I have seen in a game ever. The spacestation you spawn in after completing the tutorial gives me vibes of a Destiny 1 tower. It is a social hub where you can customize weapons, characters, and even chill out at. The mines change constantly for anywhere you choose to go so you truly never know what you are getting yourself into. With plenty of enemy types and variants, minerals types, and places to go, this game will always keep you glued to the screen. Finally, the community and dev team are some of the most friendly people you could ever meet. The devs of this game are what every dev team should strive to be more like. With all this in mind, whether you pay the $30 or buy it on sale, get ready to sit back, relax, and mine!

Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"This game is a love baby between Left 4 Dead 2 and Minecraft. It combines the shooting and teamwork of L4D2 (done right) and Minecraft's terrain altercation and mining to bring you a pretty unique game. To mining crystals, to fighting aliens with pretty powerful weapons, this game blends these two ideas pretty well. But the multiplayer is where it shines, as the multi-class system shows the strengths and weakness of each class, and if you can manage to have a team of four different classes, your team can do pretty much everything. 

I played this game earlier this year on the Microsoft Store before it was on Steam, and it has changed a lot since then. From the looks of it, the developers are taking a massive step in the right direction. I just wish they had an option to sync your progress from one platform (Microsoft to Steam) to another platform. Hours of progress gone, but I'm excited to do it again!

Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"Incredibly fun and addicting space dwarf action. Props to the devs not only for making such a great game, but also for keeping the paid content to a minimum with only the cosmetic bundles on the Steam store page. Aside from those, all other cosmetic items and upgrades must be earned in-game, which is a huge breath of fresh air in today's landscape.

Not too sure what my rating would be, so I guess I'll settle on an 8/10 for now. 73 hours in and still having a great time means I pretty much can't go lower than that."

Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"A very good co-op shooter about dwarves digging in caves. The game is addictive, but while playing with a friend, we noticed one problem. The game has a division into difficulty levels from the first to the fifth, but they are poorly balanced among themselves, since the third level of difficulty is very easy, almost like the second, and the fourth is several times more difficult than the third. It would be nice to have a thorough adjustment of the game's difficulty, or an intermediate one, like three and a half, or the ability to create a custom difficulty with the same reward as the original difficulty (I mean a thorough adjustment of the same difficulty levels that are already in the game, with the ability to only complicate.) I hope that you will read this review and learn something useful from it. Sincerely, a player in your game."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"I've never written a review before and I'm kind of drunk (rock and stone) but i absolutely love this game.
I can't think of another game besides Mass Effect that made me face such terrifying moral quandaries as whether or not to kill a lootbug or Huuli Hoarder.

The dwarf in me wants to kill them for the loot but the humanity in me hates it. 

I can't think of a better endorsement for this game."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"Deep Rock Galactic is one of the best ""indie games"" I've ever seen. It's best with friends, meaning the solo gameplay can feel pretty lonely as there is nothing else to really interact with, but you can play with randoms as well and the community is pretty good. The premise is ""You're a dwarf paid to extract valuable minerals and kill bugs while deep underground on a foreign planet"" and the gameplay balance is a bit like Payday2 meets Minecraft. It's a very solid co-op shooter in a randomly-generated environment with sandbox destruction and mild platforming. Break walls, take gems, shoot bugs, and escape. Some missions are more complex than others, but that's the core idea. There are 4 classes to play as that excel in their own fields but suffer in others, hence the call to play with friends so they can pick up the slack in areas you're not good at. Gunner is good for damage and protection, Driller is good for crowd control and manipulating the environment, Engineer is good for defense and support, and Scout is good for exploration and traversal. You get plenty of weapon upgrades and perks to help out, and every gameplay style and mission type is included in the core game. All DLC and paid content is purely cosmetic. There are a lot of AAA game companies that can't say that about themselves (Rockstar, Ubisoft, Bethesda, etc). Plus, the full game is extremely well-optimized, taking just over 2GB on your hard-drive and delivering moody ambiance despite having pretty simple graphics. Deep Rock Galactic stands as a wonderful indie game that outperforms several current titles from major studios. Take thirty dollars from the money you were going to spend on the next Ubisoft game and buy this instead, you won't regret it."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,oui
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"It's extremely fun as it is, but the developers are still constantly growing the game. 

The community is one of the best ever. Once, I had to leave a mission right at the start while it was loading. I messaged the host on steam to tell him to kick me because I had an emergency and had to go (I had added him as a friend after meeting in the game just a few days before, so this is not a ""Real life"" friend). 

Instead of kicking me, the other 3 carried me through the entire Hazard 5 mission.

I take the helm and keep us on course, he works the cannons and is an excellent shot.

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"You wake in a tavern, replenish your ship's supplies (food, wood, cannon balls) and customize it's cosmetics.
You talk with an NPC who gives you a quest. You receive a map of an island with red crosses on it.
You go to your ship and search for that island on the world map. You find it, and figure out which way to sail.
You unfurl your sails and turn the helm towards the destination.

A few minutes pass. While you're in the middle of the ocean, trying to navigate around a storm, the water suddenly turns black. Combat music kicks in, as a pair of tentacles emerge from the depths.
A wild Kraken appears, and it thinks that your ship is tasty.
You grab a handful of cannonballs from storage and man the cannons.
With a few well placed shots and a couple shredded tentacles, the Kraken leaves you alone.
You repair the damage to your ship, and jump in the water to pick up the Kraken's meat.
Looking at the map, a short detour towards a trading post is possible.
You place the meat on a skillet to cook, while you turn your ship towards the merchants.
After selling the Kraken meat, you set sail towards your quest.
The rest of the voyage is uneventful, and you reach the island and drop the anchor.
With map in one hand and a shovel in another, you set foot on the tropical island before you.
With no minimap, you need to read the map and orient yourself based on landmarks you see.
Eventually you find one of the places where the treasure should be.
Enthusiastically, you swing your shovel in to the sand and hit wood!

You've found a wooden chest, that is one of the treasures on the island.
However, you also found a pack of animated skeletons who would rather you not take the treasure.
You draw your sword and fight the bones.
You notice a lone skeleton carry a big red barrel of gunpowder toward you. Without skipping a beat, you run a few paces away and draw your pistol.
With a single shot, you hit the barrel which promptly explodes, obliterating the nearby skeletons.
One of which drops a piece of parchment.
On the parchment there is a quest...

Sea of Thieves is a well polished multiplayer-only title about adventure. There's plenty of stuff to do, and the game always finds more activities to offer you.
The only downside is that it requires a crew to be viable in PVP (which can't be turned off), and to be effective the crew needs to communicate well. It can be hard to find such crew, so it's best played with friends you know in advance."

P.S: Thanks Rare, honestly you guys are one of the most amazing game developers ever.
Turned this game from something little (2018) to what I can call one of the best experiences I had with a game right now and hopefully more soon.

Double P.S: Can we have ice zones now hmmm?"

Then after a lengthy battle of wit you find yourself on a island where you can sell all your precious loot! Then, do it all again with new random encounters.

Sea of thieves is a first=person pirate adventure game where you can do whatever you like. The game looks goofy but the water looks amazing. The gameplay is very varied and it is lots of fun with other people to play. I definitiely reccommend this game."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"I am really unsure whether I should recommend this game or not. 

Pro:
-Awesome piratey atmosphere
-Sailing is a lot of fun, especially with friends, but also single
-Cool stories and exploration is fun

Con:
-Toxic Community
-You're killed on sight, no matter if you have loot, are friendly or mind your own business, then made fun of
-There are no PVE servers, not even safezones
-No Roleplay except with your friends

Me and my friends lost interest in this game fairly quickly. We wanted to enjoy the game, not constantly participate in some waterbased pvp-arena, in which one is forced to compete because of nonexisting pve-guidelines, therefore the perfect hunting grounds for toxic-pvp players. While merely learning the basics, we have been killed countless times and had to learn many things from youtube, because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to play the game at all. 

@developers: I understand, that it's an important aspect in a pirate game to be able to freely murder and pillage, but why are there no safezones, at least where the traders are (almost every multiplayerbased game with pvp-elements has those or npc-guarded zones)? Please reconsider including more pve-friendly mechanics, maybe a pirates codex with rules, which are not optional to a certain degree or maybe an npc-based menace like the royal navy, where playergroups can join in a pirate alliance to take on npc-vessels. The game has a lot of potencial, sadly not so much for atmosphere-loving pve players. For now I therefore give this game no recommendation, because in the current state im not motivated to play it any further."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"A lot of fun to play with friends; the exploration, grinding, and tall tales are all fun, but one thing to note is the players are often unforgiving and will gladly sink your ship even if you don't bring anything with it"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Patch removed the only way for me to play this game without getting motion sick. Great accessibility improvements, thanks Rare. Couldn't play longer than 10 minutes after the patch before getting sick enough to wanting to puke. 90 horizontal FOV is not playable for people who are sensitive to conflict of visual and vestibular systems.
They had to do that right when I started to appreciate the game enough to start recommending it to others. Guess I'm not doing that now. Not when Rare explicitly shuns a sizable chunks of players while pretending to be accessible."

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"After they broke the FOV for PC I cant play this game anymore due to motion sickness, after spending lots of real money on their emporium too, so disappointed...

This sums it up pretty well:

Let's be real for a second. Why do people use high FOV? Because low FOV makes them motion sick. That is a fact, and even with FOV cranked up all the way to the maximum with a config edit I do get motion sick during storms due to excessive ship shaking. And lower FOVs only worsen the situation. High FOV is a legitimate accessibility feature they just removed. This alone renders the game nigh-unplayable for me and many other players. Because we literally cannot play it due to us getting motion sick in a matter minutes/hours (all depends on a person). For boasting high amount of accessibility features (some of which are legitimately great) - developers forgot about a fairly common and long-known issue among players. Some of them get motion sick, and cannot play at low FOVs due to that.

Now let's talk about ""unfair advantage"". To which I want to say - what advantage exactly? High FOV is advantageous for peripheral vision, but it drastically reduces your ability to see in the distance, as all objects get way smaller. But SOT gameplay is primarily based on distance. Who spots the ship in the horizon first? Person to whom said ship is visibly larger or one who can see a bit more to the sides but everything in the distance is smaller? Obviously the first one, and on practice I've experienced it numerous times as I struggle to find that tiny sail in the distance. God help me to figure out if they have an emissary on top of that. Not to mention that I have harder time reading tall tales as they are almost 2x smaller and not being able to use some tricks like looking down to the map from upper floor trough the openings - it's too small. But sure, I can see to the sides a bit more. How did that help me in gameplay? Not a lot, because melee fights are not that prevalent, and skeletons don't pose much of a threat regardless of FOV.
In conclusion - FOV does not provide players unfair advantage. If anything, it have a slew of disadvantages specific to SOT. FOV is not just ""see more on the sides"", it's a trade-off between being able to see in a more wide angle at exchange of being able to see in a distance.

Now to TOS. If you look at where the configuration files are stored - they are located in the userspace, not in the game folder, meaning that editing those are within the user discretion and is not editing static game files. It's not the same as patching game archives to change textures and such. Developers still can claim it's part of ""game files"", but those same files are created by the game on first startup as well as edited by it when user configured the game. While config did exploit a configuration section that was not exposed in the UI - it is still just a configuration of the game, not a hack or a cheat (which are bannable).

People are pissed about this ""fix"" not because it gives advantage. They are pissed because it made the game a lot worse for them as they are no longer can play it comfortably without getting motion sick."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"New free content every season is neat.

What's not neat is seeing that your players have an issue with the default maximum FoV setting (90° horizontal), seeing that they've found a way to get around that and make the game actually playable, and then patching it out.

You're literally preventing people who get motion sickness at a lower FoV from enjoying your game. Why are you doing this?"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,removed 120FOV xbox players crying even tho it gave 0 advantage. the devs dont care about PVP
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Very good game, but the community really sucks ass. We ran into another player called RealCoolGuy123 and he just spawn camped our ship and killed everyone on the server and teleported around while hacking. What a shame the report system doesn't actually work. Very disappointing."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"This is a game I play with friends when they want to play it themselves, but I'd never EVER set foot in it of my own volition. In its current state, it's a game that lives and breathes toxicity while also looking visually pretty and having an interesting gameplay loop.

There is basically zero depth in the progression system because all you have to use as a pirate is the small set of weapons you are given, and as you play more you receive nothing new except for cosmetics and titles. As it is a live service game, the nice cosmetics are all locked in the microtransaction store, but whatever. That's nowhere near the biggest problem with this game.

PVE is a slog, since you're spending literal hours sailing to faraway locations for fetch quests, and bosses in high-tier activities take way too long to kill. It also doesn't help pacing when you see that some bosses (if not all; I haven't encountered every single one), if not kept constantly under attack, will heal themselves at any chance they get. It's incredibly annoying. Nothing has a health bar.

To add insult to injury, PVP is a hugely toxic mess that plagues this game like a nasty group of piranhas. Nobody puts any thought into killing anyone, they just do it; regardless of whether their target has loot or their ship is freshly spawned. See a sloop in the distance? It's probably already on its way over to you and you'll be sunk in a few minutes. All that loot you spent hours gathering that you're taking to an outpost to sell? It's all undone in a heartbeat if another group of players wants it. This is the pain point that toxic players (pretty much all of the vocal playerbase) will crucify you for if you bring it up at all.

Even worse is that players trying to do story missions (""tall tales"") will be sunk without warning by PVP players. The tall tales that Rare has made available are great fun, and would do well to have their own separate mode away from the toxicity of PVP, but Rare has apparently already firmly made their stance that this will never, ever happen. It's really a toss-up if you're going to get followed by a nasty couple of pirates for your entire session, or if you'll be lucky enough to be left alone for most of it. Again, any time the topic of ""why isn't there instanced tall tales, PVP is ruining this game for me"" is brought up in discussion boards, it will get shot down by absolutely anyone for reasons such as ""balance,"" ""get good,"" and other such annoyances.

When my friends decide to give this game a chance and we really get into a story mission that we enjoy and get sunk twice by the same sloop, completely unprovoked, and then they never want to play the game again, it becomes a textbook example of a badly designed multiplayer game with a tone-deaf development team.

I'll also mention (because this irks me a lot, and I know it's minor) the fact that this is a game that's also released on PC, not just Xbox, and the FOV slider is locked to a maximum of 90 (which is sickening and much better suited to couch gameplay). Luckily, the Steam community found a way to bypass this lock and open the FOV up to a more comfortable level through a config edit. For whatever reason, Rare thought this would give players an unfair advantage (how?), and with the Pirate's Life patch they disabled this fix outright, even boasting about it in the changelog. To spit in the face of a playerbase that is so comfortable with higher FOVs for the sake of ""balance"" in a game that doesn't require competitive integrity whatsoever is just gross.

I guess the toxicity really gets lost in an amalgamation of this game's effort to keep to its theme, like how it has almost no persistent UI elements except for your health bar, and the writing is tastefully mixed in rhymes. Because the playerbase is about as toxic as real pirates would be. It's kind of hilarious.

The only way to have fun in this game is to find players at sea who are new to it, and help them have a good time; because nice players is what this game sorely lacks."

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"I got this based on the massive amounts of positive reviews.  The first 1.5 hours was pretty good.  Standard tutorial to learn the basics on  how things work.  Nice artwork/graphics and it did give a good pirate theme.  Then the first encounter with an other player.  Insta-death.  Then the second.  Another death.  And then the third started shelling the ship.  I did a quick look in the forums to see what I was doing incorrectly.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very unwelcoming game for newcomers which is my first impression of this game."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"I think it's good. I kind of enjoy the grind, but it certainly is NOT for everyone, especially for those who get angry at losing progress. Go into this game with the expectation that you WILL have to defend your booty with your life, as there are plenty of players who are more than willing to take it from you. For example, I recently had a ship sink ours after a difficult Kraken fight, who watched us struggle against the kraken before picking up the leftovers. We lost all our loot, which wasn't much - but enough to make us have to start our long main story quest from the beginning. Sure, sometimes you can play nice with other strangers, but I've seen more hostile interactions then friendly. This game is called Sea of [i]Thieves[/i], after all."

people with motion sickness like me can't play or enjoy the game more than 30 minutes because of how claustrophobic the game is."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"My opinion, I love It  It's really fun especially with friends. A long time ago I didn't like this game, like... I didn't hate It or anything but just didn't wannted to play it, but Not so long time ago I decided to buy this game and  couple of my friends bought It aswell and yeah Me and my friends really like this game.   Some people might like It some not, Atleast I recommend It, but You might not so before you buy this game  
 
                                                         think about these things

1.Consider if you'll have fun playing this game (This might not be easy to know just by looking at some gameplay)

2. As this game Is expensive coming about 40eur Just think about different game that you wanted or other stuff.

3. And If you do decide purchase Sea Of Thieves then Myb wait some time until It goes on sale or If there's summer sale close then just wait till summer sale starts.

Either way, If you decide to buy or not ( A product is worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it )"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"It's an ok game. I played it on the xbox pass for a while with friends and I honestly can't say it's a game I'd play without at least one friend. The gameplay loop is very shallow and the PvE content is a bit bare bones (pun intended.) Basically PvE you run to location, figure out a basic riddle, then dig for treasure. You can then sell this treasure for some in-game cosmetics and congrats you've done the entire PvE loop. There are also some little ""raid""-like islands full of skeletons but the rewards just don't feel like they're worth it.
The community is full of toxic children, so be prepared to be called the r, f, n, and other various words I can't repeat on Steam a lot. You know how the ""Call of Duty"" experience is to have little kids say they slept with your mom and you need to get good? Yeah it's basically that.
PvP is fine, I suppose. The combat is pretty bare-bones that I really don't see myself soloing in this game at all, if ever. 
In the end I can't really recommend this game simply because the combat is shallow and a boring, and that's what you'll be doing half the time. The other half is sailing around, which they did do quite nicely. If you have a group of friends to mess around with, go for it. Otherwise as a solo player I'd give this a pass."

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Its an awesome game but if you dont have a single friend to play with (like me)

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"The most recent patch has disabled the ability to go above 60 vertical FOV, making the game unplayable due to the big ol' motion sickness I get after 30 mins. The new Tall Tales are also broken in each their own way.

Please, do not buy this game at this time."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"With the latest update they removed the only way to get 120 FOV. 
You're now forced to play with a very zoomed in 90 FOV.
Me and a lot of other players get motion sick after just a few minutes of gameplay.
They say that they'll never change this in my latest ticket. 

[u][b]If that wasn't bad enough. Here are more issues.[/b][/u]
- HORRIBLE Hit registration.
- Frequent crashes.
- Frequently get disconnected from the server.
- Long black screens often minutes (Respawn screen)
- Random black screens (Where you just randomly teleport back to your ship)
- Food consumes but doesn't generate health.
- Cursed cannon balls don't work.
- No progress on commendations.
- No rewards for handing in loot and treasure.
- Sensitivity issues because the settings are HORRIBLE.
- Game gets stuck in windowed mode.
- Can't repair mast after pulling it up (meaning you have to wait for it to drop down again and then pull it up to repair)
- F key stops working, meaning you cant interact with ANYTHING. 
- Video glitch where your camera is literally upside down or on the side.

[u][b]And best of all[/b][/u]
My Y-Axis is inverted. I made 4 tickets about this, and all they say is ""Seems to be a glitch/bug""
When I pull down my mouse, my pirate looks up. I've tried everything the support had suggested, still doesn't work.

Do not waste your money on this game unless Rare sells it to a decent developer. 
I'd rather murder my entire family then play this game."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"I absolutely love this game, and was incredibly excited for this update, but the Pirates of the Caribbean update is beyond disappointing. I played the ""Pirates Life"" mission and all my excitement and expectations melted away into disappointment. My biggest surprise is that Disney allowed Microsoft to associate them with such a poor representation of their franchise. That mission felt like it was made by a knock of low budget studio, and everytime I got my hopes up for what seemed like something fun around the corner, I was painfully disappointed. :("
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,Lessened FOV options for steam users.
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"This can be a fun game if you're into PvP and exploring.   The game is beautiful and you can have fun by yourself, however there is some bad stuff.

Bad Stuff - This is stuff that has happened to me more than once, so buyer beware:
You can easily end getting chased for an hour by a toxic group shouting obscenities that just wants to sink you and then hunt you down again and again which really can take the fun out of the game.  If you run a large boat by yourself a group of 2-3 people can join you, put you in the brig and sink your ship out of nowhere.  I've also had players who joined just randomly start throwing treasure you've gathered off the side of the boat while at full sail or try to burn down your ship by cooking a banana.  

The late game is difficult due to 3 hours spent grinding quests to get a chest for little to no reputation.  And if you're running the faction's flag (which gets you more reputation for turning in faction's treasure), players will attempt to hide on your boat to steal it from you.  I also found out that there is a PC cheat that does aimbot and can find ships / loot within a distance that you can't see normally. So a few of those times where a ship came out of nowhere at the end of my run when I had a lot of loot and sank me, I felt it might have happened due to that cheat.

But all in all I had a lot of fun playing the game.  I occasionally met some good chill players to hang out with.  I enjoyed exploring, puzzle solving and the PvE but I could really do without the PvP toxicity and griefing."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Good game to play solo, amazing game to play with friends. Enjoy the pirate life!"

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Super fun game to play with friends.  

Ironically there is a problem in this game of 'wide as an ocean deep as a puddle' in terms of actual game content, however it has been improving massively through the seasons and season 3 looks extremely promising in terms of expanding upon the pvp, pve, and story content in the game.  The game goes on sale all the time so just wait to buy it until then but if you could convince a buddy or two to buy the game with you, you're gonna have a lot of fun.

Would recommend, though only if you have a few friends to play it with."

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Не, внатуре класс"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"It's a great game to waste time on being a pirate and do random tasks.  Not very progressive though since everyone has the same level of weapons, but still fun. Only complaint is the 1st person cartoon view and turbulent seas make me sick."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,good games if you have friends. in my case its a bad game
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Okay. You are reading this review to figure out whether or not this game is worth your time and money. The short answer is yes, it is. Photorealistic waves, big multiplayer sandbox, a whole pirate vibe -- this game is undoubtedly visually pleasing and fun to play. However, there are some trade-offs that Rare took in order to make this multiplayer sandbox work -- some that I agree with and some that I don't. And I don't mind if you argue against my reasoning or are with it, just know that these issues will pop up as you play:

1. Multiplayer. Only. - This game cannot be played offline, as the Sea of Thieves is always meant to be populated. Take this as you will. This game is not fun playing alone. I know some people will beg to differ, but it is objectively better to play with other people. As this game is online only, playing alone will put you at a constant disadvantage, whether it be unfair fights or repairing your ship while trying to steer or having a constant fear of having your treasure stolen. There is an open crew option that teams you up with random people, buuut people rarely ever communicate (a topic I will get to later). I might not be having the best luck with open crews, which is why my experience with them is negative, so take it with a grain of salt. Make sure you play this game with friends or people who will willingly communicate instead of:

2. Fight Now, Talk Later. - I don't know why, but people literally NEVER communicate anything with me unless I have set up a session with someone. There is both a text channel and voice output for PC and Xbox, but almost no one uses it. Most ships out at sea will attack my ship by simply coming into close proximity with it, even if I have no loot and even if I use my microphone and say ""Please don't attack me, you gain nothing from it."" I have played this game for about 40 hours so far, and I have not met any crew that has responded to my requests. And the worst part is that this dehumanizing of other players discourages the communicating players to communicate! If no one cares what I have to say, over time I will turn to self-defense, and gain the upper hand before the enemy gains it... and this is how a toxic community is created.

Please don't only look at the negative here, I am sure there are people who do try to communicate, but most pirates on the Sea of Thieves don't hear you. And if they do, they might just not care. Be prepared to be sunk by jerks.

3. Monetization - Rare, I understand adding a ""Battle Pass"" increases game revenue, and trading in real money for Ancient Coins allows pirates to obtain pets and cool cosmetics... but I already paid for the game! I know Sea of Thieves is part of the Xbox game pass subscription, so it makes sense there, but there is no reason to keep it on the PC versions of the game. This is a ""pay to look cool or spend weeks grinding"" kind of game. I thankfully don't care how I look so I can ignore this part of the game, but I know for some it is a more prominent problem. 

I know I talked only about critiques, so please don't look at this game in a negative light. I have had fun playing this game, and I will most likely continue to. If you take anything away from this, please know that this game is a double-edged sword. It has high pros and medium cons."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"can have shibe

10/10"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"This game definitely provides the full pirate experience. I recommend it!

Playing alone: Hey, it's not all that bad except for being lonely... Having a crew is the best way to go for in this game because you're able to level up faster and enjoy sharing your treasures. Try telling your friends about it so you all could have a lot of fun since after all I was recommended the game. If you want to play this game alone I would still recommend it, especially if you're independent. You still have a good chance of having fun, it even may be more challenging.. but it's just not as good as having your drunken crew

Playing with Friends/Players: So you do have a choice in this game to have ""closed crew"" or ""open crew."" This could depend on whether you want random crew members or personal friends. It's overall more enjoyable and as I said before, faster with xp. 

Buying pets in this game is godly
You might get random sea encounters too
Reapers..
Overall I'd rate it a solid 9/10"

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Sea Of Thieves is possibly the best game to exist!
With good PvP that's based on skill & amazing PvE events, it brings out a good level of play, challenge & learning that you'd expect in a pirate game!
There's many, many, MANY moments that make you feel like Capt. Jack Sparrow, with epic music, random skeleton ships, combat that feels right for pirates, a map that's HUGE and ship management such as; making sure the ships sails are getting a tail wind, repairing after getting hit, making sure the cannons are armed, etc. It feels amazing!
There's a good variety of quests to do as well as quest upgrades at each Alliance area.
Some will have you digging up treasure, killing skeleton's, fishing, hunting for special shipwrecks & fighting ghost ships! 
Overall, having only played 82 hours total, it's been BRILLIANT, can't praise this game enough!

"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"I don't post any reviews, but with whats been happening to me recently in the game, I kinda just feel like I should write one to calm myself down. I got this game a around half a year ago because a friend recommended it to me. I was unsure if I actually wanted the game, as it's not the type of game that I usually play. It was hard for me and my friend to find time playing together, and to this point I have never played in a crew, I'm a solo player, so this review is going to be from a solo players perspective.

Pros:
- Great graphics, the game looks amazing, especially the water
- Huge map with lots of places to explore
- Enough players in a server to make the sea feel alive, but not overcrowded
- Lots to do, quests, tales and more

Cons:
- Lots of bugs (I'll get into that more in a second)
- People are jerks (not the games fault, its just true sometimes)
- Land combat is a little basic
- No saving progression on a quest or tall tale (which is okay, just not when the game crashes)

And now for my experience as a solo player.
After I got the game, I didn't really play it all that much, there wasn't any point in it since I didn't have a crew. The game spent a few months sitting around in my steam library getting dusty until one day, not to long ago, I thought I would give it a try. I started out just sailing around, because why not, but then I actually started doing small easy quests to earn reputation. After a while of doing small quests I learned of the ""Shores of Gold"" tall tale (or something like that, I can't remember the name). The Shores of Gold tall tale is a story line consisting of a lot of smaller quests (I won't spoil it for anybody looking to play it in the future). I started playing through it an was doing pretty well for a solo player, until a day ago. I was now on the ""Wild Rose"" tall tale, which is pretty far into the story line, I think. I spawned into the game and needed to head to Sanctuary Outpost to start the tall tale, the only problem was that it was all the way across the map. I started sailing and after about five to ten minutes, I got caught in the storm that slowly makes its way across the map. This would have delayed me by a few minutes, but before I could make it out of the storm I was attacked by another players ship That I didn't even see until last second. Frustrated, I logged off to cool down for an hour and attempted to reach Sanctuary Outpost again. The game once again spawned me on the same island across the map from Sanctuary Outpost, yay. After a lot of sailing I finally made it, but there was another player ship there, and they sank me. I respawned not to far from Sanctuary this time, and waited near the outpost for the player ship to leave. They sank me again (They were nice about it though, I played music with them while we watched my ship disappear into the water). After that I logged off to cool down again, and on my third attempt to literally just start the tall tale, I actually made it. I played through the tall tale and after about an hour and a half I had everything I needed to finish the tall tale, I just needed to get back to Sanctuary, easy right? I somehow actually survived the sail back to Sanctuary, but this is where the bugs come in. Once I anchored my ship at Sanctuary and hopped onto the island, I noticed that there were no NPC's around. This was strange, there were supposed to be NPCs all over the island, in tents, in shops, in the tavern. I needed to give some items to an NPC to complete the tall tale, but I couldn't. I honestly don't know what happened, There was an NPC skeleton ship not to far away, so idk why the NPCs didn't load in on Sanctuary. I had to log off and lost all my progress from the hour and a half (not including the travelling to Sanctuary). The next day (the day I'm posting this) I logged on to attempt it again. I was halfway through the tall tale, all I needed to do was find the items to return them to Sanctuary. As I neared one of the islands that this item was on I went to put the sales up to slow my ship down. I finish that and pressed the button to stop interacting with the sail but my player became stuck, I couldn't move (I could still hold items from my inventory, but I couldn't interact with them). This wasn't the first time this bug has happened to me, but it was just in such a bad moment. I ended up sailing past the island I needed to be at. Once again frustrated that I wasted an hour, I somehow convinced myself to try one more time. I had to leave the game and and join back in so I could move. I started the tall tale and at a point where I had to return two items to Sanctuary to receive another item that would help me locate what I was looking for. As I sailed up to Sanctuary, I ended up hitting my ship on the dock and needed to repair my hull. I got wood and opened my inventory to pull it out, but It wasn't there. It had to be there because the wood barrel said that I already had max amount of wood in my inventory, but I couldn't even see or interact with that wood. It didn't matter anyway, because the NPCs on Sanctuary once again failed to show up.

I gave up on the tall tale after that, as there's no point in continuously wasting my time just to have all my progress lost. I am sad about it, I already made it this far as a solo player but now I can't get any farther. Would I recommend this game? sure! It's a really cool game with lots of exploration, but as I learned, it also has a lot of flaws. It is probably a lot better with a crew, since you can't really fight other ships alone, but you can still have a very fun experience as a solo player. The game demands a lot a free time in order to play, you won't be able to get stuff done in under thirty minutes. There are a lot of nice players out there who won't attack you for no reason, but then there are those few people who enjoy making you lose everything you had on your ship and forcing you to start over.

 I'm sorry for anybody who had to suffer through my rambling, but I hope it helped somebody :)

Thanks!"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Really wanted to like this game, but second game in struggling to find keys what to do and my crew burn my ship and kill me.  If there was single player so I could learn the ropes i would make more time for it.  2 hours in, just a bad experience all round."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"My best friend suffers motion sickness from this game, fov fix was the way for us to sail more than 20 minutes per session together.
It won't be fun to witness Jack's antics without him. Killed all my hype for this release in a heartbeat."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Sea of Thieves is a painful realization that there aren’t that many pirate games out there.

For people who love the thrill of player vs player combat, this is the perfect game to grab. It is a STUNNINGLY beautiful open world game designed with the mindset that players are going to fight and steal loot from others. You know… like a game full of “Thieves”.

But many people are looking for something like Assassin’s creed Black Flag with friends, meaning a game where you can just jump in with your friends and live out a pirate fantasy without worrying that others can sink you and ruin hours of work at any point.

Sadly, this game isn’t that. It was never designed to be that and it will probably never be that. And that’s a genuine shame. I’m not a PVP player. I suck at aiming, I suck at sword duels and I honestly can’t survive alone without a crewmate that’s better at all the things I’m not.

But i still go back to it because I’m a sucker for its visuals. If I can find a reason to sail those waters again, even if it’s doing something boring like a fetch quest (which is basically all PVE content) I’ll do it. It relaxes me.

I find myself jumping on a solo sloop, grabbing the most straight forward voyage I can find, searching a “The Longest Johns” shanties playlists on Youtube and just sail away. Because this game is THAT gorgeous. And even if some Galleon comes sinks me and ruins all my progress, so be it. The loot was never my priority.

I really hope Ubisoft finishes “Skull and Bones” soon, and I hope it’ll scratch that “just sail with friends with no worries” need that people seem to have."

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"""Ahoy there,

Thank you for your ticket.

The FOV modification for Steam players was never intentional and has been removed in order to restore the intended settings of Sea of Thieves.

There are no intentions to change this in future.

Best regards,
Sea of Thieves - Player Support""

Had fun playing this game for about three weeks before Rare decided to break increasing FOV for PC users and called it a fix. I have issue with decreasing utility and accessibility for one platform to make it ""fair"" for another platform. Narrow field of view gives some eye strain and motion sickness on PC because users are usually much closer to the screen than console users. At least I didn't invest more than a month into this. Uninstalled."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,There is literally no way you can go on Adventure in this game. Let alone try do anything solo. As soon as you think you've made some progress some PVP asshole griefer will fuck you up. There should be an option to turn off PVP because without it you're fucked.
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,Great game to play with friends. Yo ho ho.
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,Words cant describe the epic adventures you will go on with friends in this game... What they can describe however is the frustration you will experience when loosing your whole days work and loot in a drop of the anchor and a few cannon shots. 10 out of 10 would recommend. Make sure you get up after you've been kicked down you'll most likely make more than you loose )) Great Game!!
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Pretty good Pirate Game. Hard to put it down. Looks nice and the water physics are pretty realistic, the best waters I ever see in a game. Yes other players will attack you and take all your loot, unless you are good defending your ship. NPC skull boats will raise from the deeps and will sink your ship. The Krakens and Megalodongs will look for you and Swallow you whole. It's a pirate game what you expect? Every Voyage it's different and the game force you to change you strategies every time. I can't stop playing this game, pretty entertaining. If it's a RARE game it has to be good."

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"a very good game for you to play with your friends,u can have an estimated fifty hours (it's probably more than fifty hours). of playing time until you reach the top level in the game.U can take this game and play five or six hours a day with your friends and have fun"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"As of writing this review I have 74.4 hours played on steam but been playing the game since Closed beta with my Xbox account stating 44 days and 22 hours of game time.

Sea of Thieves is an amazing game, the game is brilliant to play with friends either mucking around or completing voyages or tall tales. Being able to sail your own ship and go off on your own adventures on the Sea of Thieves meeting some friendly and some not so friendly other player who are also on their own journey is great.

Playing since closed Beta I've seen the start of this game for which some people still judge the game on. Yes at launch it wasn't the most detailed game. There were issues with people not finding things to do, this issue has been resolved with tall tales. 

Tall Tales are story missions that take roughly an hour or 2 to complete, as of writing this review there are 11 tall tales and 5 Pirates of the Caribbean Tales which personally I've only done 2 so far as they came out yesterday but they are great, especially the first one with its references to the ride by using the ride's original voice clips.

I recommended this game to everyone I know who plays both Xbox and PC and most have continued to play the game due to its enjoyment.

If you don't have friends who play the game, join the official discord. There are so many crews looking for people for all aspects of the game from fishing to arena (PVP mode).

Sea of Thieves has a bit for everyone, from completionists/achievement hunters like me to casual players who just want to sit on their ship fishing or going on a voyage to find some gold."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,Take what you can give nothing back!!
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Sailing solo after long time not playing this game, meet someone struggle fighting skeleton ship, helping them, they spawn kill me ,yeah great game"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,fuck microsoft store
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"fun with friends i dont have any tho so i havent had as mush fun as possible

is still fun tho"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,monkey and banana
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,besides the sea sickness and the being bad at it I am really enjoying the game.
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,greatest game ever!!!
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"""Ahoy there,

Thank you for your ticket.

The FOV modification for Steam players was never intentional and has been removed in order to restore the intended settings of Sea of Thieves.

There are no intentions to change this in the future.""

shit reply template. They didn't care player. what a useless support"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"This game is actually very fun, explore the islands with your friends, sailing in the middle of the ocean. It's a little confusing when playing alone because basically this game is what you have to play in co-op.
if there is, you should try to buy and play it"

Terraria,Adventure,105600,"I will be brief. I could give a long song and dance about how much I love this game and how good it is, but you've heard it all before. Instead, i'll share the fact that I have 1001 hours logged on this game at the time of writing this review. So I like it at least 1001 hours' worth. In closing: play this game, it is good. Thank you for your time."
Terraria,Adventure,105600,"This game saved my life.

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you Re-Logic."

Terraria is a classic. It has loads of bosses, weapons, armor, items, etc. Their is a thing for everyone in this game. There is a vast building system, a huge combat system, and more. This game is only $10 and it goes on sale often. If you haven't played this game yet, give it a try. It is super cheap, and is one of my favorite games EVER. One con is that their is large amount of rng in this game. Their are a lot of items that are very very rare. However, you don't actually need to grind that much."
Terraria,Adventure,105600,"One of those games that you keep coming back to. So many things to do and really fun with friends, this game will never lose it's charm. Excellent modding community aswell.

Definitely worth more than it's current price."
Terraria,Adventure,105600,Get out of the negative section and buy the game. It's good.

Terraria,Adventure,105600,"At the of me writing this I just beat terraria for the first time and after overlooking everything ive done in this game it is nothing more than a masterpiece for someone who enjoys adventure games. Every weapon feels In its own way almost every item has variations with a total of 3000 Items and over 522 entries in the besticary  . there are many classes that you can play ( I chose mage for my run) with tons of different advancements in weapons that you can pick from their accessories that you can use to boost your damage damage reduction Mana cost and anything of the sort finding out about new items and telling my friends about the progress that I've made through the game some of the most fun that I've had in awhile.  every boss feels like it has a personality,  they all have unique attacks that forces you to change your thinking plan while fighting them. There are tens of NPCs that have unique voice lines and sell you different items that can be used to advance through the game . not to mention the amount of  exploration and customizing that you can do to your world making anything that comes to your mind.  Terraria is a true exploration masterpiece with gems hiding around every corner. 10/10

Terraria,Adventure,105600,"So, my friends and I recently got back into Terraria.

We played For The Worthy in Master Mode with a Large Crimson world. Spent the first dozen hours digging a slightly-sub-surface tunnel from one end of the world to the other, in order to avoid the one-shot green slimes. Eventually, we managed to get from one ocean to the other, by which point we realized that the Crimson had begun to spread, and that we needed to dig a trench around our house. Since all the wood was turning crimson, we needed our own plantation beside our now-floating, Soviet-style apartment complex. Finally, we were ready to take on our first boss, and - after a dozen tries - we killed the totally worthless Slime King.

It only got worse.

We haven't killed the brain; we just got enough tissue samples for tools then left it alone. We killed the Queen Bee by stacking boxes of ~50 exploding bunnies in her boss room, before trying the same tactic for the Wall of Flesh. It took about a hundred attempts for us to actually properly prepare the arena, without some demon detonating it instead of the boss (don't even get me started on getting that many f*cking rabbits). 

The eyes and mouth dodge obstacles.

My friends and I recently stopped playing Terraria."
Terraria,Adventure,105600,I don't like this game

Terraria,Adventure,105600,"So many years gone by, a whole lot of [b]♩ Duh, Duh duh, duh duh duh duh duh, duh ♫[/b]

Would duh duh again with friends.

On a serious note,
I [b]HIGHLY[/b] recommend to just try out Terraria.
It might not be the game for everyone, but it sure grabbed my attention ever since 1.0!

The only ""bad"" part about the game I would say, is the particular first 2/3 hours on a new character/world. It becomes a bit grindy after years of playing Terraria, but if you want to spice up your playing experience further, mods got your back with TModLoader!

I don't have any bias towards singleplayer or multiplayer. since both modes can be very fun. Multiplayer tends to get a bit more chaotic (as it would), but I've had some of my best laughs ever playing with friends and just watching the shenanigans unfold."

Those 659 hours were well spent.
If you're looking for a game with story, you're in the wrong place. The gameplay also isn't incredibly intuitive at first. Thus, the official Terraria wiki will be your friend, it's very helpful and there isn't a plot to be spoiled on. Once you get into the meat of the game (which is, fittingly, around the time you fight the Wall of Flesh), you won't find a better 2D sandbox experience anywhere else. The bosses start to get really fun, the weapon and enemy designs more and more whimsical, and over time, you start to feel a little bit like a god.
The difficulty options are also good, and it can run at least passably on any computer even remotely set up for gaming. The multiplayer netcode can occasionally bug out a little bit, but it's rare and minor enough to not affect the enjoyment of the game.
Also, it's only ten bucks. That's a pittance for a game like this. Get it. You won't regret it."
Terraria,Adventure,105600,"I highly recommend this game. It is a VERY fun game to play. There are SO much bosses, and it has so much replayablility."
Terraria,Adventure,105600,"I've been watching a friend play this and decided to check it out for myself.  Since I don't play too many of these types of games, I do have to get used to it; I was a bit overwhelmed at first.

It's a go at your own pace type game where you can explore and build.  It's quite enjoyable knowing that you can venture down into the unknown to collect items and fight monsters.  I also enjoy the music and how it changes depending on where you are.  Overall, I enjoy it and give it a thumbs up."

Terraria,Adventure,105600,"When I first got Terraria I'll admit I'm a terrible gamer and I struggled a lot. I couldn't even beat the first boss. But after a while I found friends to play with me. And that's when I saw the true magic of Terraria. We'd spend hours and hours each day all working together on our little world beating whatever bosses we could and grinding all these incredible items and the bond we had just grew thanks to this incredible game. My best friend is currently away for a few months and it's really hard for me but I keep playing this game because I know as soon as he comes back we will go right back to this game and have fun together like before. I'm always happy when new people enter this amazing game and honestly I'd be happy to say Terraria has changed my life. I wouldn't have such great bonds with my friends if it wasn't for this masterpeice of a game. Thank you Re-Logic.

The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"Imagine you're working in a 9-5 corporate job, you're done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you're never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar. While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn't the games, its you. ""Its not that games aren't fun anymore, you have gotten older"".

And then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can't wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....""Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?"" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who's dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven't felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that's shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?

And I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feeling I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven't scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""Witcher 3 TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That's how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.

Thank you CD Projekt Red. You guys are a gem. I know its 5 years late and I don't know why it took me 5 years to play this, but better late than never."

The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"The definition of ""MASTERPIECE"" was made for this game!"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"-Silver for monsters. 🗡️

-Steel for humans. ⚔️

-Coin for your Witcher !  💰"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"if I had to choose one game to play for all eternity, this would be my instant and definite choice. there is no better rpg out there than this. (in my opinion)"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"Words can simply not describe how much I love this game, but will certainly do my best:

Characters - Existing characters such as Geralt, Triss, Ciri, Dandelion, Yen, Keira (plus Shani and Regis for the expansions) have been utilized brilliantly from the source material and used so well in the world the game has created, and boy what a world it is! The characters I previously mentioned are probably the ones that stood out for me the most, but to be honest there are so many brilliantly constructed characters (even minor ones like Bart the Rock Troll) that I simply don't know where to even begin... Geralt's interaction with most them is simply brilliant, and the game has so many amazing, memorable moments because of it (including the famous 'drinking game segment' at Kaer Morgen). You also get a logged back story for each character, most of it taken from the books and/or previous games. which is brilliant if, like me, you decided to read the books afterwards or couldn't be bothered playing through the first couple of Witcher games (although I did get through 3 stages of the original game). It's obviously more important to have this as there is alot of stuff in the game that needs back story to elaborate on, weither it be a situation or certain dialogue. Oh yes the dialogue, love love love some of conversations in this game. You can tell alot of thought and effort went into it. The character dialogue for the most part, particularly for Geralt is so complex and funny. As it is with certain other characters mind you, but Geralt's obviously stands out the most

Environment - The graphics and art design for all the environments are simply brilliant, each location had its own distinctive feel and is and absolute joy to explore (I spent about 2 weeks just exploring Skellege's oceans and vast landscapes)

Monsters/Enemies - Such a huge assorted variety, honestly you can never get bored with the variety of enemies you face. I also love that each monster has it's own unique methods of quickly being dispelled, and everytime you discover something a description will pop up in the beast log, breaking up everything into different categories aswell

Story - Soooo gooood. Honestly story elements wise, I don't think any game is going to even come remotely close. Especially given that so many of the side stories actually match, and even sometimes exceed, the complexity and epicness of the main storyline

Combat - Kept interesting through the graphic, stylized fighting and dismemberment. Aswell as the additional use of things like signs and potions. Once again you usually need to use certain combinations of things to kill my monsters more easily, particularly the more defined 'boss level' ones

Expansions - BRILLIANT. Hearts of Stone has truely amazing story and character elements. While Blood and Wine does this on a slightly lower scale but adds another beautiful environment with various new enemies to face

So basically this the best I can do to some up how epic The Witcher 3 is. But honestly, just play the damn game!!!

My Rating for this game - 10/10"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"I don't know how to describe this experience. My steam adventure started with The Witcher: Enhanced Edition game, which allowed me to open a steam account. As a console player, I didn't think I would be a computer player, but the witcher series also made me love computer controls.Also, i played the first two games with computer controls, it was fun, but witcher 3 was a game that made me buy a gamepad.The first two games really felt like I was in the game with their open worlds and quality stories. You know, there are some special games that you feel empty when finished. I guess that's how I feel right now. I tried to explore every part of the world and do side quests as much as I could, but I still couldn't get enough of it. This game is a masterpiece for me as an open world and story. There are missions that balance the border between funny and seriousness very well. It is a game that I started late but never tired of playing. I guess it's like a game series that I will play again and again after a certain time. At least it's worth seeing Geralt again ^^"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,Don't buy on sale. Buy at full price.
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"very elaborate and versatile card game, requires patience and strategic planning, not too easy and not too difficult either, the better you are at the game the more cards you can collect, there's a few side quests about some daughter too idk i didn't pay attention"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"What is the premise of life and how is it intertwined with destiny? Some believe that their existence is to perform grand deeds, whilst others contentedly was little girls in basins, an occupation that I earnestly desire. Geralt was one of these men who had a destiny, a goal to slaughter the mentally handicapped, whilst venturing off to pollinate with their caregivers. His aim and dedication in slaughtering the mentally deficient earnt him the ire of various human rights committees who dubbed him the White Wolf, a name inspired by his peculiar habits of skinning his prey alive, to then don them as a cloak. Geralt’s work was so effective that many, from a petulant child, to a mother, fatigued with cleaning out her handicapped child’s waste, and having to spoon fed him intangible jellies as sustenance, frequently contracted the White Wolf to slaughter whatever mouth drivelling, rabid imbecile was assigned. Often the contractors that hired Geralt to slaughter the handicapped were families, or a fuming neighbour, disgruntled over being nightly woken by a mentally handicapped banshee, slamming together two frying pans at the stroke of midnight, whilst serenading an incoherent, intelligible tune. On other occasions he was assigned high profile contracts, most prominently of them all, was the bellower of Castle Whistlewood, a contract he was issues by an individual who wishes to remain anonymous. 

The bellower of Castle Whislewood, otherwise regarded as Steven Dawson, was a distant relative of Austin Powers and was generally emotionally volatile, mentally decrepit simpleton with Tourette’s and Autism. Frequently the belower would trail after woman and utter guttural howls, coupled in with vehement obscenities such as “Hello Baby” and “Ding Dong”. All Geralt would have to do is attach an inflatable female doll, scantily clad and with a seductive pose, to a cliff face. In theory, the imbecile, observing such a hedonistic toy would wholeheartedly believe that the woman was genuine and as such would rush towards her, tripping along the way and plummeting to his demise. Unfortunately, this was not a typical case. Steven Dawson was the governing monarch of Castle Whistlewood, an enclosed building, barred away from civilisaiton and comprised of solely him and his thralls. His thralls in question were regarded as the NDSP, the National Disability Support Partners and were sworn to defend him to their dying day. This task would be relatively difficult to complete, as the bellower bore an army at his disposal, one that could call for security and otherwise repel an ill prepared assault if need be. Aware of such a fact, Geralt began to psychologically and mentally prepare. To ward of the evil spirits, he clad himself and his blades in the finest baby oils that Poland had to offer. Then he acquired a mallet to crack open the bellowers skull. Alongside the weapon, four shrapnel grenades were concocted, in the event that Geralt would be required to clear out a throng of adversaries. During preparation, Geralt simultaneously observed national disability adverts, as they left him with an inexplicable rage. After his preparation was complete, Geralt consumed a vial of LSD, bearing tinges of methamphetamine and wade his way into the castle. The initial threat that Geralt encountered was at the hands of a busty, smirking and chipper female, who was situated at the front desk. The female, upon sighting Geralt, began grinning manically, exclaiming, “Hi there, my name is Caroline, how may I help you today?” Geralt, could not believe it, this female was attempting to seduce him, he could envision it plain in her eyes, her desire to bear his offspring was ever present. Fortunately, prior to entering the facility he had warded himself from all incantations and trickery and as such saw through her ploy. The female, sensing Geralts reluctance to answer, jubilantly stated, “Hi there, are you aware that this you are in the disability support partners facility?” These words, thank the dear heavens, were the last that she ever uttered, as Geralt, desiring to elude being captivated by the seductress, hurled a shrapnel grenade at her head, likely slaughtering her instantly. Then, withdrawing a sword and raising aloft a Polish flag, he began his ascent into the hagravens fortress that Steven Dawson called home. 

Many of the harlots were slaughtered before Geralt encountered his prey. The man, Steven Dawson, was in the midst of serenading to a photograph of a blonde female. The ballad appeared self improvise, as it bore numerous raunchy lyrics and his personal depraved sexual fantasies. Geralt, being unable to endure the sirens wail for a moment more, crept up behind the bellower and promptly caved in his skull with the matter, whilst piercing his chest with a blade. Thus, the contract of the bellower was completed, with Geralt returning to his contractor with the head as evidence of the deed. Afterwards, Geralt’s reputation in the eyes of the world irrevocably altered. Many perceived him as a hero, shielding civilization from the handicapped, whilst more insidious, clandestine groups, such as the NDSP and the UNESCO vilified Geralt, condemning him on his history of virtuous acts. As such, in completing this contract, Geralt had invoked the rage of various sinister groups. Frequently, Geralt throughout roaming in various realms, such as Temeria, Novigrad and the sort was hounded by priests sent by the Catholic Church, security forces, spokespersons for the United Nations and most mobs of depraved fiends who preached about human rights. In typical Geralt fashion he slaughtered them all, whilst locating their families to seduce and copulate with.

Overall, I appreciate the plot of the Witcher 3 and have immensely enjoyed slaughtering those who are inept at tying their own shoelaces, let along being able to cognitively contemplate. Furthermore, I appreciate the games symbolism by masquerading the handicapped as fearsome abominations, bearing horns, leathery skin, bristling aggression and solely conversing in guttural howls, as it wholly depicts the fact that the handicapped are not genuinely human, but are merely abominations that perpetually teeter along the edge of insanity. In summary, Witcher 3 is a grand game and I endear all onlookers to engage upon it immediately, lest you wish to never engage in your deep rooted, primalistic desires to assault the disabled. Oy Lazare, Lazare. Tuka nis a kazali. Kolko liste po gorrach, tolko zdrave na taz kyshcha. Tervo tuka doydome, Moma momche naydome. Ya momata godete. Ya momcheto zhenete."

The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"[h1] I Just Didn't Like It [/h1]

[b] What I Liked [/b]

The game is beautiful.  At the time the game was released, it was the prettiest game I have ever played.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

Everything else.  The combat felt rigid.  The story felt slow.  I felt like there was a lot of grinding for everything.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I know I am in the minority.  A very, very small minority.  But I just didn't like it.  I wasn't having fun.  I tried multiple times and just couldn't get into it, so I honestly can't recommend it.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"I really wanted to like this game because of the incredible support and praise it gets from thousands of people claiming this game to be, ""The best RPG of all time"". But upon getting this game I was relatively new to the RPG genre, but I have to say this game is so boring. I've put in just about 10 hours so far and I have not had an ounce of fun, it's just a lot of, talk to this guy, go kill this guy, oh he had a secret go back and talk to this guy. Over and over, all the missions felt like copy pastes of the same thing with no real progress into the main story. And if you think ""You just didn't get to the good part"" I'm sorry but a game where I have to put in more than 10 hours to get to the ""Good part"" isn't a game for me. At some point in the future I may come back and play this game again, but as of currently I'll probably never touch it. I really wanted to like this game, I really did, but I just can't force myself to play it."

The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"[h1] One of or THE best games that has ever been created. [/h1]
I don't even know where to start with this. 

The story is AMAZING, it is very exciting yet very calm and tranquil and scenic. 

Continuity details is widespread in the world, each and every story is connected to one another, the feelings you get from completing each quest, each monster, each enemy you slay, is different, there is a certain feeling to it. There is a kind of satisfaction in between defeating the bosses and helping the little bitty problems of farmers, fishermans, hunters to the huge tasks from emperors and kings. 

The interactions between characters are amazing, as such as the dialogs between them, although the way the conversations are held are quite repetitive and bland, they just stand in the same manner each time, and that sometimes quite take you off the immersion. That is the one complaint about this game.

Game mechanics are amazing. The sword play, the movements of characters, and monsters are unique and different to each other. The physics simulation are amazing considering this game is made in 2015 and is now 6 years old. The way how master blacksmiths and armorsmiths provide you equipment suited to where you are at the story, from the swordsmiths of velen to the master sword artisans of skellige. Are amazing they always have what you need, provided you have the coins of course.

The world feels, [b] Lived In [/b] and very immersive,from the way that people are placed around the world and crowded in such a way that makes the immersion even feels more monumental, and true to real life. To the way that even how the characters react to the environment and events that happen in the world, civilians taking shelter under a small tent from the rain to how they react differently after an event has happened such as a death of someone important.

The way the scenery is created is amazing, from the Mountains of Kaer Morhen, Rivers of Velen, Valleys of Skellige are as beautiful as ever. the view, lighting, and the graphics are breathtaking. people at CD Projekt Red did such an amazing work of this game, it is a masterpiece and the experience is worth every penny.

The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"The Witcher 3 is an outstanding game that has passed the test of time. Although by today's standards the gameplay seems a little clunky it still is very enjoyable.
The story is phenomenally written and the voice acting fits perfectly with the characters. The characters also hav such good chemistry with each other. The choices you make as Geralt actually hav an effect on the story and the final outcome. You can even go as far as to chose which girl to bang/not bang. The game really makes you feel in control of whatever outcome you get. And thats one of the reasons i love it.
The Combat and gameplay are polished and feel unique. So many good boss fights and mini bosses that are challenging but fun at the same time. Some of my fav boss fights were in the Hearts of Stone DLC cuz they were much different from the usual enemies you fought in the world. Other than that, the way that the handle everything is just so well done. I wouldn't say that the game is perfect but in a way, its imperfections make it a more enjoyable experience.
If it wasn't obvious already, i highly recommend this game even if u havent played the first 2 games cuz this game is a real masterpiece. 9/10"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"I finished Cyberpunk completely in about 100 hours but I still have a long way to go in Blood and Wine expansion even after 130 hours and I'm still not tired of it yet. Really love how the DLCs brought in extra functions, Blood and Wine could have been a game by itself. This is one of the best games I have ever played."

[b]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Game of the Year Edition Review[/b]
(Played on Blood & Broken Bones, the second hardest difficulty)

[u][b]Summary:[/b][/u]
An action RPG with elements of open world exploration, hack and slash combat, crafting, inventory management, a fully fleshed out card game and topped off by an amazingly well told story with great characters, The Witcher 3 throws everything at the player and the result is an experience like no other. 

[u][b]Should you buy this?[/b][/u]
Definitely. The Game of the Year edition is worth the full price, and a steal on sale. 

[u][b]The Review:[/b][/u]
Instead of focusing on the different aspects of the game and why they’re great (something that every other review has done already), I’ll just give you a quick run down of the pros of the game and the DLC content from the Game of the Year edition.

[u]The Pros:[/u]

•	Beautifully designed open world
•	Great story and characters (with one exception, which I’ll get to later)
•	Great soundtrack (Banana Tiger anyone?)
•	Well-designed combat, with every monster having different weaknesses to spells and potions, which you can use to your advantage to get an upper hand or ignore entirely and just go charging in
•	The two paid expansions, Hearts of Stone and Blood & Wine (both included in the Game of the Year edition) are full of interesting and well written characters. Hearts of Stone has the most well written quests in the game bar none and Blood & Wine adds a full new area with new enemies and upgrades to flesh out the game even further.

[u]The Cons-[/u]

Yes, the game has a few drawbacks, but most of these are not game-breaking and won’t make you refund the game. But some of them might get irritating after dozens of hours of playing, so I’ll just mention them.
•	The biggest complaint I have is Roach’s handling. Roach, your horse, is your only means of exploring the world fast. However, he is very prone to getting stuck on loose rocks and uneven terrain, which gets annoying fast when you’re trying to get anywhere fast. He will also come to a dead stop in front of any drops greater than 5 feet, which becomes a big issue in the game’s second locale, a mountainous isle filled to the brim with cliffs and drops. This gets so bad the devs added a quest in an expansion where they make fun of the handling (cute, but kinda exasperating)
•	Speaking of water, Geralt can only defend himself underwater with a slow crossbow. This again becomes a big issue in the game’s second locale, where a ton of collectibles are located underwater. This forces you to row a destructible boat to the places you want to go to and use the slow crossbow to stop monsters from destroying the boat.
•	The game has some bugs after all these years, like how after visiting and leaving a city, your horse won’t be able to sprint, forcing a reload. On a few rare occasions, the game just crashed to desktop out of nowhere. 
•	One final nitpick I had with the game was in the ending to the main quest. Without spoiling too much, it feels like the final “save the world from apocalypse” angle comes out of nowhere, because the whole campaign before that point has focused entirely on Geralt’s search for Ciri and their efforts to deal with her pursuers once and for all. 

[u][b]Final Words:[/b][/u]
The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is well worth your time and money. This game is pure excellence and you should buy the Game of the Year edition to get the full experience."

The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,Amazing game. Would recommend playing the firstones before but you don't realy have to. The game might feel a bit clumsy from time to time but what can you except from a big open world game. It's not even close for example oblivion levels but it is  still a bit anoying sometimes. In the end the overal gameplay is good and enjoyable in every way.
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"Just buy it. RPG in its true essence. Amazing graphics, rich story with deep characters and decent game play."
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,My fave
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"Well well, I don't think you need to read a review to buy this game. This game here on earth is a FANTASTIC game ever made(Thanks to CD PROJECT RED)!!

But if you are the one like me, who never came across witcher game earlier, then I must suggest you should play TW2(The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings) first. It will give you enough reasons to play this game(TW3). If still not convinced yet, see the WITCHER web-series on Netflix. I don't think after that you will have any more doubt regarding your willingness to play this game.

About gameplay and all, it's same old stuff from previous versions except some crispy game mechanics!! least I would say, you will like it for sure. And it's the true role play game as you can decide fate of the others and guess what? even yourself's !! :p 

Also there are still some bugs even after so many patches which are annoying but hey, no game is there without a single bug in them that never get fixed !! haha!!

Graphics is very well detailed. Consider my in-game screenshots on my profile for better reference if require.

So, in my opinion Go for it. wait for the sales and buy it or if you are too excited to play then buy now. Choice is all your my mate!! 

See you in the game ;)"

The Forest,Adventure,242760,really good and fun to play with friends that chop trees near your structures and suddenly the structure is gone hmmmmmm
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"Trust me, you'll have a good time! If not a good time than at the very least you'll piss your pants. What more could you want?"
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"If you want a good multiplayer survival game where you can hear your friend shriek like a little girl upon seeing a monster he's never seen before, this is the game for you.  This game has a unique crafting system where you can glue teeth to an axe for extra damage. The building in the game is also nice because you can plant a diagram of what you'd like to build before you add the components. You can fight cannibalism with cannibalism by eating the limbs of your fallen foes and becoming unhinged enough to craft statues out of their corpses."
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"This game saved my life.

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The Forest,Adventure,242760,u can commit mass deforestation therefore good game
The Forest,Adventure,242760,Very good game :)
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"i love to play idk what to say xD
this game is good btw"
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"I loved the forest! (bug/glitch disclaimers later)
I had watched several play-throughs of the forest and I had always wanted to play it, so my friends and I decided to finally try it. 
I am so glad that I finally decided to buy it. While the game definitely needs some refinement, I still greatly enjoyed it. I love the realistic deadly aspects of starvation, thirst, hypothermia (in cold areas), and drowning while also having to fight off cannibals/mutants. This game continued to keep me on my toes and surprise me, even 50 days in ;) 
Details like using your survival book to craft or update your progress in the game really helped with the immersion and it really felt like you were surviving on stranded island. 
The things you were able to build were so cool and I really enjoyed building as much as exploring/surviving. 
The lore was also very complete, tied together, and clear about the history of the island, and what happened. In that sense, the story does feel very finished. The ending was also very unexpected. 
Now the downsides. While the building system is fine, this game's crafting system is less than optimal. Instead of having a few pages in the book of things you can potentially craft, you have to place items in your inventory space and hover over it to see what you could craft using it. I think this system is user-unfriendly because I didn't know I could craft a rock bag until before the end game because I only collected boar skins for a warmsuit and didn't check for other uses till then. I'll admit, it is a weird crafting system to teach to your friends joining for the first time. 
The other problem with this game is the number of bugs and glitches you may run into. I had to do a lot of googling while playing this game so I'll save some of you the trouble. 
[list]Common bugs/glitches we ran into in multiplayer that you probably will have as well:

[*]Cache photo 8 (named cache photo 9) cannot be picked up. It is found inside a tent in cave 2.
[*]In multiplayer, explosive site/cache 1 may be already exploded and you will not be able to get the pieces to [spoiler]craft the flintlock pistol[/spoiler].
[*]Steam multiplayer achievements are completely bugged out, so non-hosts will most likely not be able to get the achievements for killing a bunny, shark, or bird without going in single player. The same goes for the achievements for repairing a shelter, ""building a long wall"" (you can just place blueprints in singleplayer), killed a downed enemy with a rock, and catch a fish with a fish trap. All the other achievements worked fine in multiplayer though. :) (some too well)
[*][b]When doing the end-game cutscenes in multiplayer, make sure to have the same person do all the cutscenes.[/b] The keycard swipe ""cuts"" are not included in this, but it does matter for two major end-game cutscenes: [spoiler]opening the obelisk[/spoiler]and[spoiler]approaching Megan in the large hall [/spoiler]. So make sure to have the same person initiate those scenes. Otherwise the player to initiate the last part may get teleported to the first cutscene and get glitched into a wall, missing the [spoiler]boss fight[/spoiler] entirely. 
[*]If you got glitched under a platform/structure just place a log cart within reach and the person stuck should be able to grab it and phase through the wood beams. 
[/list]
The game definitely needs some bug fixes and refinement, but the game itself is still enjoyable and interesting despite all these problems. If you like survival games, the forest will offer its own unique and interesting take on this genre that you need to see to completion."
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"this game is very cool , and has naked women in it"
The Forest,Adventure,242760,forest
The Forest,Adventure,242760,I'm lost and I hear strange sounds
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"Story, Gameplay, Graphics, these are three basic points which a great game should contain. ""The Forest"" undoubtedly has an attractive story and you have multiple ways to immerse yourself in characters and want to continue playing to see how the story is going. While game graphics is important, it doesn't always represent a game. At least I think I can still have a well play experience in this game.

The amazing thing is that it shows me what is called Human Nature.""Thinking about human nature is the equivalent of our whole species looking in the mirror to check its identity."" And that is ""The Forest"" was going to do, it pushes us for making our own choices. I was required to make a hard decision between my dear and even someone who didn't have a name for me when I approached the end of story. I need to say it's a really meaningful experince in my whole game life.

And I think you must have realized what is the most precious in your heart when you finished the game.

Don't be confused with your decision, EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE CHOICES! To my understanding, there's no true or false when you're in dangerous, all we need to do is attempt to survive and protect what we love. And that's enough. Don't think too much, just take pride in your efforts."
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"[h1] 7.5/10 [/h1]

Well polished

[b] How is it different from other crafting-survival-open(ish) world games: [/b]

Enemies having notably more complex movement and behaviour but might still get stuck sometimes.

A touch of realism. However, food related stuff is nowhere as complex as green hell

The map is hand crafted, so the caves are very unique to this game. Extremely well detailed, lighting is done well but it is too dim, it looks proper when gamma is increased to max.

Horror - It is not scary like horror games, nor is peaceful - In between.

Items and loot - They are not really shared. If there is a duct tape lying in the ground, individual players can take a copy each. Loot is per player. All loot is pre set so there is no issue of one player getting better loot.
To transfer items to another player you have to craft the item with a metal tray (this is available at the start of the game) and show it to the other player and he grabs it. 

[h1] Other good things: [/h1]

Well optimized
Story is good but kinda short (15h for just story, will take more for all achievements/other side ""missions"")
Combat is good. It never gets dry. 

[h1] Some bad things: [/h1]

Transferring items to players is tedious if you are transferring a lot of number of items

The night sleep cycle - There is a cooldown for sleeping. This sucks because if you miss your right time of sleep you are gonna have to either not sleep for the next day (so you can sleep at the right time the day after) or have all your nights sleep late because the cooldown does not end at the right time of sleep

[h1] Get it on a sale, preferably with friends. Will be kinda scary singleplayer. The sequel will come out sometime soon (""Sons of the forest"") [/h1]"

The Forest,Adventure,242760,"I like the freedom of play in this game. I am too chicken to have tried it on normal mode but peaceful mode is very fulfilling if you enjoy building and/or survivalist games. It is a graphic game so if you find yourself sensitive to hunting for survival, I would not recommend this for you."
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"It's likely to be the best out of all the 'survival craft' genre games out there along with Subnautica. Even though It loses the danger element very fast imo by allowing you to easily kill the threat and even making a nice roast out of it, which translates to it being more often funny than scary, but entertaining nevertheless if you play with friends. 

My favorite way of enjoying this game is roleplaying as a Portuguese colonist arriving on the uncharted lands of brazil and slaughtering the natives with no mercy, then feasting on their flesh as payback for slaughtering my language. 

Overall 8/10 pretty good and the tree chopping is super immersive"
The Forest,Adventure,242760,kinda fuckin good man idk
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"This is an amazing game and I love it dearly.  It can be scary at times to comedic at others with seemingly no shortage of fun!  But unfortunately the fun will end eventually and you will be left feeling more hollow than when your girlfriend leaves you for not fulfilling her ridiculous standards that are too high to constantly maintain.  Susan, baby, please take me back.  We can work this out.  I miss you and no amount of Double Stuff Oreo's TM will fill this hollow hole that has made residence within my heart.  Now buckle your seat belt boys and girls, for it is currently 1:21 AM and I'm about to write a thing or two about this game while barely awake.

The Good:
- You can kill the forest and make Smokey the Bear mad
- You can play with body parts
- Killing innocent animals to fuel your psychopathic tendencies is always a plus
- You can eat the innocent animals.  Screw veganism
- Become a dentist that uses malpractice to collect teeth and attach them to your ax to deal extra damage! Pretty metal
- Game gets harder the more you piss the forest off
- Play fetch with the natives which also piss them off somehow
- You can build your dream home!  But this will piss of the natives and they will send the metaphoric manifestation of my sisters attitude after you
- Starving has never felt more realistic!

The Bad:
- It's real easy to piss the forest off.  PR for dying is a few in game minutes
- No guns except flintlock pistol.  I guess the cannibals are the British and they keep raising my taxes.
- Game gets stale like an open bag of bread after a while
- Updates are as frequent as visits from my dad

My Personal Favorites:
- Bond with friends as you explore a beautiful island full of wonder, only for an aborted fetus that has grown to the size of Shrek hunt you down and slaughter you for existing
- Hearing your friends scream with terror.  That will happen a lot
- Being able to practice your swing when baby cannibals leap at you like demented frogs.  Weird feature, but a loved feature
- Pissing off the natives and being surprised for when they attack you and then using this as justification to slaughter them to extinction.  So this is what it felt like when my ancestors took over the new world
- Watch as the cannibals won't give two ****'s for killing a male but go berserk for looking at a female.  And they say chivalry is dead

Verdict:
A fun, family experience that will bring countless laughs and heartwarming moments.  I cannot recommend a better game to hook-up to VR and force grandma to play.  You will be filled with joy as you get to witness first hand her excitement and happiness.  Or the money from her will as she inevitably dies from a heart attack when an 18 armed monstrosity that has the attitude of a vegan curb-stomps her"

The Forest,Adventure,242760,"I'd rather give it a ""neutral"" grade.

It has crafting, and some story. I played in coop and we've built a great camp after many ours.
Yet it quickly started to feel boring, meeting a point where extra grinding gives a small upgrade, but nothing actually new.
Building construction feels pretty standard, and as such ""sufficient"", but not fancy to actually entertain.
The map is moderately large, and yet it is looking the same everywhere (yeah, like in reality, but not gameplay-interesting).

It feels like the game stuck in beta, planning to add more features, yet it never did.

It is amazing to play with friends or alone, and can kinda be as challenging as you want it to be (i.e play the basics or get every little thing out in the ocean caves) - it is also extremely re-playable, more so than other survival games like it. Kinda terrifying sometimes not gonna lie, and getting smooshed by a tree falling on you because your mate didn't yell out ""oh by the way THERE'S A TREE ABOUT TO FALL ON YOU"" can be annoying, but seriously its one of the funniest games ive played. 100% would recommend this, i really enjoyed it."

""Come and get it"", I scream and taunt!

I've got a hatchet and it's aflame,
""Die MotherF**kers!"" I exclaim!
Relentless harassment, day and night,
But I don't care, I'll continue to fight.

They try to eat me; I actually eat them,
My previous morals I have to condemn.
I want my kid - I want to go home,

Even though I gifted them the game and they tried to help me to finish the game but I'm still scared going down further below. So I just chill at the wilderness and wait for them to finish it.

ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,dinosaurs poop in this game
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I desperately want to like this game. On paper, it's everything I could ask for. Dinosaurs and prehistoric beasts! Taming, equipping, feeding them! Going exploring with epic mounts and hunting companions! Gradually building up a base that rivals the grandest of fortresses!

I want to like this game, but it's just too damn buggy. I was able to tolerate it for a while, where it would be frustrating but I could deal. The lost dinosaurs, the clipping, the stupid deaths, the building issues, whatever.

But then my prized Sarcosuchus ended up instantly dying when I was swimming and happened to brush the shoreline. I was very upset, but I went out and captured another one. Then, about five minutes after taming the new one, the exact same thing happened again.

It turns out the the Sarcosuchus's natural sprint speed is fast enough that it insta-kills it if it touches the shoreline, because for some reason the sprint speed is converted to fall damage. The solution to this bug? Just don't sprint, or don't use the Sarcosuchus. A known issue since 2018 that far as I know still hasn't been fixed. Just one of many user complaints that have not been addressed, and it was the last straw for me.

There's so much to like in this game, but the lack of polish just ends up ruining the experience. And it's such a tragedy, because this could really have been my most played game of all time."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I still remember the first time I played this game. I started out on a solo server. Had no clue what I was doing since there was no tutorial at the time, and the game was in early stages. Chain died to dilo's, raptors. Made a small shit shack out of wood. Huddled in a dark corner in pitch darkness hoping my stuff wasn't going to get destroyed by the raptors outside. Fought my way through them by cheesing them using elevation to my advantage. Found my first high lvl dino 120 trike (Max lvl at the time). Took 6 hours to tame with hand picked berries and narcotics to try and keep it down. More raptors kept spawning and trying to get at my trike buddy, but I prevailed. Tamed out only a few levels higher, due to harassment from the raptors. That thing was a beast, ripped through alpha raptors with constant knock back. Killed tons of carnos. Until an alpha rex snuck up on me in pitch darkness and ate my poor buddy. 

I thought I was ready for pvp after that experience gained. Spawned on the beach and went for the same spot to build my wood shack. At the time the alpha tribe of the server was pretty close (Server 1) Veras Vanguard. They came with argies and forcefully told me to relocate my shit shack somewhere else. I said NAH! Instantly picked off by the argy and went for a ride of a life time from a cliff to my death. I chucked a few sling shot rocks at their dinos and killed a few of them off. Merely to be a pest in my sorrow because of my base being ruined. 

This was when I realized to make it anywhere in pvp I must join a tribe to survive. At the time I heard Spartans was a big tribe and Barrys Seals. I felt more welcome in Seals, so that's where my pvp experience began. Raiding other mega tribes, killing countless dinos and players. That's what makes this game great, playing it with other people and creating a community around it.

Ark as a game is a rollercoaster ride. You always have your ups and downs. It's the best survival game I have ever played. The others don't come close to it. The things that make this game so epic is when you think you made it far and can't possibly be killed ark will always say ""Hold my beer"" as it proceeds to reap your soul from your body with a carefully planted troodon. Or an underwater scorpion that knocks you out before you could even shit your pants. Or another player sneaking up on you and smacking you over the head with a club. 

I started on pvp server and ignored the story completely. From a beach bob to a semi-big tribe to a mega. Each had its stories and community of people. Made some friends, enemies which both lead to epic battles.

This game has its share of countless bugs, I wish the developers spent more time fixing those before proceeding to create more content and DLC's. 

As a whole I would recommend this game to people, but know what kind of player you are. PVP is mostly for people who have a large community and can take turns looking after bases, and mostly ignore the story of the game. PvE is more geared for casual players who don't have the time to maintain bases against others and just want to experience the story of the game or RP away with mods.

"
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,This is a fun game i love the concept of it and the curve balls they put in this game is really good graphics and is worth buying
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Oh man, this game is great. Learn to live with lag and frame drops. Do not enable damage numbers unless you hate your PC. Inbreed your favourite dogs to make the best boy dogs. Spend all your day trying to get your dinosaurs organised and have it all destroyed by a fat-fingered tribemate.

But have you ever seen a baby otter? 5/5 stars."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Note: I play on official (PvE) servers. If you pick up this game I recommend looking for a private server or renting your own. Can be fun and has a lot of potential but I can't give it a positive review for the official server experience- for a game that requires a huge amount of time to be sunk in to progress, it's beyond frustrating that you can lose literally hundreds of hours of work to bugs and random server glitches. GMs will try to be helpful (if they respond at all), but you'll likely be told there is nothing that can be done. Servers are insanely laggy, especially on world-save intervals, and you will likely have multiple crashes and rollbacks a day depending on which server you are on. It's not uncommon for a server to go down for days at a time.

Recently my tribe had half of our cryofridges go dead despite being powered and on the same grid as others that were fine and fully charged, and we lost all the dinos (hundreds in total) in them. Might not be a big deal for larger tribes with more people who can recover more easily, but we are only two people. Losing a fridge full of Gigas we had raised and fully imprinted was a huge bummer, not to mention a bunch of event color dinos that we won't have access to for another year.

Bugs like that and many more have been documented for years now and they *still* exist, that's pretty unacceptable given how much of a grind it is to do anything in ARK. I see the appeal in the game, and I might still play casually... but I'm no longer sinking that time and dedication into a game that will only fuck me over in the long run, and I won't be buying ARK 2 unless Wildcard really turn themselves around. Such a shame since it's really a very fun concept, but there are many other open-world survival games out there that are stable and are much more deserving of your time and energy."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Would you like to play on servers where every single source of metal is blocked by an indestructible metal pillar? Want to lose months of progress because you got bombed overnight? Want to spend every waking hour checking into ARK to make sure your tames didn't get killed, only to eventually realize the game isn't even fun now - it's just work? Do you enjoy constant crashes, gamebreaking bugs, and low fps? ARK is the game for you!

Edit: Looks like Ark is on sale at 10 dollars at the moment. While I don't think ARK is worth the full $50, it's definitely worth it at $10"
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I'd recommend this game but with some caveats, but we'll get to that.

First and foremost: survival game with dinosaurs, multiplayer, base-building and optionally PvP. Heck yes.
I don't like spoiling things too much, but dinosaurs and animals are a core part of the player's engagement in the game, not just the enemies of the world you have to deal with.

However, the game is sometimes extremely rough around the edges.

Having played this as a dino fan myself and with a dino freak friend, we could look past the issues of jankiness, but it did definitely test my patience at times.

If you're the type of player who can look past some flaws and stick with a game simply due to the theme or feel appealing to you more than usual, I'd recommend giving this a go.
If, on the other hand, polish, quality and user experience are paramount, maybe try this at a deep deep sale or simply do not even pick it up.

If you do decide to pick it up, ask around for a friend who knows their way around all the different map options and server parameters etc. because those can also very much change your experience, and make or break the game for you!

As an exemple, the first map I tried out made me want to get a refund, but with some research and setting up, I've had the time of my life in the Ragnarok map.

Dinos are cool."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,Remember do not play official server
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"The learning curve on this game is EXTREME. There is virtually no in game guide on what your first few hours in the game should look like, and even online videos are not that helpful. Once you get past the initial steep learning curve on how to actually progress through the game, it is quite enjoyable. There is so much detail in every map, dinosaur, and land feature. The possibilities in this game are truly endless and unique and there is a lot to enjoy in this game. 7/10"

ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,Toxic community and greedy devs are more concerned with releasing game-breaking DLC than fixing game breaking bugs
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I thought that this game looked dumb, some half dressed woman ridding on a dino, but, once I had played it for over an hour I knew it was going to be one of my very favorite games of all times. And it is. It truly is an amazing game as far as survival and exploration, and if you like dinosaurs its a huge bonus."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"fun game, i recommend it. what i DON'T reccomend is exiting the window while on the loading screen, since it completely freezes the game."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Expectantly disappointing

     It is an mmo after all, much of the experience is derived from the other players of the game and although I have made some friends through playing I don't think I could recommend this game to people for the following criticism: extreme unbalance in public servers. Making dinos transferable is one of the worst decisions made by the ark team and although it is available to be turned off in server settings, many if not all of the official serves do not do so. This doesn't seem like a problem until someone from another server comes in with a end game, max level dino, flattens a whole server and then leaves again in a raid style. For this very reason people flock to dead servers to try to build up then go raid another server and then return to their 'safe' server where they can't be touched.

     In terms of performance, the game runs fine, if resource heavy. Graphics are alright, other than the blinding bloom and sun shafts, which cannot be adjusted to my knowledge other than through the gamma level and can be prevented from being adjusted server-side.

     For play with a group of friends on your own server, I think this game could be perfect, but it is not viable to play with the general public as of this very moment."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,haha dino go grrrrrrrrr
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"1) ark features physically and mentally unhealthy game design in the taming, breeding and farming systems. 

2) the pvp community is among the most toxic spaces that i have ever experienced. this is a problem that wildcard can impact by attentively banning people for harassment, something that they plainly in doing relative to the standards that other games currently uphold.

3) rampant QC issues. there are holes in the mesh. there are aimbots. there are vision hacks. there are dupe bugs. the pvp servers of ark have been in a state for years where your tribe has two choices: either cheat (duping, primarily) or be a ""beta tribe"" of a tribe that does cheat. there is no other way to survive on pvp.

i think it's reasonable to play the game despite #3. just about every game has bugs and if the game is fun enough a lot of people are willing to deal with just about anything. however #1 and #2 are so damaging to the prospective player that i would not recommend this game to anyone."

ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I love survival games and this is better than The Forest
I enjoyed it so far let's see if i can play it for the next 300 hours"
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I've owned this game for years now, and have played it on and off. Ark is a very time consuming game with a large amount of opportunities for gamers to do whatever they please. You can tame virtually any creature you find in this game, ride quite a lot of them, and breed them. There is a lot of challenges, a storyline, and you have to do quite a lot of resource gathering. There is a lot that I do like about this game, it is very fun, and I do recommend it, however, it's important that anyone considering to buy this game reads the negatives about it which I will list below. This is only some of the negatives that I found to be important to note. These made my time with ark irritating to an extent. Besides these, the ark is a wonderful game. There's a lot to do, and it's hard to get bored. I would suggest taking a look at videos on youtube of this game so you can see the more positive aspects of it, as I will be listing a lot of negatives below.

First of all, I would like to mention how poorly optimized this game is. The ark can easily take over 250gb of memory just with the base game alone (+installing mods). Not to mention, DLCs add onto that. The amount of space this game requires is beyond reasonable. Each time the game has an update, the gb count is enormous, and at many points in time, I had no space for this game so I had to uninstall. If you don't have a minimum of 500 free gb, you should, because the ark will most likely end up asking you for that much, or even more. The ark team has done seemingly nothing to optimize their game and make it easier for people to play and download. 

Another thing I would like to mention is the fact that building is awful in this game. As someone who likes to build, and often does it, the building system implemented in this game basically makes you rage quit. This has been an issue for as long as I can remember, and it makes building very frustrating. Want to place a wall? Ha, you thought you could? Ark has a system where building materials snap together. If you want to place a wall for example, you have to place it on a platform first. Often times, you can't snap things to the platform, when you're supposed to be able to. But don't worry, there's a way to get around this. But it is incredibly painful and time consuming. What is very disappointing about this game is the fact that this has always been an issue. Building has always been an incredibly difficult task when it should be easy, but that's simply because the devs never chose to fix it. Instead, they come out with new DLCs and ignore the important bugs needing to be fixed. This is apparent in not just building, but very noticeable bugs in creatures. Building is an essential part of this game, the fact that something so important hasn't been fixed for many many years is astounding. 

If you start off in your own private world, it's important to know that you need to tweak your settings for the world. Ark's base settings are so ridiculous that you will never be able to do anything. Taming, using the base settings, can literally take you days- if you don't mess up or the dinosaur dies. It could take longer. I often try taming Equus (Horses), and they will take me literally hours using base settings. You might think this isn't that bad, but when you consider what you have to do for that, it is. You ride a horse for hours straight, feeding it. If you mess up, the horse will dismount you and you lose a lot of your progress and have to restart. Not to mention, if you didn't mess up, the taming process takes hours. Imagine if you do mess up, it isn't worth it. Unless you want to take days to tame anything, I highly suggest adjusting your settings to make it so taming is much quicker, amongst other settings available, like egg incubating and newborn aging for example. Oh, which I should mention, newborn creatures often require a lot of food in a very short period of time, alongside animals that you tame. So when you are quite literally waiting days, you aren't just waiting. You're feeding them even few minutes, gathering the food, and also making sure that they remain unconscious by using narcotics or narcoberries. It's a constant chore that takes way too long to accomplish.  

PVP can be very agonizing. Like I said earlier, taming creatures in this game is intense. It requires a lot of hours and a lot of servers often make you wait a decent amount of time for taming. When you're in a pvp setting, anyone can come along, raid you, and kill all your hours work of taming. I don't enjoy PVP for this reason, because I don't like the idea of taking hours to tame something, for some random creature or person to come along and kill them in an instant. 

There are other issues with this game too, but if I were to note them all the review would be too long. So if you are considering this game, I do suggest it as it is worth your money, however, be wary of the negatives. The game itself is incredibly fun, and if you can get past those hinderances, it will be something to return to time after time again. There is always something to do in ark, the amount of content in this game is remarkable. There is just things the devs don't care about fixing, but in the end, it doesn't ruin the game as a whole, just makes it a bit annoying. 

Now I must go ride a bugged Thylacoleo up a cliff."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Gen2 last DLC is so fukced up! Started without cap player. And it as 150+ player in a server, after a patched, now it doing the cap. Totally unfair without any news for it! No suggest to buy or play it! So failed of last DLC!
"
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"First i have to say - its a good fun game.
many ppl have hours and hours playing it for good reasons, but i cant recommend it i just cant.

lets start with this - genesis 2 was released 2 days ago, for the first 2 days everyone could log in to the servers no matter the server limit. so server had 100/70 players.
ppl built bases tamed dinos and got to a nice point.
now they updated and ""fixed a bug allowing players to join over the limit"" and ppl from all over the world spend hours and hours trying to join the game. 
i talked to ppl in the ARK discord saying they tried to connect for 12 hours and they cant play.
keep in mind some builds have 12-16 hours until they decay if you or your tribe does not connect.
---this is just from now.

during my time playing i've had encountered bugs that a short google search showed date back 4-5 years with no answer or fix from the devs.

support help - is just irrelevant:
---if you raise a dino you get to ""imprint it"" so lets say giga takes about 9 days (used to be 11) and you need to imprint every 8 hours to reach 100% (you can cryo to pause it but that means it'll be useable after alot longer then 9 days)
then a bug makes you lose this 100% imprinted giga - level 350 mutated to have 900+ melee to which support says we will spawn you a lvl 201 giga with no imprint bonus (30% attack and resistance) and random stats (i got 115% melee on that).
---support will not spawn back any equipment lost from bugs, or from accidental character deletion (from servers falling)
---if you lose a character - you will send a ticket and get to set an apointment with support - for 1 month ahead, but - they will not give back extra levels gained by completing bosses,  if you were the owner of a tribe you need 3 admins to verify that to get that ""ownership"" back - until which your crew will have no owner. if you are alone - that 1 month will result in all you base and building decaying, even if you can reach it with new made character and see its about to depsawn you cant do anything other then plead the support team to help you sooner. i know 2 ppl had their entire base decaying cause the support team didnt answer further then set an appointment.

theres much more to be told. but i believe you get the picture.
i enjoy playing it, i got screwed by bugs more then a few times to the point i have alts in my tribe and on different servers so i can always play and keep my stuff running, i raise 6 or 7 dinos of a certain type each time so if i lose one for bugs i have replacements. when i do something i know is bugged i dont take anything i cant replace on me cause i lost all equipment many times to bugs. - thats shouldn't be a gamers concern when playing a game running since 2015.

if you are not bothered by bugs and devs ignoring you  - it really is a good game. 
but be sure you are going to encouter annoying bugs and problems with playing and connections.

ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Really good game with amazing graphic, lot of things to do here and its pretty fun to play with friends too. But it also takes so much time, its insane tho. I really like how creative u can be there, how many thing u can explore. Amazing animations and every creature looks awesome (sooo many details).  One thing I really hate on this game is PVP, which takes even more, more time. U have to be there every day so u can check if everything is ok. Even when u have big tribe. So many of toxic people, and after new updates with dinosaurs its pretty unfair too. So I would say that PVE is much better than PVP and in PVE u can actually enjoy this game (in my opinion!). So except PVP I have nothing to complain about :)."

Its just not worth the hassle anymore."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Ark is a game that you love to hate.  It's packed full of bugs, patches tends to break things, DLC's are always late and released running poorly.   However, every single one of us shove money at Wildcard and sink endless hours into this game. (I have over 5,500 hours of play time on Xbox, just started playing on steam at the end of March 2021)

You gotta take the bad with the good.  This game is a blast solo or with friends, there is no right/wrong way to play, it's so opened ended for you to figure out what YOU like, how you like to do it and what makes you happy! Don't let other tell you how to play.  Turn the Ark into your own fun world!

Solo, Official, Private Servers, etc this game has so much to offer and before you know it you as well will be addicted to Ark but complaining about it every chance that you get.

I do suggest grabbing it when it is on sale! Don't pay the triple A prices. -_- So not worth that chunk of money.

ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,This game is so broken i cant even uninstall it...
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"A great PVE with friends. Do not go to a giant server; server freezes and rollbacks are increasingly common with more people. Luck has a moderate factor on gameplay. My very first spawn was right by raptors, but then another spawn was near nothing but herbivores. Team play is best, though single player is still fun (and more challenging). For the full experience, go in blind. If you want a headstart, then read up on a guide because you will be given very little tips and no tutorial. Plus there's dinosaur taming.

ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Ok so this game is seriously on of those games that will have you either addicted or rage quitting almost immediately. I have almost 1200 hours on steam, and just over 2k on xbox and have been playing since before the turned the old servers into legacy servers. This game can be brutally hard and official is almost not worth playing unless you can get into a mega tribe because raising dinos take at least like 2 days for creatures in the argy, bear or wolf range, and can take 2 weeks for end game tames like gigas. It is almost only worth playing on unofficial servers, especially modded ones, because they actually care about keeping their players and are likely to help fix bugs when, NOT IF, but when they happen. This game is FULL of bugs, and likely isn't worth paying full price for. When I first bought it, it was like 20usd. At that price, I think it's worth paying. But please don't pay full price for this game. There are problems that existed when I started playing that are still a problem. They gave this game it's full release price at what i would consider a beta stage, and I'm not sure it has actually been fixed enough to be considered a full game yet. I haven't played in a minute, but just redownloaded to play with friends who are about to get it on pc, so they might've fixed things in the most recent update that I dont know about"

I love dinosaurs. I love taming them; I love (non-sexually) riding them; I love to create armies of them.

The issue is: Ark is the only one who provides this experience and they provide it poorly. The game is awfully made with terrible features, yet they seek to steal our money by releasing another game.

When the game is ten bucks, get it. It is fun. But it is still awful. The bugs. The crashes. The godforsaken tethering. Sounds disappear and return without warning. This game is a man-made disaster.

Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,slimymmmcutem   zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz bouncy bad tar slimes
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"dude, very cool"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,I have enjoyed playing this game very much although the game gets boring after a little while. Eventually the constant basic tasks of collecting slimes and running over a map to find items gets tiring. I'm gonna have to give this game a No from me since it becomes boring and tiring after a little bit but a good game for a concept around slimes!
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,this game so much cute and relaxing
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,need slime girl with big booba
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"10/10 the Slimes are adorable, that is until they get massacred by Tar Slimes"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"there's a incinerator plot for a reason, and it is not to feed the fire slimes."
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,really cute game and with reasent updates a lot of new cute features to use and places to explore!!
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,slime

Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,best game of 2017
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"It's a fun game for the first several hours then it's gets boring and tedious. It's worth how much I bought it for (3 usd) but I wouldn't buy this for anything more. This feels like an EA game that still needs a year or two more dev time. Really cute slimes though. Love the Tubby + Phosphorous combination.

My issues:

1. No player customization

2. Tedious and clunky. You do everything with this one tool and most of the time, this are close together so you end up interacting with everything. In conjunction with the limited inventory slots, it gets annoying as hell.

3. NPCs and the story is basically non-existent. You get some letters from them (Read: walls of text) and they give you quests through terminals but that's it. Mochi was my best experience with NPCs and even then it was meh.

4. Odd interaction with slimes and food. Largos will not eat food that they can't reach so food will be left uneaten around corners and edges of corrals. If you use small slimes, the autofeeder can't feed them all because it will only spit out six at a time (A fully upgraded corral can easily fit 30 slimes). The only thing you can control is how often it spits and even then previously fed slimes will still eat so some will still starve. I struggled with this for hours until I just gave up and let food rot on the floor.

5. World is fairly big but feels barren. No point in exploring and doing that is kinda uninteresting anyways. There are treasures scattered around but even if you find one, you can't even open it unless you have what I assume is a late game upgrade (I've unlocked all biomes and still only have the first tier of chest unlocker). New biomes are only there for you to get the slimes that live there and the food they like. New biomes don't introduce any new mechanics either.

6. Limits limits limits. You can only carry 4 item types at a time with only 20 each (can be upgraded to 50 and maybe more later), you can only build on these specific plots with this specific shape only, you can only put gadgets on these specific spots, etc etc.

Overall: Slimes are cute but this game is more tedious and annoying rather than fun."
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"I saw that this game was on sale for only $5.99 and was like ""why not?"". Little did I know, it would be one of my new favorite games. I can't stop playing. This game is packed with a ton of super fun content. It's worth $19.99 and is a steal for any less."
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,ruin an ecosystem with nothing but a vacuum
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,POO EYES 🥶💪💪💪
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,Great and fun game. It would have been nice if there was a multiplayer option.
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"Very good game fun fun. I love when the slimey children go blee gah goop gah plomp pleenk, very calming too putting them all in cages and harvesting their... cool and funny. I especially like the beeg slimes when they go BLAAHGAH BLOOOONKK."
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,hdfedrfdrfyghaedr
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,My go-to game when I need cheering up or I'm really stressed out. I will continue to pay for extra content for this game. It's just some kind of perfection.
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,Nice :)
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"**I know it says I've played for 8 minutes but I played it on xbox before this**
Yeah this game good"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"good game but later on is just selling plorts for the weird club thingy
"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"I bought this game for the second time on PC after putting in nearly 200 hours on Xbox. It's a fantastic management game, well-paced, great art, and it has an interesting story that can be completely ignored if your'e the type to steamroll your way through these games. If you're not, there's a good bit of environmental storytelling going on along side the obviously story-driven bits. Would definitely recommend."
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"Fun cute game, definitely worth the money"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"amazing, great, fantastic, never been done before, extraordinary"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"A game like Stardew Valley and Terraria except you don't have to look up 50000 wiki articles on how to craft things and how to talk to people. The grind is smooth and easy, I don't feel it at all. Very chill, very casual. Very nice. Get in on a sale and you won't be disappointed :-)"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,Honestly is a very enjoyable singleplayer game where you can take it at your own special pace. If you need a game where you can mindlessly and happily farm and create cute mixtures of slimes
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,chickens :)
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,i love the game so much
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"Such a good relaxing game and its super fun, plus you dont need a super good computer to run this game decently."
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"I want to hug the slimes in this game
even the rock ones"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,Slime
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"very cute, very much playability
much appreciate"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,Slim
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"This game is genuinely one of the best games that I have ever played ever. It's genuinely so fun and satisfying to collect various slimes and take care of them, hangout with them, make coops and do all these fun mini games. It's one of the only games that has ever given me this much happiness and genuine smiles for once, and that's coming from someone who never liked playing singleplayer games!! I keep on playing this game for hours at a time, without noticing how much time passed. It's calming, amazing and I can just watch slimes jump around or play with each other for hours at a time and be at peace.

Seriously, this game is fantastic. I originally wanted to get this game as a joke, because people kept saying it's like a therapy, and I have to say it's way more than that. I'm really happy to hear that it's getting a sequel, this game is just fantastic. I seriously recommend getting this game whenever you can, it's such a worth while purchase!"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,cute
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,Super chill game where you build a pretty ranch with the happiest slimes ever.
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,woo!
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"This game is fun to play and keeps my happiness up

"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,very fun game. short story and very enjoyable.
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,Too much cute stuff
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"A fun filled, adorable game that is 100% worth playing!"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"I loved how it's a free range game and the slimes are very cute I really do recommend this game to other player's, and also the gameplay is awsome!"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,Farm+simulation=BEST
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,very fun
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"I highly recommend this game for those that are into a grinding experience similar to clicker games. This game is the perfect setting, where it isn't too difficult but it also isn't easy. It's perfectly in the middle of the spectrum. I played this game a total of 17 hours split between the PS4 and PC. It's one of the first games in a long time that has kept my interest for the pure grinding factor. I was able to work at my own pace, and there's so much that you can do as you unlock more in the game day by day. Each biome of the map is thrilling to travel through, and discover the slimes you haven't managed to get. I even loved watching as my ranch slowly upgraded through time to see the beautiful detail. Achievements are also incredibly fun and easy to get if you're into that.

A tip is that I recommend if you're considering getting this game. For sure get Slime Rancher through PC, and not console version (Unless you personally don't mind lag). Due to the old-ish consoles lacking the strength to handle Slime Rancher, as playing on the PS4. I would lag intensely on my ranch with barely any slimes, and it was difficult to garden crops. It also would lag so much in certain sections of the map that if you were to use your jet back, there's a chance you could die from lag if you didn't stop and let the game readjust to the new foreground. It was still playable. It just became a bit annoying over time, especially if there's a lot happening on your screen. PC has worked phenomenally. I haven't experienced any issues, besides a random glitch in my ranch that caused me to fall through the ground and I died. Besides that, it runs smoothly."
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,GOOD
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,POG
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,this game is so charming except for the part when you forcefeed a big slime to death
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,slavery was never this fun
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,This is the only grindy game I ever beaten without cheats.
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"Doom Eternal, but with slimes."
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,slime :D
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,slime :)
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"amazing game, enslave the slimes for profit then feel bad and allow them to have an workers revoultion, get overthrown and they put in a new communist leader and the slimes live a good life as they now own the means of production and part of the land"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,capitalism
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"this game... i have only positives to say, i love this game with my whole heart and its one of my favorite games. from the cute designs of the slimes to the beautiful, bright and vibrant areas and world map- this game is sooo visually pleasing as well as addicting to play. plus the game is so fun! its awesome to find new types of slimes and areas, and its super duper satisfying to shoot the plorts into the plort market and watch your money go up. i have 30 hours in one playthrough and its so cool to see your ranch grow. after so much time and effort put into it, it really pays off. slime rancher is such an adorably fun game to play, i cant praise it enough. it is absolutely worth the money if you like these types of games and id say its a must buy if you are someone who likes similar games. please give slime rancher a try!"

I was playing this game 4 years before(i think) and i loved it when i played it, then it showed up on my steam and i directly bought it to play again. It's fun to play, It's delightful to watch the slimes, travel from island to island etc. So much type of the slimes and Puddle slimes is the cutest thing i've ever seen. O////O"

Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,really makes you FEEL like you got reincarnated as a slime rancher
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"a very fun and engaging game with an adorable style and even more adorable characters! unfortunately, the way motion works triggers my motion sickness, and i can't play for long periods of time without getting a headache... if you don't have to deal with that, though, i definitely recommend it as a fun, relaxing game."
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"just amazing, would love to have a multiplayer (maybe even with just 2 players) where you can have the ranch together. Also different map choices would be great when starting a new game :D"
Slime Rancher,Adventure,433340,"If there was a VR version of this game i would play that sob a million times, i know my hours say 12.9 but i mostly played it offline i have like 100+ some odd hours the game was a fucking blast i dunno about any of you guys BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE A VR VERSION! so we can have even more fun!

Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Better than among us
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"""The game is titled 'Don't Starve' and the objective is to, not starve. So yes; I would call that good game design.""
—Shigeru Miyamoto"
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,starved :)
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"sometimes games just click with people. i couldn't really tell you why i love this game so much, but the way it FEELS to play- i have died hundreds of times after 20+ hour games just to sigh and start again. I've done almost everything there is to do and it still gives me a sense of atmosphere and calm that only a game like this could do. Bravo."
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Much easier than it's multiplayer counterpart. Better for playing solo.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"Fun little game, but it's a bit too much grind for my taste and it's not clear what to do and where to go.

I like games from this dev and have played almost all of their releases.

Worth for people who like survival games. It's a steal for how much it costs right now on sale (2 euros)."
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,spooky
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,good.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,it is very hard but after you learn what to do it slowly gets easy
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,after Klei started to work with Tencent this game should not me in indie category. But the game is still good
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,It's a funny twist on modern neoclassical grim dark humour.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,There is so much more to this game than meets the eye. It's kind of like a more high-stakes version of Animal Crossing or a more entertaining version of Minecraft.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,even if the captain of the titanic had full 24 hour notice of where the iceberg was and slammed into it intentionally he would have done a better job than the devs of this game. 10/10 would recommend
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Very good rogue-like survival game.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Great game. Much fun to be had. Good luck surviving.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"Essentiallt, Tim Burton's Minecraft with a bit of story. If you're into the gothic aesthitic and dark humor, highly recomend"
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"This is hands down my favourite game. I love all the different expansion packs, and it's very affordable."
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Although this game is years old I have only been able to play it on Steam recently. I have played it on my Switch numerous times and always enjoyed the game. I was looking to get Oxygen Not Included on here but when I saw the bundle with DS and DST I thought it was worth getting that instead of just ONI. There are some differences between DS and DST which I look forward to finding more of as I further my progress in each game.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,what da dog doin
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"Don't Starve is one of those challenging games that grab your attention and make you not want to stop playing even though it's hard.
Walkthrough a gigantic map, collect resources, die, learn, find out how to survive longer, die again, get better, improve your survival skills, eventually die and let the cycle repeat itself. It's not just the extremely charismatic, well-made, and unique art, or the wonderfully well-designed and creative world that gives this game a unique touch, a special place in any player's library. The mechanics and survival challenges are very well done, placed in such a way that each discovery makes you even more willing to try to survive (it's true that sometimes you get pretty lost not knowing what to do, but it's part of the experience). Don't Starve is a difficult game that will punish you at any opportunity and will encourage you to improve as a player in order to escape adversity and survive for more days.
For those more hardcore gamers who are tired of surviving for long days, the adventure mode reserves a really big challenge that will test the player's skill to the max.
The map options and their features leave to the player's liking whether you want a more intense or milder challenge, adapt the map to your style and stay immersed in the game because it is amazing!"
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I do. Initially bought it because I was attracted to the art style, but the game itself is challenging and fun. the mods are fun, and I also enjoy Hamlet a lot."
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,if you ever wanna forget your real life stress you can play this and the stress of trying not to die will keep you occupied
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"yes.
"
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"i absolutely love this game i love it so much the i have already recommended it to all my friends. i think its such a wonderful game it takes a lot of practice to get right and the fun thing is you wont get board easily, because as you get further in the game it just seems to get more interesting, i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys adventure style games. The artistry is beautiful you don't see this style of game very often so do yourself a favour and get it you won't be disappointed."
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"its a fun and fast game, you have to be on your toes not to starve and then move up to DS together. I really like this game,"
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,it is fun
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"This game is good, my only complaint is I can't convince my girlfriend to play it with me because it's spooky"
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,great game!

+ A lot of ugradable skills and weapons
+ Parkour is great and fun
+ Puzzles are challenging
+ Open world with many things to explore and wander around
+ Great graphics and well optimized
+ Epic music that tells you sh*t's about to get down

[h1] Extra pros : [/h1]
+ Very fun fast-crafting mechanic for stealth and loud
+ A lot more variety of weapons to use

[h1] Cons : [/h1]
- I've had some glitches here and there but it's not that bad
- Sometimes the assets doesn't load. (objectives, guards, etc.)

[b] Overall it's an amazing game with all the pros from its predecessor and some glitches.
Best adventure game i've played. [/b]
[h1] 10/10. [/h1]"

Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"I love this game so much.
So many improvements from the last game, and many fun activities and quests added."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"The Rise of the Tomb Raider serves as the sequel to the 2013 Tomb Raider remake, following events of Lara Croft's first expedition to Yamatai. While the second game does not necessarily need the first to understand the events and story that unfold, having played the first game provides a better understanding of Lara's character development and some references brought up from the first game from time to time.

The most appealing aspects and strong points of Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider series remake is its cinematic graphics, the details on Lara Croft's design (with this game displaying an even better definition than the first game), and the breathtaking landscapes creating the world in Lara's journeys. New features are also introduced to make the gameplay more interesting and interactive when solving challenges and surviving brutal terrains in accomplishing optional objectives or progressing with the story. The story itself is typical for a thrilling escapade to hidden worlds waiting to be discovered, one fit for a Lara Croft adventure.

The Rise of the Tomb Raider also includes the ""Croft Manor: Blood Ties"", which is a great addition to the game that gives more depth to Lara, her family history, and her background. It gives a sense of people from Lara's past you never knew, some of who you never even see, but from whom you can feel emotion in relaying experiences, thoughts, and events, to create a history all leading to Lara's destiny.

Rise of the Tomb Raider sees another fun and challenging adventure into a new unknown world, and becomes the defining moment where Lara fully embraces her family name and forges her own legacy as a Croft."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,I mix up all these Tomb Raider games in my head man. But I recommend them on sale. The third one has awesome graphics. I think this is the first or second one?
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"-Boss, should we put Relics, Documents, Murals, Monoliths, Coin Caches, Survival Caches, Strongboxes, Archivist Maps, Cards, Explorer Satchels, Challenges, Codices or Crypt Treasures as collectables?

-Yes, yes, YES, WUAHAHAHA EVRYON LAIKKS COLECTABL :D

-How many?

-Yes :D WUAHAHA.

Other than this, an amazing game that's worth your money."

Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,how the f her face survive all the play through without any scratch ? ( ͠❛ ͜ʖ͠❛ )
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"This release keeps to the things which made Tomb Raider enjoyable from the first PS1 days. All Tomb Raider fans will find this game very enjoyable. And, to the first time experience gamers checking out TR, you will find this release integrages a rich history of Tomb Raider mechanics and story.

I am a veteran TR fan and gamer. I find myself laughing and having fun because it makes me remember all the other TR games."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,This game has everything that made the first tomb raider work so well - Lara’s booty. I could stare for hours on end at times and really got carried away. It’s incredible that in a game with huge explosions and big action scene all the eyes are drawn to is Lara’s fat dump truck. 9/10. I would give it the perfect 10/10 if she didn’t need to wear so much in cold weather.
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"I loved Lara's face in TR 2013 and her face in Rise looks so much prettier. I'm excited to pick up Shadow once it's on sale but I wish they had at least used the same model from Rise. The reboot seems pointless if they keep changing her face and making her look like a completely different person.

In general, the story is pretty much predictable but still fun to follow, combat feels good (many cool ways to take down enemies), most of the puzzles are very compelling to solve, collectibles like documents, relics, murals, and monoliths contain revealing information that help you understand the story better, graphics are immensely beautiful (except in Geothermal Valley), and the ending song is really good. It fits the game perfectly. [b]10/10[/b] Lara's booty can be distracting sometimes."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"well i have already played all of tomb raider games (tomb raider - rise of the tomb raider - shadow of the tomb raider) and i admit this one is the best one, why? a very big step to forward from the first one, i mean graphic is amazing, gameplay got really improved and most cut scenes are real and motion captured well + a better story compare to the first one. in my opinion rise of the tomb raider is an epic experience."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,I devoted all of my potato PC just for the hair physics just for it to crash on me. I would do it again 10/10
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"Laraa....,She is Pretty heheheh"
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,I'm both happy and sad that this game coincided with the years I was completely obsessed with The Witcher 3. I wish someone had told me how magnificent it is. It's so good. Think of a better Uncharted mixed with Assassin's Creed older versions. I am so happy to have got everything at such a low price but I am so sad I have missed it when it first came out. Outstanding game. Absolutely recommended.
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,Rise of the Tomb Raider is an excellent game that I would strongly recommend to anyone looking for a good action adventure experience.

Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"Cant stop falling in love with this game. Completed it just now, 100% completion, and before i finished it yet, i already knew im gonna play it again. Trying harder difficulty levels. The story is absolutely wonderful, the gameplay is wonderful as well. So much to do, takes a lotta searching to really complete whole game but the satisfaction after you found everything is incredible. Combats are enjoyable, puzzles... those are really fantastic. And then once you finished the game, you can still enjoy it, making each map as a challenge in a special mode for this, compete with friends and all the players, who gets more points and so on. Highly recommended by me :)"

Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"The game itself is magical. Spacious views of snowy valleys, hot Syrian desert dunes and a beautiful forgotten city make the game worth it's money and reputation. I 100% recommend the game, especially to the new players who aren't that familliar with the genre.
Absolutley looking foward to any new games of that kind aswell."

Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"I'm down bad








I may or may not be joking but this game makes a really good follow up to the previous 2013 game. I love how detailed the environments look and they very realistic. The overall detail is also improved as Lara looks more realistic than the previous game. The overall story isn't as good as the previous game but I still think its very good. The game mechanics have also improved and became more fun. There is also a DLC blood ties that adds a lot more lore into the Tomb Raider canon which I find is a nice touch and is super chill to play as it is taking a break from all the combat in the main story."

Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"Tomb raider 2013 : Best in the the trilogy in terms of story. The optional tombs aren't great.

Rise of The Tomb Raider : Best in the trilogy in terms of gameplay mechanics, character design and sound. Story is very linear(plain) and has no depth at all. Optional tombs are quite great.

Shadow of The Tomb Raider: Best in the trilogy in terms of environmental design. Man Peruvian rain forest is just so damn beautiful! I must have taken thousands of screenshots. In this game Lara is depicted as an overconfident, ruthless and cold blooded butcher. She will obliterate whoever gets in her path. I was blown away by her sheer badassery. Jonah has some great in depth character buildup here. My personal favourite in the trilogy.

[IF YOU PLAN ON GETTING THIS ONE GET THE WHOLE TRILOGY, YOU WON'T REGRET IT I PROMISE]"
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,Great game Tomb Raider has been my favorite for a long time now
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"If you like the 2013 Tomb Raider then you will probably like this.

8/10 great story, but too much side stuff."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"To divide it into three , according to the course of the game
Beginning of the game was fine, The action drops a little in the middle, but it regains the momentum towards the end.
Comparing to other tr game that released at 2013, it includes some new mechanics and gameplay but mostly the same.
About storyline i would give it a seven out of ten, It has a somewhat intriguing story.
Graphics and overlays are all good. For replayability ; yeah why not.
And you know...  Lara croft."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"the more i play this game the more i hate it, it lost 100% of its identity and chose to become a cheap Uncharted Knockoff... this is just sad. you always make jumps (even if u dont run..), combat system is now just bad uncharted copy paste, lara now takes cover and shoot an AK and bow.... o...k.... this game has nothing to do with tomb raider.... except the name"
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"I loved the first 30 mins of the game. have a bad graphics card, so had to refund. will buy after I get upgrades!
"
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"I have finished the rise of the tomb raider base game, along with a dlc called blood ties. I am going to preface this review by saying i paid something like $6 for everything. This game is incredible, and it is worth everybody's time. Before this game, i had no prior tomb raider experience or knowledge. By the end of the campaign, i am heavily invested in the characters the game presents. The campaign was excellent, and kept me invested in every new plot development. After the main campaign had concluded, blood ties served as a fantastic 2 hour experience to find out Lara's past, as well as to uncover some unsolved mysteries. In short, this game is worth $40, let alone 6 bucks. I heavily recommend everyone try it."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"Garbage. The plot is predictable, the movement feels floaty on the floor and overly magnetic on the walls, the gunplay is extremely unsatisfying. It also suffers from a severe case of 'LET ME DO SOMETHING IN YOUR GAAAAAAAAME' as it has you sitting through cutscenes and walking segments, especially when the climbing sections are essentially corridors on walls featuring trashy attempts at tension scares instead of actual video games. Lara's voice actor is noticeably shoddy too with some of the driest, uninteresting voice acting I've heard in a game of budget. There is nothing outstanding or noteworthy about this game and it clearly lacks any real vision or defining strong point."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"ok so
fun combat.
good open (kinda) world.
good stealth.
beautiful map design.
nice puzzles.
satisfying finishers.
good and enjoyable story.
amazing work on the characters talking, like the lips are so real and all.

ok so now the bad
AI kinda dumb.
you get cool gadgets but some are at the end of the game where you don't use them a lot.
sometimes the game like stops and can crash (crashed only 1 time but the stop happened a lot, maybe its just me)

overall good game to spend like 30 or so hours."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"Hey Lara, let's flip a coin. Heads you're mine, tails I'm yours.

Please marry me. xoxo.

You look cold. I don't mind if you want to use me as a blanket. <3"
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"I really enjoyed playing Rise of the Tomb Raider because it took the game a step further with more to explore, a new story called Blood Ties where you explore Croft Manor, and an endurance survival mode. This game keeps you busy by playing endurance to see how long you can survive the night and day or completing challenges to earn cards to use in expeditions. I rate this game a 10/10 for the story rich campaign and the amount of content that keeps you busy and coming back to play it again after completing the campaign."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,good af
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,Good story line.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Everything about it is great. Only downside to this game is that there is no Shun Akiyama.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Unironically one of the best games i've played so far
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"Right, where do I start...

Yakuza: Like a Dragon (later in this review Yakuza 7) has been my introduction to the Yakuza franchise as a whole. Prior to this, all I knew about was the Bakamitai meme, which I also only knew as the Dame Da Ne song. I was a bit sceptical about getting into it at first, as I knew absolutely nothing about the game and franchise as a whole, and Brawlers weren't really my thing, but then I heard that this game features a different protagonist, and instead of a Brawler, plays as a turn based RPG. I had some money left over from Christmas, and I'm a big fan of the old Final Fantasy games, so I thought I might as well give it a try. Could always refund it if I didn't enjoy it. 

In Yakuza 7, you play as Ichiban Kasuga, a Yakuza grunt who goes to jail to cover for a higher-ranking member of the Arakawa family, which he belongs to. Thinking that this would make him climb the Yakuza ladder, and that his patriarch will honour and appreciate his cover, he comes back after 18 years of prison time to find out that everybody had abandoned him. Former police officer Koichi Adachi researched about the Tojo Clan and the Arakawa Family, attempts to convince Ichiban to come with him to Yokohama to stay safe, but Ichiban refuses. Ichiban finds his way back to his former patriarch and is then met with an unfortunate fate.

Oh boy, I was immediately hooked from the start. ""That's a lot of cutscenes for a game, it's like I'm watching a movie"" was my first thought. I liked story heavy games, but I felt a little overwhelmed on my first day, as out of the probably 5 or 6 hours that I was playing, 4 of them were just watching cutscenes. Now this might turn some people down, especially if they just want to enjoy the gameplay, but all the introductory scenes got me more invested in finding out about the presented characters and I didn't just want to stop playing until I found a point where I thought ""Okay, now the actual game finally begins.""

The vast majority of this game takes plays in the streets of Yokohama, more specifically, Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama's red light district. The world is incredibly detailed and you'll be pleasantly surprised to know that there's things hidden in every single corner. I really enjoy exploring in video games, trying to see if there's things hidden in places nobody would think of and-- to my surprise, they really thought of everything here. I try sneaking into a corner that I think might not even be intended to go to, and yet, there's something there for me to pick up. 

I personally went for the ""50% main story, 50% side story"" approach, which to me means - I'll do 2 or 3 side quests, of which there are plenty in Yakuza 7, and then I'll do a few story quests so that I can keep up with what is happening. And trust me, there's a lot of content to burn through. All of the sidequests are very well designed, and most of them got at least a little bit of a chuckle from me, so I'd like to think that they are quite humorous. Once done with the sidequests, I grabbed my imaginary bucket of popcorn and started getting immersed in the story. 

After I arrived in Yokohama, and the game properly begun for me, I thought to myself that this would be a silly little hero adventure. One of a redemption arc where Ichiban becomes the hero of a big and epic tale. Well, it's kinda like that, it starts off slow and adventurous, but the more the story goes on, Ichiban falls deeper into this crime drama rabbit hole. I will not spoil anything for the sake of letting you enjoy it by yourself, but I can say you're in for a treat. A big one. 

The gameplay itself is, as mentioned earlier, a turn based RPG. I hit you, then I wait, then you hit me, and then you wait. Yakuza 7 adds a nice little twist to that by adding small, simple QTEs to most of your abilities. Sometimes you might have to press a button repeatedly to give it more power, sometimes you might need to press the button at the proper time instead. Sometimes even both! It's a very, very simple thing but it keeps the combat entertaining, which is the main purpose. All attack animations look nice and polished too, some of the names and descriptions are silly and will put a weird look on your face when you first see it, but all skills feels nice to use. You might not have many skills when you first start the game, but the more you progress, the more and more skills will be added to your arsenal.

This game works in a job system, which you might be familiar with if you played some Final Fantasy games. While each character has their own primary main job, they can also switch to other jobs, which in this game are gender locked. Male characters can choose from a variety of different jobs, and female characters have their own jobs to choose from, too. Some of these jobs exist for both genders, although slightly altered, such as Host for males and Hostess for females. They essentially do the same thing, yet they slightly differ from one another.

Now, apart from the amazing story that this game has to offer, and the ability to throw ridiculous-looking skills at your enemies, there's also plenty of minigames that you can play in this game. Of course, there's Karaoke (also with Bakamitai!), Mahjong, Shogi and Dragon Kart (yes, like actual kart racing) just to name a few. Each of these felt well thought out and they're fun to do, and you can seriously get invested in them if you're dedicated enough. Sometimes I booted this game up just to play a little bit of Mahjong...

But there's probably a few negatives about this game, right? Yes there are, but in my personal opinion, these are just minor things that probably won't even bother you unless you think really hard about it. What I disliked during my playthrough is that there's just. so. many. random. encounters. I was told by a friend that this is common in the Yakuza games, and that you'll have to just deal with it, but god there's just so many. Happens a lot that you walk down one street and you get hit with 3 or 4 different encounters that really badly want to murder you. There is an item in this game that completely removes random encounters, but I feel like you'll get access to it way too late. By the time you have it, you're probably able to finish the game for good already. Another issue that I had in this game is that there was one dungeon that just felt way too long to complete. It wasn't even challenging or anything, you just entered a new floor and thought ""this is it"", only to be hit with a wave of disappointment as you realize this is just another floor with the same enemies as the last one. It was a slog to get through it, but luckily it's only a one time thing.

So, what can I say to finalize this review? I think that Yakuza 7 is an amazing game, with a well written and properly thought out story that is guaranteed to keep you glued to your screen, fun and entertaining combat to keep you playing, and a wide variety of different minigames that you grind out, or even just relax with if you feel like. Ichiban and his party makes it feel like you're part of the crew, that his achievements and goals are yours too, and that you too can overcome any obstacle if you just believe in yourself and don't give up. Ichiban Kasuga has been one of the most relateable characters I have ever met and he's found a place in my heart that I will protect. This game has also made me buy all the other main Yakuza games and I'm motivated to play through all of them, at the time of this review I am currently on Yakuza 4 Remastered. As I found out while playing, there are plenty of references to the older Yakuza games that will make you go ""Oooh, I know this"" when you see them, and they still don't feel out of place when you're new to it. I am very happy that this game introduced me to the series and I have no shame admitting that I cried when it was over."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"I held off on getting this game for a while, I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy the turn based combat instead of the traditional beat em up. I'm glad I bought this game and I wish I had sooner. This has become my favorite of the franchise and one of the best games I've ever played. The story is incredible and filled with brilliantly written and acted characters. 

The protagonist, Ichiban, has quite the boots to fill now that we're not playing as Kiryu anymore. Ichiban is an amazing protagonist and without question does Kiryu justice. The emotional range is wider, and the positive outlook on everything that Ichiban invigorates sets him apart from Kiryu. They're both masterpieces of character development, writing and acting. 

The gameplay is incredibly fun and addicting. Leveling up your character as well as the Job you have set at any given time. Jobs are essentially specializations that incorporate different roles like healing, magic/melee, or even tanking. There's tons of loot, materials for crafting gear, and an enormous variety of enemy designs. Since the game has taken this turn into JRPG territory it's allowed more traditional aspects of other RPGs. There's dungeons, tons of bosses and minibosses, an endgame activity that's very difficult, and more. There's well over 100 hours worth of content here and it all improves you and your party's abilities. 

My complaints are negligible, there's sometimes too many enemies on the streets. That's pretty much it, Yakuza Like A Dragon is near perfect and a must play for anyone who's played the previous games and for anyone who wants to jump for the first time into this universe. Playing the previous games aren't necessary."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"As a Yakuza game, its about what you expect. The game is at times a soap opera, then its grounded in reality and then its goes to some REALLY bizarre and absurd places, and thats just great. Ichiban is NOT Kiryu, we trade super manly ideal super strong dad for a gold hearted goofball badass idiot, and its kind of okay, hes way less of a power fantasy and more of a relatable character thats struggling to make it in life, which at times hits too close to home. As an rpg, its kinda clunky and not too deep, visually its very good. The narrative is what I enjoyed the most from this game, and its pretty good. 8/10, worth your time and money."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"[i]--This [b]will[/b] contain some big spoilers. Don't yell at me.--[/i]

The newest entry into the Yakuza franchise, and RGG's first foray into the jRPG genre -- and generally, what a blast this is. It's captivated me with every step and turn, and kept me hooked until the very end -- even with some of its questionable design decisions later in the main storyline.

The game starts out kind of slow, with you learning the ropes in a restrictive tutorial zone throughout Kamurocho. Luckily, this is not how the game stays, and Kamurocho is luckily only a bit of set dressing in this game. Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama, is where the real meat is at -- a delightfully large map (by RGG standards, being that it's four times the size of Kamurocho) with a lot to explore and take in. This is what the game really was designed around, and where the jRPG shenanigans really get into full swing.

Isezaki Ijincho is divided into districts -- each with their own taxi locations that you have to *discover* before you can use them to travel to those locations, making you actually explore and discover Isezaki Ijincho for yourself -- that all have their own ""threat levels."" These threat levels are the game's way of telling you how strong the enemies in an area are -- and thus, how much of a threat they are to you. I love this, I wish more jRPGs told me this info. It's fantastic, and makes the experience of roaming a lot easier, and grinding even easier.

The main story follows Kasuga and his ragtag group of friends throughout the bustling city of Yokohama, as they find themselves slowly wedged into a feud. Bleach Japan are a group that want to cleanse the city of its ""gray zones,"" by any means necessary -- including using Yakuza muscle. Their interactions with BJ, as well as their work for a soapland, eventually lead them to walk into a sprung trap; from there, they really devolve into their big feud, with many twists and turns abound. As always, these games will find a way to make you emotional, and this one might be the most effective at that yet.

As far as gameplay goes, RGG went for a simplistic, but delightful approach. You still roam about the city freely, like any Yakuza game, and the encounters still work similarly as the previous brawler entries -- but it's here where the big twist lies; Upon entering a battle, you are thrown into a very modern jRPG battle system: a simple menu divided into four halves, each for specific functions, your HP/MP counters, and a nice automatic battle system you can opt into and give light directions to. The four-button menu is neatly divided: Attack, Guard, Skills and Miscellaneous. The first three are fairly self-explanatory, and the latter brings you into a second menu for two more items, depending on whose turn it currently is: Items, and if you're Kasuga and have unlocked it, Poundmates. The poundmates are your summons, and include a wild variety from people you meet through sidequests and even a couple through the main story. They're awesome, and a great aid during battles.

Another core mechanic of the game is the Jobs system, which defines what skills, perks and weapons a character can use. Not all characters can have the same jobs, and most of them have in-game requirements to unlock; But rest assured, they're all great and with their own perks, and really allow you to build a good team for your preferred play style. Not to mention they're plenty wacky, with often goofy visuals and animations, to really ham up the silliness of the RPG battle system and its surrounding mechanics.

As I mentioned though, the game does have some critical flaws that have certainly gotten me a bit... [i]annoyed[/i] with the game -- namely how level scaling and difficulty curve intertwine. Up to chapter 9, so long as you do most of the provided content, you will have a breeze of a time, and no hitches. The boss of chapter 9 is where the issues start to arise, where I had to actually start grinding -- but available enemy groups gave little XP for the level I was at, and it was overall just a real slog to get my levels up. That's where a fair chunk of my playtime came from, as that took 32 hours across multiple days where I had the time to go grinding. Okay, so that done -- that was it, right? All good? Nah, it was a breeze up until Chapter 12 -- where it suddenly jumps the difficulty from your general level (Level 32-35 is what I've seen most at, at that stage), up to level 50, with two beefcake bosses that also dish out a friggin' BUTTLOAD of damage. At least this time they offer a battle arena with plenty of battles that dish out XP like scout cookies, and it made the grind a lot quicker! Only 12 hours, as opposed to 32, but that starts to show the issue -- levelling starts to require an inane amount of points, but the game is really stingy about handing that XP out unless you find very specific farming routines. This is where my fun started to fall apart, especially as I approached the final boss and was faced with the reality that I needed to grind again.

The biggest problem with this game, really is its climax. Any sense of satisfaction was taken away from me when I came to realise that the final boss has a conditional One-hit KO. One that favours targeting Kasuga, who, may I add, upon death, is an instant game over. This lead me to have to grind up my levels to a point where I can beat Mister Beefcake, Master of the OHKO, Tanker of All Damage, Owner of Almost All Resists, comfortably and stop his OHKO from actually being an OHKO. I don't know the statistics behind it, or what it's expecting, but it's a darn pain in the butt.

I really felt robbed of a fair chunk of my satisfaction, but even so, I recommend this game wholeheartedly. Just be ready to grind out a lot of stuff. Be ready to get annoyed at this game at spots, as it tells you ""you've not done enough yet!"" But even with all of those grievances, even with it being a slow burn at the start, this game is just a barrel of fun with an expertly written story. I didn't expect a lot of what had gone down in this story, and I'm glad I took my time to play it and enjoy it. Absolutely worth every cent, whether you buy it during a sale or at full price. Support RGG, show them we want more of this, because this was, and is an awesome experience. I'm sure I'll be replaying this with the Japanese VA soon."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"This game has saved my life.

I am 27 years old.

My ex wife and I have a daughter together and we adopted our son . They are both now 4 years old.

When we went through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. One day I got so angry at the spiral that was getting out of hand that I punched the cement in a moment of overflowing emotion. That caused me to break the fifth metacarpal in my right hand.... my working hand... my play hand... the hand I used to hold and carry my children to bed with. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to thrive.

After learning the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was on the verge of suicide. It should be noted that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man alive, with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of anger, nor have I ever been one to burst into tears, but I was at a low point that prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play one-handed while I recovered. Somehow I stumbled across this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a try.... I must admit that I didn't get through the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have only played a day or two. That said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope in life. I was able to let go of the pain and suffering that had been hanging over me. I was able to experience other people's joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes with this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand really hurt, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself, and I became the parent I needed to be at that moment, not the weak child I was.

Today I am very close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

I now have 3 children. My third son is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we stumbled into each other's lives unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year and are very happy together.

The moral of the story is that you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all the odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you,Hentai Mosaique Neko Waifus."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"I recommend it to:

-People who don't like JRPGs (vs Western RPGs) but want to find a JRPG they like.
-Similarly, people who are tired of the usual depiction of Japan in media. This game focusses more on the ""streets"" of Japan for lack of a better term, and the everyday people in them. The homeless, prostitutes, petty criminals, sleazy businessmen, etc...
-People who like Gintama, as the humour, setting and characters share many similar features, aesthetics and themes.
-Similarly, people who appreciate over the top and hammy combat as well as stories and situations (usually applies more to side content rather than the main story)
-People who are looking for a video game main character that isn't two googly eyes stuck on a potato. Ichiban is interesting, dynamic, likeable and in a few ways quite relatable.

Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"7/10. Enjoyable, but I liked previous Yakuza games a bit more.

Strengths: Larger world than previous Yakuza games.
  good batch of mini games.
  equipment enhancement system gives a reason to grind.

Weaknesses: Combat feels more goofy than epic. Boss fights just aren't as intense as the rest of the franchise. Boss fights just break down to repeatedly doing the same thing over and over which gets real old real fast. Longer isn't better.
  Main story tries to adapt to having a 'party' but that just isn't consistent through the story. Side stories down right ignore the party except during any sort of fight. 

If you are looking to scratch the Yakuza itch, buy this. If you want wacky adventures in Japan's underbelly, buy this. If you want to punch guys and feel epic doing it ... replay a different Yakuza game."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,I still don't know how to play Mahjong.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Essence of the Orbital Laser+ I cried at the ending.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"While I still recommend Yakuza:Like a Dragon and it may interest some newcomers from the RPG crowd, I have to say that as a fan of the series, I feel underwhelmed. The story between mid-chapters to the finale stretch a lot. Too many obvious plot points being elaborated over, and over and over.  Major battles don't feel as epic as any of the past game because it is restricted by the battle system.

However, the game is still fun and its first chapters will manage to pull you in with its charms. The battle system is alright but IMO it needs to be less traditional and more inventive, to capture more of what we expect of the Yakuza series when it comes to epic and emotional battles.

On the technical side, the game runs very well on my PC and during my 100+ hours I experienced only one crash. I hope that SEGA continues this quality of publishing on their future PC ports."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,SO MUCH FUN!! One of the best games I have played in recent times. 10/10 would recommend
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"Overall, I really enjoyed this game, it was my entry point into the Yakuza series. It's got lots of heart and humour.

 The turn-based battle system is entertaining  at the onset but can get a bit tedious, mainly due to big spikes in difficulty in the last 3/4 into the game that force you through dungeons to level up.  That said, the endearing cast (well voiced) and interesting (albeit somewhat predictable) story-line kept me going. The cities in the game are lovingly crafted and there are plenty of side quests and mini games to indulge in if that's your kind of thing. 

The game was also really polished (I didn't encounter any bugs) and it ran over 60 fps at 4K (RTX 3080) with no issues whatsoever.  Refreshing in these days of buggy, poorly optimised games.

Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,i wanna fuck the shit out of this game
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Local schizophrenic man goes on a mission to become a better person.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"The game is really slow to start off, so those of you used to the older Yakuza games might get turned off initially. I certainly wasn't sold on Y7 until past mid point. The changes to turn based combat did leave me a bit miffed, but I got over it. 

The story is certainly the strongest of the serie, after Y0 imo, but it does take a while to get the train going. Past villains often had one scene with not much characterization, but the great thing about Y7 is that everyone gets well developed, so there's a lot less plot holes compared to past games.

Ichiban can be a bit cringe at time with his power of friendship talks, but he does have a lot of charm to him nonetheless."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"Definitely one of the best stories i have encountered in a JRPG.
Highly recommend for anyone to play this awesome game."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"[h2][b]Score: 8.5/10[/b][/h2]

You play as Ichiban Kasuga. A naive young yakuza member who ends up in politics of his yakuza family and then later the entire country of Japan’s government. The story is incredibly well written and directed, and I was hooked from beginning to end, at least the story and characters. I love the characters here as they have tons of heart, soul, and personality that make you want to see them through to the end of their journey. The first three chapters of the game are pretty much story and character building. In fact, I didn’t really get to do anything outside of watching cut scenes for the first three hours of the game. I just ran to spots that triggered them and I watched this complex web of characters build their story up, and I wasn’t upset as I was glued to my screen the whole time.

This is the first time I’ve finished a Yakuza game and a rare completion of a JRPG. Usually, JRPGs have great stories and characters, but something within the game keeps me from finishing it. Be it unfair and insane difficulty, too much grinding or late-game issues pop up like needing to quest for something very specific and it makes the progression grind to a halt. Like a Dragon is the first in the series to play like a JRPG and not an action game. The story is fantastic and the characters are well written and memorable, but that’s probably the strongest thing going for the game, and it’s the reason why I slumped through the late game issues to see it through to the end.

Once you get past a certain point in the story, honestly I can’t say anything as every little detail could be a major spoiler, you finally get let loose in the world. However, with this being a JRPG let’s talk about combat first. The game is played in a turned-based style, but characters move around on their own in the arenas. Depending on your job you have various skills that can cause major damage, and this is super important and the core of the entire game. While base attacks are fine early on in the game, they don’t do much later on and you start relying on skills that all use MP whether they’re physical or magic-based. Each attack has a type such as magic, slashing, piercing (guns), bashing, or blunt (physical) attacks. Some attacks might have elemental attributes attached to them, but you really must balance your team. You need characters that can heal, do large AoE damage, and lots of damage to single enemies. It’s important you have a class that can do one of each of those things as it’s key to winning battles.

Early on in the game, the difficulty feels perfect. There were some challenges, I had to use strategy, and really focus on ranking up my character’s jobs and learn enemy weaknesses. This is also a key point in the battle system. Like a Dragon mocks or makes fun of other games like Pokemon. Early on you come across someone similar to Professor Oak and the entire scene plays out like the beginning of every Pokemon game. It’s pretty funny. The point of this is you acquire a bestiary of each enemy type and when you fight in battle and discover a weakness it will appear over the character when you select that attack. This is vital to winning boss fights and harder battles late game or just in general.

Ranking up your job is more important than leveling up your character honestly. This determines your max health, how powerful your attacks are, and learning new attacks. You get more powerful attacks as you rank up, but the downside is once you change a job you start from the bottom on that job. So you have to grind that job to level it up, and late-game this is incredibly tedious, but more on the late-game problems later. There are thankfully no random battles, but enemies walk around outside that can be avoided. When you fight enemies the environment is also important as smaller areas are great for attacks that do AoE damage and it allows you to wipe out enemies faster in bigger groups. 

Outside of combat, there are a ton of mini-games like in every Yakuza game. Karaoke, classic Sega arcade games in Club Sega, crane games, driving ranges, go-karts, and many others. They’re fun at first, but there’s not really any reason to do these mini-games outside of acquiring items. Items are also an important part to combat as the most powerful armor and weapons are almost unobtainable until you can start raking in serious cash at the Battle Arena in chapter 12 and fighting the more powerful enemies late game. You can also upgrade Ichiban’s weapons (only his weapons can be upgraded) and well as craft new items, but honestly, this is only needed if you can’t afford to buy them. There are no unique weapons or armor that can be crafted exclusively, at least that I noticed, and once I started raking in serious cash in the millions I just bought everything and crafting became pointless towards the end of the game.

As you progress through the first eleven chapters hopping around taxis to fast travel to spots, unraveling the story, ranking up your jobs, leveling characters, acquiring new armor and weapons and items, and all this sounds like a normal JRPG affair, but then chapter twelve comes and knocks you on your ass. This is when most people will probably quit the game as it turns into a completely different beast and the way you play must change. This is the worst part about the game, and I don’t see how this was necessary. The game had a perfect flow and difficulty level leading up to this chapter. The first sign hits you when you must acquire 3 million Yen for a specific reason in the story. By now you probably have a couple hundred thousand yen at the most. How am I going to get this much money as street thugs don’t really payout and I can only sell so much? Well, the first stupid idea was that there are specific things you need to do to get this money and they don’t tell you. First, you have a watch in your inventory that’s worth one million yen. You need to sell that and then there is a specific Hero Quest you must complete that gives you two million yen. You need to take ten photos of a statue hidden throughout the city. What a serious pain in the ass. I knew right here that the game was going to be a chore from here on out. Then to make matters worse, the last statue is hidden behind insanely difficult enemies out of nowhere. They were many 8 levels above me, but that wasn’t a problem before. I had to grind for a couple of hours just to beat them to take that photo. Such nonsense!

It just gets worse from here. Chapter seven had you complete one of two long dungeons in the game. It was challenging, but not impossible. This dungeon is the only way to grind up until now. However, once you get to a new small city you unlock the battle arena, and this is your main way to level grind by climbing floors and beating waves of enemies. You will be here for probably 6-8 hours minimum. At this point in chapter twelve, you come across a boss fight that cranks the difficulty up to nearly unfair and impossible. I had to grind 15 levels just to get a fair advantage. This boss just absorbs so much damage and throwing all my powerful attacks at him still kicked my ass. I died and retried nearly a dozen times before I almost gave up. I’d grind five or six levels and try again until I could finally do it.

The game at least has amazing voice acting (in Japanese of course), and the graphics are pretty good technically, but pretty boring on an artistic level. These are hyper-realistic graphics and the only artistic flair is the enemy designs. I enjoyed the music as well, but in the end, the last few chapters will test your patience. The mini-games are fun, the sub-stories are boring and repetitive, and the post-chapter twelve grinding is an absolute chore and really hurts the game. However, if you can prevail, get through the grinding, and learn the strategy of balancing your parties jobs you will get through an incredible and memorable story with great characters."

And the best part is, each element I described above (there's definitely more to this, but these are the ones that stood out for me) is presented in the most Yakuza way possible. That is, weird, surreal, and exaggerated.

I love it."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"I was reading through the reviews and I was thinking that it was almost impossible for a JRPG to have such awesome reviews.
I was wrong. This game is awesome.

Pros:
Fun minigames
Hours upon hours of side quests
Goofy characters and fight scenes
Persona-esque gameplay (The good side ) ; bonds, party/dinner chat, party based combat 
Jobs make for interesting combinations
Interesting storyline
Tons of items and gears

Cons:
Overly grindy means that its time consuming and may not suit everyone
Pricey DLCs (got everything on a sale so i dont mind)
Relationships/Max bonds do not confer direct advantage (should have added stat bonus to MC instead)
Repetitive fighting style and combat dialogue makes for boring grind
Lack of select all functions in Management mini games, means you have to select employees one by one and raise motivation
Party characters are somewhat aloof. Romance and tight bonds do not yield special dialogues or activities. 


In all, its a fun game that should be bought if its on discount and you have a thing for persona style games. Its grindy nature means that you are most likely not going play this game a second time through; but its achievements are set in such a way that you will want to go for a platinum playthrough. On a side note, If we could do social activities with our party members/romance targets, it would greatly increase its already awesome gameplay.

Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Half-Life Alyx easily makes up for the 15+ years of waiting for Half-Life 3. I can only hope HL3 is this good. I highly recommend playing this on the Valve Index, as it is truly worth the price.

Graphics:
-Insane. I played on ultra fidelity at high refresh rate since my PC can handle it. There is a substantial difference between good graphics on a monitor VS in VR. I'm not quite sure how they accomplished it, as most areas look insanely real. Lighting with a flashlight or laser acts in the way my brain would expect it to, and the amount of detail on simple things such as a notification posted on a wall made me want to constantly stop and look around the environment. The environments alone make this game worth playing, and are a technological marvel.

Combat:
-Unlike anything I've ever played. Using iron sights on weapons requires you to use one eye, just as you would in real life. Manually having to eject a handgun magazine, grab a new one from your backpack, slam it into the gun, then chamber a round is incredibly fun and satisfying. Reloading in itself is a task that requires mastering, and never gets old. This creates a lot of tense moments of fun, such as being grabbed by a barnacle, only to realize you had two bullets left in the magazine and now need to panic reload. I dropped multiple magazines of ammo trying to panic reload in combat, and this only adds to the realism and tension. The shotgun is similar; having to manually chamber shells, then slam the bolt to load. Never gets old. Also, throwing grenades feels extremely intuitive and natural (IF USING THE VALVE INDEX), and objects throw in the way I'd expect them to. If you have a larger play space, you can physically move around to duck behind cover,  walk through doors with your gun ready, shoot around corners, dodge projectiles, etc.

Puzzles:
-Clever use of interaction and physics makes puzzles really interesting and fun in a way that you haven't encountered in other games. Defusing bombs for example is essentially a minigame of trying to carefully thread a needle through small rings without touching them, while being on a timer. Your success is purely based upon your dexterity, and if you fail it all blows up in your face (literally).

Audio:
-I played using the Valve Index, which has the built-in headphones that float near your ears. These provided the most realistic environmental sound I've ever experienced in a game. I'm not sure how Valve even accomplished this. There is excellent kick and bass to guns and things in the environment. At one point I took my VR headset off because I thought an actual bee was in my apartment, but it was the game.

Story:
-I don't want to spoil anything, but the story was FAR better than I thought it would be, and adds A LOT of intriguing questions to the series. There are some extremely key moments in the game that make you stop and be like O_O


TLDR:
-Half-Life Alyx is a technological marvel, and easily makes up for the 15+ year wait for Half-Life 3. I can only hope Half-Life 3 is this good. Far and away one of the most incredible experiences in gaming I've ever had. I 100% recommend buying a Valve Index to play this, since the game was designed specifically for it. Being able to fully open your hand to throw objects or sift through a box of supplies is FAR more immersive, and the built-in audio system of the Index is phenomenal. Even without it though, you will enjoy this."

Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Good storyline, great visual effects, a must if you are a half life fan! VR makes it looks so real and great way to interact with puzzles, mines, loading weapons and such .... LOVE IT!"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"This is the single best game to ever be produced on the Virtual Reality platform

While that may sound like a large claim, I say that for a reason. Where do I start? The graphics? The narrative? The immersion and mechanics? Sound design?

All of them are incredible. The graphics are absolutely insane, and play in really well with the game's INCREDIBLE level of detail. Everything down to the liquid shaders in the bottles that you can pick up is literally perfected. On top of how incredibly well the graphics are done, its also rather well optimized. I did my first playthrough on an RX570 on Medium-High settings with stable frames. 

Moving on to the next point, the sound design is excellent. I think it's genuinely the most immersive-sounding game I've ever played. When you shake a bottle of liquid cleaner in the game, you can hear the liquid sloshing around in the exact direction you shake it. Just. Absolutely incredible. 

Sweet jesus, the level of detail and the physics are just. *chef kiss* MUAH. Amazing. While it might not be quite as far down to the level of super-detailed bodily physics as Boneworks, but the physics are still super well-done in the Source 2 engine. The detail just. Is literally orgasmic. The glass breaking in the game? Incredible. Amazing. The liquid shaders and sloshing sounds? Amazing. The feeling of writing/erasing on glass with markers? Amazing. There is not a single detail in this game that I could possibly think of that could've been done better.

Do I even need to talk about the story? It's absolutely, completely incredible. The climax and ending of the story literally brought me to happy, ""holy SHIT"" tears. I believe it would've brought any Half-Life fan the same feeling. The story is well thought-out, well written, and fits the world its set in incredibly well. It has some really cool moments, even before the end, that will straight-up give you chills if you're a Half-Life fan. Absolutely fucking incredible.

In conclusion: I don't care if you're not a Half-Life fan. If you own a VR HMD that can play this game, buy HL:A. It is so, so worth your time. Best VR game. Literally ever."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,Greatest video gme experience I've ever had. Hands down. A masterpiece.
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"They got VR right with ALYX!!!  
Story, Immersion, Incredible Grafx, FPS...  What VR should aspire to be IMO.

It may seem a bit short on the ""story"" mode or easy level, but it is well worth the journey for the 
suspense and lower grade battles to warm you up for dealing with Jeff on crack LOL.

No spoilers guys, I would highly recommend this if you are suited for single player / survival genre VR.

Update 6.18.21: Hungry,  going back in, must eat Snark..."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"I don't even know where to begin... as a long-time gamer and Half Life fan, and early adopter of VR (and all its shortcomings), I didn't understand the hype around this game.  I mean... a Half Life game that wasn't a shooter?  How would you get around the semi-stationary limitations of VR?  Would this be jumping from room to room, shooting at targets that pop out, then moving to the next stationary point?  How cool could that really be?

Well... let me assure you, this game is somehow better than all the (absurd amount of) hype, combined.  This is not only a showcase of what VR can be TODAY, but an incredible honor to the Half-Life franchise.  It's simply put, amazing.  The incredible detail and immersion of environments in this game, the puzzles incorporated throughout, and the semi RPG elements (customization of weapons), along with the scarcity of ammo and thus danger of encounters, makes for an amazingly tense game... and one in which I've spent far too long just looking around in awe.

This is currently THE game to try, hands down.  For the record, I'm 11 hours in and still not done - so this isn't the usual 1-2 hours of VR gameplay for $40-60.  Try it, be amazed, and get ready for what this spurs the VR industry to make next! :)

Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"VR really makes the world of Half-Life come alive in a way a tv/monitor never could. You never truly realize how large and scary headcrabs or antlions are until they're literally leaping towards you. You will not regret playing.

Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,By far the best game i've played in VR. Will take a lot to beat it. 10/10
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Valve do it again - I never thought Alyx could live up to the hype after such a long wait for a new HL, but it totally delivers in every way. The implementation of the VR is truly innovative and a huge step forward for the medium. The storyline progresses the HL lore in a meaningful way (despite its prequel status) and the mixture of puzzles, action and horror is every bit as polished as you'd expect from a game from the HL tag.

You know you've played a masterpiece when you can't stop thinking about it days after finishing. A MUST have for any PC gamer"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"I ordered a full setup just for Alyx, as I didn't have a PC, so spent about 2.5k on a setup just for this one game, worth every penny."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"One of the best made VR games currently available, hands down."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Arguably the best VR game out there. When i first bought a VR i came across loads of games that either sacrifice Graphic details for VR mechanics or the other way around. Half-Life Alyx has both amazing VR mechanics and great graphical detail.

Pro's
-One of the best games out there on the VR Market
-Story line is great (So far of writing this review)
-Gun & Tool use is really fun and addictive, just dont stream it cause it looks like you are playing another 18+ game if you know what i mean.
-I think its worth the price
- It makes me look like a twisted individual-  Yes, pulling a corpses head up and shooting it whilst the blood splatters everywhere is really fun.

Cons
-Lacks the half-life nostalgia, i think if this was called something else and not linked to half life at all other peoples perception and expectations would of been abit lower. But because it had the Half Life brand i was expecting abit more.
-perhaps a bigger use of enviromental tools such as metal poles, dustbin lids etc would of been fun to kill things with.

Overall i would highly recommend this game unless you were a die hard Half-Life fan.
"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Alyx is absolutely ridiculous!
It has no right being this good!

Best VR experience I've had by a long shot, and a beautiful addition to the HL series.

Also, Fuck Jeff!"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Flippen epic, can't wait for half life 3 :0"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"What can I say.. A truly immersive experience.
HL2:E2 left me (and probably everyone else) with a feeling of confusion and a need for more informations. HL:Alyx is everything i didn't expect form a narrative point and I loved it. A must play for any HL fan and every VR owner. graphics are beautiful and polished. the controls are the most comfortable I have tried so far in VR and the general experience is awesome. I did experience some motion sickness at first with the head relative movement option but after a couple of play sessions the feeling went away flawlessly."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Played on Oculus Rift

Ever since playing Half-life 2 on a broken Orange Box disk for the Xbox 360 I've been an avid Half-Life fan for years. While I was upset that Alyx was VR exclusive, I was excited that now I had a reason to get a VR headset. Of course it would take an entire year for me to actually get one and play the game, but regardless of that fact I have a lot to say about it.

The first thing is, even with an under-powered and last gen VR headset like mine, Alyx is still playable and 100% enjoyable. The only real downside I felt from this set up was it felt like Alyx needed some prescription glasses through the game as the screen is somewhat low resolution and the lack of any front facing camera's made it so that turning around made the game unplayable as the two lighthouses the headset came with is not enough to look behind you.

The main issue I had going into this game was the stuttering. The game was unplayable when I first loaded it up as everything was stuttering hardcore. My system is well above requirements and the VR headset was, although not suited, fully capable of playing the game. By the time of writing Half-Life Alyx is a year old and its honestly really terrible that Valve has not fixed this issue yet. I fixed it by searching online and following a guide, but for a game released in 2020, and the game that is supposed to push VR into the mainstream its unacceptable that so many people have this issue.

But regardless of that, Valve really did their homework for this game. It feels like they play tested this game with every single VR headset, control scheme and room size in mind and made options for all of them. The only downside I feel like is that you don't really know what you need until you are in the game, meaning you have to dig through the options to find it. As a ""baby's first"" VR game, I feel like if you did an action that had an option in the menu, if you hovered over for it and opened up the menu it should open up that option. I had no idea I could physically climb up ladders or be sucked up by Barnacles until 3/4th's in the game. 

The amount of love and care with the VR experience that went into this game is amazing, my only gripe is that I feel like they went ""too far"" into the accessible direction. For instance the weapons. You get three. A pistol, shotgun and SMG with no melee weapon. While all in all not bad, when compared to other Half-Life games it almost feels like a slap in the face. I know they didnt add Melee and Two Handed Weapons because they are awkward to hold in VR, but it just made the game feel less like I had less of a choice of how I wanted to take out enemies. You could of easily fixed this by the upgrade system slowly changing the weapon into a different style. All the upgrades really did was hold more ammo, auto reload or added a sight. I never picked the auto-reload because the charm of manually reloading was honestly a reward of VR in of itself.

To add to this, there was no fun ""other"" weapons that Half-Life is known for to spice up combat. While we had the ""Russell's"" to fill the gravity gun aspect, I feel like some kind of Tau-Gun or Crossbow. The game felt limited in it's options for dealing with combat scenarios, which is ironic for it's VR gameplay

One last thing about the combat and I feel like I will be in the minority. I really wish you could switch what hand your weapon was in.  In the heat of battle the only way to heal yourself is with one of the syringes that you kept in your wrist's. That would be fine if the syringe was in the gun hand and your free hand was open, but if its not you have to change to your hand, take out the healing item use it and change back. This is even more annoying if you want to use a grenade as the amount of time to change you might as well forget the grenade and just shoot anyway. If we could be able to switch our weapons from hand to hand I feel like the game play opportunities would really blossom. I personally had my weapons in the left handed position because my dominant right hand was better at picking up objects. This could be eliminated if we could just freely move the weapon from hand to hand.

I know I did a lot of complaining but Half-Life Alyx is the pinnacle of what VR gaming should be and its capabilities. I wish it went a bit further and was not so afraid to push the boundaries, but for what the game is, its great. If you have a VR headset get it. If you dont have a VR headset and want to play it, buy both. The game is so good i would 100% recommend going on your local craigslist, kijiji or facebook market place and buying a second hand VR headset and getting this game. when you are done just sell it and have Alyx as a memory. Thats probably what I'm going to do."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"In my 25 years of life this is the first video game I have ever played, all the others were nothing but mere shades on true glory."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,Yeah if you have a vr headset this is pretty much a must have.
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,the best VR game ever made
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Half Life 2 and Black Mesa have long since been my favourite games of all time. This has surpassed them in story, gameplay, enemy variety, Intensity, and just fun. It doesn't take long between new enemy types before you have set strats for each new enemy and then combining that with fighting multiple types at once leads to rewarding and extremely satisfying firefights and resource management. My New All Time favourite Valve fucking did it again only wished it was longer. The ending blew me away and puts conventional half life to shame."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,The game really gives you a glimpse of the future of gaming.  Please play this on a G2 Headset on full res youre doing the game a disservice playing it on anything else. The amount of work and detail is just insane. Greatest gaming experience since playing Mass Effect for the first time a decade ago.
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Do not buy this game - it will utterly spoil you, just like how your big phat mommy milker GF spoils you with 3090 GTX Ti's, just for laying your head on her silky thighs.

Indeed - if you buy this game, your expectations for VR, and VR titles in general will be so astronomically high, you will never be able to turn back.

Half-Life Alyx is perhaps the finest VR gaming experience to date. Play it if you dare. Its physics are unparalleled, and its gun play superb."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"I have finally found a cat, thank you Valve. "
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Quest users don't be discouraged! I am using a Quest 1 and my PC specs are: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Super, AMD Ryzen 5 3500, 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM (The other stuff isn't as important to tell you) but my PC is well below the recommended specs, listed under the games info, but using virtual desktop and wiring my PC up to my router and upgrading to 5ghz on my quest, it still has amazing graphics and no lag! BUY THIS GAME! 60 BUCKS IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT YOU GET OUT OF IT!"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Most of us know why HL: Alyx doesn't have a number on its name. Still, and for me personally, it is on the same level as HL1 and HL2 in terms of impact and relevance. Best VR game ever. One of the best games ever done, period. Really looking forward to what comes next."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"For me, this is pretty much the [i]landmark[/i] example for a high-budget VR game.

Across the environments, sound design and action pieces, everything works together to provide a sense of immersion that I haven't gotten from any other medium.

No gimmicks, this is just a solid experience all around."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,Masterpiece!
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"[h1]HALF-LIFE: ALYX... TL;DR: BEST VR GAME EVER MADE, PERIOD[/h1]


And voilà... after ending my Half-Life revisit from Half-Life 1, HL1: Opposing Force, HL1: Blue Shift, Half-Life 2, HL2: Episode 1 & 2 and BLACK MESA DEFINITIVE EDITION, here come's HALF-LIFE: ALYX, the promising and outstanding VR experience that truly redefines how a Virtual Reality game plays out.


So what can be said about HALF-LIFE: ALYX? BEST VR GAME TO DATE. No motion sickness, truly amazing visuals, sounds. The gameplay mechanic are frickin' well made too with the satisfying gunplay and the usage of the ""Russell's"", aka the gravity gloves. The story, while minimalistic, is excellent and yes, this game is officially HL2 prequel but the story pans out until the very cliffhanger ending of EPISODE 2. 

I played HL:A on the Oculus Rift Consumer Version 1 (OR CV1) and while the sensors have issues at times, it wasn't too bad here. 

[h1]So what's HALF-LIFE: ALYX?[/h1]
[b]You are ALYX VANCE, daughter of the resistance leader ELI VANCE. When the game startup, you see that the COMBINE invaded the Earth and are in control. Your dad found some info by digging in naughty Combine places and these foes are pursuing him. Once he got caught, that is where your adventure is on the rail. You have to find out what that Combine Superweapon is all about and you must undergo quarantine zone deep in Combine territory, inside CITY 17. 

Thing is, CITY 17 is still under construction. You get to see the scope of the whole ""Combine-fication"" of the town all the while, exploring the quarantine zone that's overrun with XEN flora. The visuals there are just breathtaking!

Along the way, you get to meet a resistance fighter/scavenger named Larry. You get to see Vortigaunts as well!

The more your adventure moves on, you are then informed that the Combine Superweapon isn't a weapon... more of a big Vault instead.

Without revealing too much else, this game ends with a BIG cliffhanger. THIRTEEN YEARS LATER after Episode 2 and this is what we do get now. I was excited to see where the story was going with Alyx but now, the way HL:A ended, man I don't want to wait another 10 Years to see the continuation. [/b]


[h1]PROS:[/h1]
[b]+OUTSTANDING VR VISUALS. THE BEST THERE IS TODAY. 
+No motion sickness that you usually get in VR games.
+The controls works good (Played on Oculus Rift CV1).
+GREAT, FUN gameplay and challenging too (at times!)
+GOOD story.
+Revisiting old enemies... and new ones!
[/b]


[h1]CONS:[/h1]
[b]-Sensory issues at times (more likely due with my Oculus Rift CV1 devices).
-Annoying little Gnomsky sh!thead that you gotta carry around from the whole game! [/b]


[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]
[b]BEST VR GAME TO DATE. I finished this game twice to get all achievements at first but the second playthrough was much more enjoyable honestly. The game controlled better the second time, somehow!

You don't really require to have played previous Half-Life games to play ALYX but it helps a ton! The game itself is quite long for a VR title. It took Valve thirteen years to release something new in the Half-Life universe and while many are still pissed they decided to go the VR route, this is an excellent spinoff game and like the many fans, I really hope Valve won't make us wait too long for more Half-Life games. 

Half-Life: Alyx is a great story continuation, a great VR game worthy to play if you have the technology. Would this game work in non-VR mode? I'd think yes. Maybe Valve would release it later in standard format. So let's wait and see what Valve is cooking right now! I wouldn't mind another VR project but I fully expect Valve to release a full fledged Half-Life game with our legendary Gordon Freeman... in Episode 3? Half-Life 3? 

Only the G-MAN knows...[/b]

Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,非常好玩的游戏，就是有点可怕
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,Can't say I've ever played anything like Half-Life: Alyx. Probably the most innovative title made during the last decade and a must play if you have an VR set.
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"if you ever get a vr headset PLEASE PLAY THIS GAME!!!! this is the best vr game ive ever played, possibly the best game ive ever played ever. The 60 dollars is SO worth it! Please buy this game!!!!"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"This game technically costs 660 dollars.

It's worth it"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Steam reviews have one problem. You can only choose between ""Yes"" and ""No"". But.. Half Life Alyx is neither...

I need MORE than just ""yes"". I need a ""JUST PLAY IT"" button. This is by far the best VR game ever created, and its close to be one of my favorite games too. I am absolutely sure you won't regret. So yeah, JUST PLAY IT."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,Sublime example of what vr gaming should be.
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Classic Valve, giving us the best games and making us want more"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,Game changer! Pure masterpiece!
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Very good and fun, as usual. My first proper VR game. More of an experience than a game IMO. 

Found myself trying to pick up stuff in the real world by pointing at it and flicking my wrist.

Proof that valve can do good stuff even in current time. Well until they get bored of VR. Let's hope that doesn't happen soon."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"PROOF THAT VR IS THE FUTURE

Wow. 

When I built a computer, it was specifically to play Cyberpunk 2077 (look, I liked its potential) and VR. I knew about Half Life: Alyx being the ""premiere"" VR experience but I did not anticipate it setting a bar that, honestly, who knows when it'll be reached again. It was everything I love about video games. And brought into a virtual space. Exploration. Story. Smart combat. And a sense of humor.

For one, the way you can flick and catch items from across the room is ENDLESSLY fun. Just walking around a space, opening cabinets, finding items, flicking and grabbing and tossing things into your backpack. ENDLESSLY FUN. The game is also paced wonderfully. No section was too long. Too short. Too difficult. The puzzles were what you'd expect from the folks who brought you Portal. There were a few times that I was stumped but just long enough for me to turn around and see an overlooked solution. Everything about this game is satisfaction. Everything just works. And the character designs, perfect. They were believable and real and yet never crossed the Uncanny Valley.

There were times that I felt myself walking through a haunt at Halloween Horror Nights. And, my favorite section, which I assume is the showpiece of the entire game... [spoiler] the whole entire Jeff chapter. [/spoiler] I said aloud, a number of times, this is incredible. It felt like Valve was playing right along side me, knowing how to push the right buttons. To surprise when you least expect it and even when you're expecting. It subverted all expectations. What a joy to play this game.

It's a true master work of gaming.

For me, this will be the game that defines the gold standard of virtual reality. The gun play was amazing. The reload animation and gestures were a small challenge to learn but became almost second nature by the end. And almost... it would feel weird without grabbing from your backpack, shoving a mag into the gun and pressing the button. ALWAYS PRESS THE BUTTON. ;) 

I can't say enough about Alyx other than, go now. Please. Enjoy it. 

I played Half Life 2 many a year ago and don't really know the lore that well and the only time I think I missed more ""oh shit"" story moments was towards the end. If you haven't played them, def do so before or at least read/watch a little refresher -- think it'll give a bit more context about the world, which you're immediately thrust into without much backstory. 

This game is fun, scary as hell, funny, and a total absolute joy. Please. Make it happen. Do it. Play this game. And I hope every VR developer takes note. Also, I hope the ""Russells"" become a VR staple bc IT IS ENDLESSLY FUN TO FLICK AND CATCH. ENDLESS! I am sad I can't do it in real life. 

I happily rate this a 5.

1 - Ungood, 2 - Disappointing, 3 - Worth It, 4 - Surprising, 5 - Masterpiece"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Probably the best game I've ever played, honestly."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,Best Game in VR!
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,Absolutely master piece. Also scared the shit out of me.
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Most VR is gimmicky. No surprise here, Valve gets it right. This plays like a Half Life game - a balanced mix of physics puzzles, corridor shooting, and gross stuff. But I think it reveals that VR is the right platform for that kind of experience. The puzzles are more tactile, the shooting (which would feel very bland otherwise) is tense, and the alien sludge makes you physically uncomfortable. It works.

Valve does a good job enabling and rewarding fun interactions (like committing reload actions to muscle memory, or poking a door open with the end of a pistol to check inside) while bypassing annoying ones you'd find in a less thoughtful game (like having to bend down to pick things up). 

Beyond just the VR novelty, the level design is top-notch as usual. You'll find the game pulls pranks on you frequently. I particularly liked (and despised) the J*** segment. You can hear the game designer saying, ""yup, now you have to do this.""

If you've got VR capabilities, you ought to give it a go. If not, even as a VR skeptic, it's worth keeping on your radar should you ever upgrade your PC."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"A worthy addition to the Half-Life series. Very likely the best in the series. I haven't finished the game yet. If my opinion changes by the end of the game, I will update my review. Someone let Valve know we need more Valve made VR games."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,hello gordon
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,Been playing half-life games since 1999. This game is the reason I bought VR gear. As my first experience in VR I wasn't sure I had what it takes to play this game. I was completely freaked out for pretty much all of the quarantine zone. Especially that first encounter with a headcrab zombie-- it was just so real looking and I didn't want to go anywhere near it. Now I'm on my 3rd time playing through it because I can't get enough.
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Play this fucking game, it's everything it's cracked up to be"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"I was one of the people that we're saying Half-Life would never work in VR. It's only until you stand up and play it that you understand why they went with VR. While VR will never overtake pancake gaming, it can co-exist with it as a proper alternative to gaming. Props to everyone who worked on this masterpiece."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,The best experience you will have in VR
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,probably one of the best vr experiences that will ever be created. absolutely perfect.
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,best game.
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,Absolutely nuts. this game is a must buy for vr gamers. the story is great and gameplay is astounding. plus the physics are god. one downside is that the game is designed for the index so some actions are a bit strange if you've played other first person vr shooters. overall this game is totally worth the hefty price tag.
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,I hate headcrabs
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Exemplary on what future of VR gaming might look like. Fantastic attention to detail and in my view the most intuitive controls, especially when it comes to the use of gravity gloves! 

Perhaps the only annoyance is the frequent mini-puzzles to unlock chests / lockers. It's fun the first couple of times but then it is just a nuisance that you need to deal with. I wish there was an option to upgrade your hacking tool to auto-hack these locks."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"This was a fantastic game. So many cool things to do and it really shows what can be done with VR. Just need more big publishers to put some money behind some VR games and we can see even more games this good. If you have a VR headset you definitely should have Alyx. A cool story and cool surprise. Lets see some more greatness Valve.

This game helped me build my VR legs too so I can quit using teleport moving which really sucks. Continuous locomotion is the only way to play games like this. I also plan on going back and getting the rest of the achievements to 100% this baby."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Half-Life: Alyx is a great game. It's an awesome VR game too.

What you need to understand is that Alyx is not the end-all-be-all of VR. There are other arguably better experiences out there. Alyx is not trying to be the best VR game, it's simply trying to be the best Half-Life game it can be and it happens to be in VR.

However, what it does do best are graphics and exploration. And boy are these great. Finding resin in remote corners of each level gives players a reason to grab every little prop to see the amazing detail Valve has put into them. You'll find yourself just looking at your hands in disbelief to see the tiny capacitors and wires that make up the gravity gloves. 

""How does this look so good and run like this?""
(It's a little CPU heavy, though. Just FYI)

I have played this all the way through with an Oculus Rift CV1 and the Valve Index. The experiences are pretty much the same. Which might be surprising! The resolution on the Index is insane at first, and the hand presence is incredible. But after you get over the initial wow factor, you just play the game! And it plays great on any headset you can get your hands on.

TL;DR
-It's got amazing graphics!
-Great story.
-I have first hand experiences on a low-end headset (CV1) and the Index and can confirm a great experience on both. 
-This game is a little CPU heavy, so make sure you PC is at least above the minimum."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,The best game I've ever played. It feels amazing. Gameplay is fantastic. Story is excellent.
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,very good game although its mostly puzzles with not too much combat but its still there. i think the game is good but too get the best value i say wait for a sale on the game before you buy it.

Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"HL:Alyx is the gold standard for VR titles, and it's a little sad that nothing else has come close to this level of quality and attention to detail.

Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Almost flawless game. Had a problem with 1 puzzle but that was my own problem. This has been set for VR and it has been set HIGH.

Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"A really nice game, very good graphics and eviroment :))"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"What is Valve?

A valve is a device or natural object that regulates, directs or controls the flow of a fluid (gases, liquids, fluidized solids, or slurries) by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various passageways. Valves are technically fittings, but are usually discussed as a separate category. In an open valve, fluid flows in a direction from higher pressure to lower pressure. The word is derived from the Latin valva, the moving part of a door, in turn from volvere, to turn, roll.

The simplest, and very ancient, valve is simply a freely hinged flap which swings down to obstruct fluid (gas or liquid) flow in one direction, but is pushed up by the flow itself when the flow is moving in the opposite direction. This is called a check valve, as it prevents or ""checks"" the flow in one direction. Modern control valves may regulate pressure or flow downstream and operate on sophisticated automation systems.

Valves have many uses, including controlling water for irrigation, industrial uses for controlling processes, residential uses such as on/off and pressure control to dish and clothes washers and taps in the home. Even aerosol spray cans have a tiny valve built in. Valves are also used in the military and transport sectors. In HVAC ductwork and other near-atmospheric air flows, valves are instead called dampers. In compressed air systems, however, valves are used with the most common type being ball valves.

Explained why Valve so important in this game involved in many puzzles, door lock and underground areas, which most of the creatures were having half life, Alien is our friend and Zombies is not. What is left for dead."

South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,RPG,213670,"Coming back to the game after more than five years, I had forgotten how funny this was. It is difficult to say if the game, or its cartoonish predecessor, excelled at the no-holds-barred satire and dark humor where nothing is held sacred... especially for the game's protagonist, ""Douchebag"". (It should be noted that this game is [i]definitely [u]not[/u][/i] for kids, for obvious reasons.)

Aside from a couple of non-game breaking bugs, my only complaint is that this game is way too short. I would love it if the Obsidian developers would take a page from Postal II and expand the game to fill an entire week. For example, if the protagonist started his adventure on a Sunday, leaving the following days until Tuesday - why not create a few more DLCs to include Wed., Thurs., Fri. [i]and[/i] Saturday. This game would be worth it then to revisit with fresh content! 😍

Note: If you're playing for the achievements, you could probably do the majority in one playthrough - but with several reloads - and two for sure. It took me a total of three playthroughs to get all of the achievements, including those I earned years ago because I was casually playing back then."
South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,RPG,213670,It's Awesome.
South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,RPG,213670,"good game, good story line and the humour is just what you expect from southpark.
Only thing is: after finishing the game twice i noticed that i played the game just to get the achievement, not because i enjoyed it."
South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,RPG,213670,"If you're a fan of South Park, I highly recommend you get this game. There is a TON of South Park humor in this game, which is exactly what you want from this kind of game. The RPG elements are a bit limited, but not so limited that you feel like it's lacking. It just feels a bit dumbed-down, but that by no means makes the game bad. 

Anyone going for achievements, you can get 100% in one solid run. Might have to reload a couple times to different spots in the game to clean up loose ends but that is no big deal. Took me about 10 hours total. TIP: If you're trying to collect all the weapons and costumes, you do NOT need to have them all in your inventory at the same time. For some reason, not a single guide I read mentioned this. You just need to pick up the item one time and it will count towards your collection. This means you don't need to do unnecessary grinding for cash, simply collect everything until the end of the game, then sell everything to buy what you're missing. This also goes for items sold only in Canada. Simply sell items to the shops there and they will give Canadian currency. :)"
South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,RPG,213670,A bit glitchy when it comes to audio but other than that i love this game. the references are hilarious and well thought out. ive always loved the show its nice to play something where i feel like im apart of it. Overall id give this game a 9/10 it would be a 10/10 if there where no bugs in audio and very rarely combat but dont let that deter you. This game will have you playing and laughing for hours.
The Room VR: A Dark Matter,Adventure,1104380,"Please dont pay $30 for this. VR adds nothing to the game. Since it has predefined standing spots with locked degrees of view rotation, you're always just looking at a 2D picture of a 3D scene. It's also very easy. The puzzles feel like you're just going through the motions. ""Move around a small number of predefined standing spots, each containing keys for the other spots, which you unlock one at a time. Continue cycling around the spots moving 1 item at a time until something ominous happens. Change scene."" 

Oh and I guess there's a story in there somewhere."
The Room VR: A Dark Matter,Adventure,1104380,"The Room VR stands out as one of the most beautiful, well crafted and ambitious VR puzzle games I’ve played since Xing The Land Beyond. What I really love about it is how it leans heavily into VR strengths— particularly with its clever use of scale. It’s something only VR can do and is very well implemented in this game.  For example you can shrink and step into a keyhole to unlock a door from the inside. Or you’ll step inside a church organ to fix the broken pipes- with its inter workings becoming the game level.  Actually standing inside these impossibly small locations is just a surreal experience.  The puzzles themselves are fun as well.  You turn gears and pull knobs which give off satisfying clicky, sounds and haptic feedback, lending them a tactile quality.  The level of detail and interaction through is just stunning.  Excellent game worth every penny especially if you like puzzle games."
The Room VR: A Dark Matter,Adventure,1104380,"There are two types of people, those who love The Room series, and those who haven't played it yet. Not much to say besides I will sell my house to keep Fireproof Studios in business because they are masters Craftsmen (get it?) of these games. When The Room 1 came out it masterfully turned the mobile experience into an immersive interactive journey, and with A Dark Matter they have surpassed their former efforts ten fold.

Funnily enough I didn't find the play time short at all, may be because I got stuck in one particular part of the game. The puzzles are not as challenging as those in the previous The Room games but it is still one hell of an amazing experience.

Buy it, play it, love it. What are you waiting for?"
The Room VR: A Dark Matter,Adventure,1104380,"Really fun escape room game! Playing in VR was a while new experience, and they added really fun scenes in it for VR. We played in a group and took turns wearing the headset, really smooth game."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Vanilla game: 2/10, bland, empty, not too much content.

Modded game: fucking 10/10, incredible, so much potential for fun and exploration, building, RP, etc. 
The modding community for this game is unreal, one of the best modding communities I've ever seen for a game. Modded Starbound is the complete experience. 

I'd recommend Frackin' Universe + the related Frackin' mods if you're looking for good mods."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,its like terraria but not
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Terraria in space with mods, I love it."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Starbound overall is an absolutely fantastic game. The amount of content available in this game is incredible, and the game is still engaging after clocking 250+ hours. The random generation of planets, dungeons, and weapons keeps the game fresh, even after you have explored every system, planet, and moon in the universe. You never get to see everything, no matter how long you play the game for.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

   - Massive universe to explore, no matter how long you play, you will never explore it all.
   - Random generation creates fun and sometimes wacky planet types, every planet feels unique in its own right.
   - Super fun to play with friends, the adventure never ends.
   - This game is a builder's paradise. Paint, wiring, 100s of blocks to build with, let your creativity run free.
   - The music in Starbound fits absolutely perfectly. Curtis Schweitzer did an [b]incredible[/b] job with making the universe feel more lively and mysterious when it needs to be.
   - By far the most incredible part of this game is the [b]ATMOSPHERE[/b]. Some of the best moments in Starbound is when the atmosphere is just [i]right[/i]. Rainy nights in a small wooden house, standing by an ocean in the dead of night, some moments can give you the chills.

I praise Starbound for everything it has done right, but there are a few complaints I have with the game, though they are quite small and not game breaking.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

   - You may have heard this from other people before, but the optimisation is not the best. At some points, even on the best of PCs, the game will either freeze for a split second, enemies may stop attacking, and your character may not deal damage.
   - Another thing you may have heard before is the linear storyline. Yes, on your first playthrough this type of story is great, but after many playthroughs, it starts to feel annoying. The storyline isn't necessary for you to progress in terms of items, but helps to aid in terms of exploration. Heck, you can get top tier armour after the first mission.

Overall, Starbound is a game that you can really get stuck into once you complete it the first time. With random generation, plenty of items and cosmetics to collect and the ability to play with friends, Starbound is incredible in both singleplayer and multiplayer.

Overall, I give Starbound a 9/10."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"I. Love. This. Game.

The art style is absolutely beautiful. Coupled with the incredible amount of items you can collect is mind blowing.

This game alloys you to create an absolutely stunning amount of visually beautiful structures. The questline is cool, and the characters are actually really likeable! There are so many different things to collect too. From fossils, the fish, to little critters you might find on different planets with different atmospheres. Being able to terraform an entire planet and build it exactly the way you want to is just fantastic. Especially when you've been travelling the stars for weeks, only to head back on home to see where it all started.. 

You've also got a pretty cool wiring system you can play with too, to make lights turn on when you open doors, or path a rail with a cart on it, that can take you all over your world, with customisable junctions too! There are timer blocks and delay blocks as well. Wiring stuff up after you've created a structure is super fun.

The crafting in this game is forgiving too. Instead of what most games do: ""you need 5000 iron to craft this one block lol"", the recipes are super reasonable. but still challenging enough that you will still need to make recourse runs. The difficulty curve is exceptional too. Once you have started collecting iron, and upgrading your ship, armour, weapons ect, you'll have to head out of your cozy little start system, to another more hostile one, to find better ores. Travelling the stars is fantastic!

The music in this game is absolutely stunning. The theme song for this game is enough to bring a tear to your eye. This is an absolute GEM of a game, so i highly, HIGHLY recommend it. This game has brought me many memories with friends and my partner, that i will never, ever forget."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"after playing this game for a week or 2 now. i feel i know what resonates with me about this game.

If I were in the mood to play a game of this kind, id go between 3. Minecraft, Terraria, and Starbound. each appeals to a different part of why i love these block-based games with exploration and such.

Minecraft is my go-to if I want to build, Terraria is for if I want a good combat and boss encounter. Starbound is for the Exploration and seeing what the world's gonna have. This game, with its varying worlds and randomly spawned in villages of each race and small mini dungeons and houses make this game feel super alive and vibrant. Minecraft and Terraria are about being the only one to colonize or truly try and experience things in your world. Here it feels like you are going out across a vast universe and finding groups everywhere, you aren't alone in this universe. You can make your own township, or ""colony"", on a world, travel around it and find a massive temple of Floran origin, and its amazing! my fondest memories so far are moments where I was just walking on a new planet, and finding these massive complexes stretching for ages underground when I wasn't even expecting to find it on this random desert planet I decided to land on to pick up a few pieces of Tungsten"
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Starbound is a very fun game in the same art style as Terraria with similar controls and exploration ""gameplay loops."" While similar to Terraria in terms of how the player obtains loot and how monsters and the environment are generated, in SB you travel to different solar systems and planets with multiple biomes that feel like a mini-world from Terraria. The loot and monsters are RNG drawn from tables associated with the planet type (snow, desert, forest, jungle, volcanic, etc.) There are also some core missions that are tracked within the in-game log journal for easy reference, in direct contrast the often-inscrutable summoning requirements for some of Terraria's bosses. The game itself is very fun - exploring new worlds, finding equipment and cosmetic armor that range from neat space marine-type clothing to unicorn masks and pirate gear, or weapons like stun batons, rocket launchers, machine pistols, broadswords, or magic wands and staves.

All of the above would earn SB a ""Recommended"" here, HOWEVER, there is a persistent issue with regular, consistent lag spikes that has been known and not patched since at least 2017.

These lag spikes effect the player's orientation in the world against other objects, leading to many, MANY otherwise avoidable deaths due to long drops, enemy teleporting due to the latency catching up, and even falling off of platforms and rail systems that you set up for yourself - EVEN IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE WITH ALL MULTIPLAYER AND INTERNET CONNECTION TURNED OFF.

I can honestly say I enjoy each of the 29 seconds of gameplay between lag spikes much more than Starbound's closest cousin Terraria, but the lag has made playing on anything other than casual to be an exercise in frustration.

Do yourself a favor and watch a Let's Play or YT walkthrough for this game, enjoy seeing the neat monsters and sights and the Pokemon-style monster pod capturing, and then pat yourself on the back for saving yourself from spending $15 USD on a game that the developers once loved but then abandoned, unfinished, but left it on the Steam storefront for full price. 

If the lag issue is ever officially patched, then I would definitely recommend this game."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"The base game is quite fun with its humor, base building and exploration, has a pretty good story to go along with the building and progression in which it can guide you through to end game.
"
Starbound,Adventure,211820,every time i look in my library and see this game i get immensely sad
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"game had a lot of potential, but was cut too short by lack of updates / meaningful progression / terrible story.

you can get hooked on the progression, but the different progression systems feel disjoint and meaningless, and stop abruptly without much impact. 

it feels hollow, but at least the music is good. 

"
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"was a really good game, like a interesting mix of terraria and no man's sky but with the updates ended being the worst of both, gear is based on RNG so there is no way to guarantee to get better loot even after hours of looting, also the crafting system of weapons is useless because of that, i think most of the players in this game say that playing with Frackin Universe is a must because starbound vanilla have almost no content, better go buy no man's sky if you want to explore or terraria if you want a sandbox with some rpg flavor, but don't buy this game to play vanilla, is not worth."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,A game that started out with so much promise and potential but ultimately ended up drowning in it's own shallow mediocrity.
Starbound,Adventure,211820,an amazing story and gameplay much like terraria but with more content
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"you can strip your crew of clothing, beds, heat, food, and happiness

Starbound,Adventure,211820,"I cant really write i review for this game because i have the same complaints as everyone else. that being said, i will still shortly list my complaints


lacking vanilla experience
you have to try to make the game fun for yourself, modded or not.
dont go to starbound community tab. worst mistake of my life!
progression is so linear its funny
bossfights are either unfair or wayyyy tooo easy
scan for clues is ass
weapons feel weak no matter what you do
tech upgrades should be upgrades, not sidegrades
Lore for this game is TRASH. do NOT go on the wiki. im not asking for berserk but good lord at least try. 
avali wankers make me puke
novakid players are weird. really weird.
NPCs are trash
OST is trash, yet somehow memorable (shouldve been synthwave or jungle, but we got orchestral shit)
the instruments dont sound good
the station looks like shit and half the NPCs there are annoying or dont do anything
you can beat the game by going to like 5 stars out of the 5 kabillion
all planets feel the same, this game needs better textures badly
erchius ghost is either unfair or way too easy
should have a leveling system, not just random armor stat buffs that dont allow you to have a build
the devs for this game are absolute shitheads. they have no idea what they are doing
all the letsplays for this game are sickening furry orgies
multiplayer is a pain in the ass.
you HAVE to get lucky enough to find a teleporter core if you even want to TRY to make a base
base building is booboo and the best materials you have to steal from other npc bases
matter manipulator upgrades feel like trash
think how much money this game wouldve made if they hired HOME or oddling to do the OST. 
i guess they had no budget? ive heard many people say the game was better in beta than it was now lmao


i was able to write better lore for this game than the actual writers and they're getting paid to do it. thats a big issue.
"
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"[h1] Chucklefish did not pay a 16 year-old, who worked 2 years on the game, a cent of cash. [/h1]
Now that I have your attention: look, the game is actually pretty okay, and I really do enjoy some of the aspects of it, but as someone who hasn't played it in years because 

1. The combat got stale within the first two days of playing it
2. The progression was hardly linear; it was so frustrating to find out what I should do if I really wanted to progress a certain plot or sideplot
3. I had more fun with roleplaying rather than the game itself

I should give you a very, very serious warning that is beyond any kind of personal interest: there's been some serious allegations within the last couple of years that claims the devs behind Chucklefish (at least a dozen) were completely unpaid for their work, not to mention there's been [i] at least one [/i] individual who was asked to do an incredible amount of work (i.e. the entire soundtrack) completely unpaid.

Side with whichever side you like, but I personally am NOT interested in that kind of corporate bullshittery. This is an indie company! This isn't some huge, triple-A project or studio that should even remotely have this kind of stupidity and exploitation happening."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,this game ruined my life
Starbound,Adventure,211820,space is cool
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"I got this game on sale because my friends were playing it. It's not terrible in concept, but it is just not original. All of the fun parts of this game have come from other sources. The small amount of lore is very cliche. But even beyond un-originality I have one major problem with this game.

The tutorial SUCKS. Like it is absolutely wretched - one of the worst I've ever seen.
First steps in the game are very scripted and super uninteresting. Once you finally get into the actual world, the tutorial pop-ups are mixed in with wordy lore, and they disappear, never to be seen again after 5 seconds, so if you miss it, it's gone forever.
I have had to read through stupid amounts of google just to figure out how to click a dang button I didn't even know existed, or to try a control option I swear I had tried before.

The crafting system is a slog because it requires lugging around like 10 different crafting stations, each with 3 or 4 different tabs, none of which are difficult to craft, and none of which gate off any real progression.

The trading prices are wretched. Like yeah resources are unlimited, but your stuff sells for nothing, and everything costs a ton - but far more egregious is the idea that 90% of your inventory actually doesn't have any value other than as cosmetic building blocks. The trees you chop down - the sand you mine, the cobblestone, it all has 0 value. You can mine thousands and get 0 of the common currency.

The combat is somewhat interesting, but very clunky.

If you want to pick this up to play with friends, have at, but be warned it's merely mediocre at best, and very cumbersome at its worst."

Starbound,Adventure,211820,it's a good. get.
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Replayability is garbage because of the tedious mandatory 1-2 hour starter quests (for the ship repair + mech). Don't know what the devs were smoking when they added that in.
Don't get me wrong, I don't totally hate Starbound. But this stuff made me really frustrated.
These issues can be fixed through mods, but you don't review a game by its mod community."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Highly recommended for you who enjoy general pixel game and especially if you have a creative mind. If not for the large variety of designs you can delve into, the fact that you can be a bird wearing a cardboard box on your head, dressed in a wedding attire and can fire a rocket launcher should definitely win you over. Go for it!"

Starbound,Adventure,211820,"i suppose i should write a review to my most beloved game
ive seen it at its best, at its worst
been here since furious koala...back when we had a fancy launcher
anyways, on with the actual review
over 2,5k hours(steam is glitched), 2/3 are vannilla
most fun i ever had was and forever will be being stuck on a barren planet making a colony during cheerful giraffe

i dont think i can do a proper review, it would mostly just be like a memoir, so if anyone cares bout this randoms actual views, leave a comment under this"
Starbound,Adventure,211820,I can be monke
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"I love this game to bits, every part of it. Such a rich universe and an awesome system for building a ship, a house, a colony, a city, even a space station!!"
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"I loved playing this game, it was fun until I encountered performance issues. I then upgrade to a higher performance computer. Which I noticed that help made the game run smoother. But I just don't understand why this game depends on much higher computer performance. Than the recommended specs that you've got on your store page. Plus I thought that since this game is a 2D game. I found it very displeasing how much performance it needed to stop the lag hangs etc. Where as other 2D platform games doesn't require that much performance.

If the developers was to ever fix their game performance hungry demand. I would give this game a better review. Until then I stick with this review for now!"
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"I am still struggling with the solo introduction, but I was advised by my other friends to skip the introduction; that was the best decision I had made so far. The solo was very boring and representative and serves as a means to introduce the game. The graphics are that of Terreria and it runs fine with no crashes or errors. Overall it has been a fun game that I will come back to occasionally when I want something with a little more depth than Terreria."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,g1
Starbound,Adventure,211820,Overall it's a relaxing game that's like Terraria. It has objectives that make the game feel like your actually progressing towards something but it doesn't force you to go and do them right away. On top of that the Frackin Universe mod for the game makes it even more in depth and gives you a change of pace if you are getting a bit pent up with the normal Game. Overall I'd say its worth a buy and download as something to pick up when you need a break from all of the other action packed games your use too.
Starbound,Adventure,211820,different worlds is really cool
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"The game itself is fun, but it suffers from a crippling issue: lag spikes in singleplayer. At best, they're inconvenient, but at worst, they make the game borderline unplayable, with NPCs freezing, projectiles hanging in the air, and entire chunks of the world needing several seconds to even load in. I played this on a decent PC, so I have no clue what's causing the problem. This issue has been around for at least a few years, so it doesn't seem like the developers have it marked as a priority, or they might not intend to fix it. I enjoyed the game, but unless you have the patience to deal with the lag issue, it's not something I could recommend."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"One of the best games I have ever played. There is so much content to explore and so many ways to play. Some people are turned off by the fact that you have to use your imagination sometimes, but if you do you will have one of the best experiences of your life. If you enjoy other sandbox games like Minecraft or Terraria the you will love this game. The only thing Starbound lacks is a big community."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,A fun Terraria-like game based in space! Been loving playing it.

Starbound,Adventure,211820,"The base Starbound experience is okay. I enjoyed playing it. Slashing through enemies, blasting enemies with magic, turning into Samus?, and building a settlement. It's enjoyable on its own.

Starbound,Adventure,211820,"May God forbid that this game has more good reviews. I was really deceived into buying this after seeing early access footage, many years ago, and the 93% good reviews. The sandbox feeling and the replayability of this game? Gone. There is a whole story sticking you into an unavoidable ""ooo you're in a prophecy you will save the universe now go scan this this this this and this""! If the story wasn't this annoying I would be able to go and try to play another race, another build, to enjoy this game for many hundreds more hours. Also, this game used to have planets more diverse in creatures and structures. Where's that? Also scrapped. It's been streamlined into a select few creatures and forced structures stored into a box just to fit the storyline that's been very much forced into this game. ""Oh, reviewer, there are mods! The mods will save us all!"" Yes! They will! They are amazing help if I can turn all of the negatives of this game null and make this replayable! But that only indicates how much the vanilla of this game lacks. The replayability is the problem. If you're reading this and you're about to buy the game, watch out if you want replayability. Unless you're placing mods, of course. This is not the game you're looking for if you want it in vanilla."

[b] What I Liked [/b]

It was basically a sci-fi Terraria.  I loved just going around to different planets and opening boxes to find loot.  Or, digging into the ground to find hidden areas.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

Not much!

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

Problem is I am bad at these games and quickly lose interest.  I don't do well in super open ended games, so I ended up stopping.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

Starbound,Adventure,211820,I wasn't able to stick with the game after a few hours unfortunately. Felt quite generic/underwhelming.
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Chucklefish celebrating a 10th anniversary?  It felt like this game was in ""early access"" for at least that long.  

This game has the distinction of being the game that convinced me never to buy an early access game again.  It floated around in early access, nothing more than the loose framework of a game for so, so long... features were promised... even a complete game was promised... it lingered as a barely playable experiment with performance so bad you would think it was some kid's junior high computer project... and if you had complaints, you were ignored and the excuse, the shield, of early access went on for, literally, years.  Really, there is nothing good that I can say about it.

I can not recommend buying anything from this company based on how bad this ""game"" and the experience with this game was."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"I don't remember anywhere near enough about this game to leave an honest review. But I have no problem making something up.

Starbound is the sequel to the 2011 hit ""Stardew Valley"" and it gives you a chance to further explore what happens to Star Drew after his village was burned by the Dzordan Fleet. It doesn't follow the typical, run of the mill revenge plot, and largely subverts your expectations outside of a few subtle bread crumbs left for you to find. Drew isn't out to spend another 30 years of his life fighting and waging the wars of the upper class and developer Chucklefish masterfully reflect these emotions through the presentation of the game with the use of 2D graphics.

It isn't until Act V that the story culminates and the Dzordan Fleet rear their ugly head with a plot that just can't sit with Drew. The Steam tags graciously hide this fact but the presentation is then drastically shifted. Gone are the whimsical, uplifting, and familiar feelings of a 2D  sandbox world. Now we enter back in to that harsh, 3D experience we forgot all about in Stardew Valley. At the end of this experience I was simultaneously draught of emotion yet richer than I'd ever been before. It was a lot for my psyche to handle but in the end it was completely worth it.

It will be a monumental task for Chucklefish to follow a masterpiece like this. But I'll be damned if I am not first in line to try it out. Two thumbs up and I recommend this to anyone who loves a good story."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Where Terraria is a game with little room for customization even within its modding community but has a superior base gameflow with tangible progression, Starbound is in many ways the opposite where the base game is pretty mediocre with no meaningful progression, but through the vast amount of visual and gameplay altering mods can help tailor a better experience for the individual. 

They're both games I wouldn't bother playing as a solo experience, but with Starbound this is especially the case."

It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"[h1]What I liked: [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Heartfelt and charming story and world design
    [*]Insanely creative mechanics and levels
    [*]Pacing and overall design is top tier
    [*]Humor and Dr. Hakim
 [/list]
[h1]What I didn’t like: [/h1]
[list]
   [*] Human character parts are weak
 [/list]
[h1]My Score: [/h1]
[b]A++[/b]

[h1]Quick Summary [/h1]
As a champion for unique and creative games over anything, it’s a rare when one comes out and even rarer when it happens to be a CO-OP game. The amount of content could easily be split between 2 games. The levels, mechanics, world, humor, heartfelt and pure fun this game gives, makes me not care that it’s a casual baby game in terms of challenge that I slam other games for. Here it’s so non-gamers can take part in a once in a lifetime game that will be forever loved by all and sets a new bar for co-op design.

 [h1]More in depth: [/h1]
[list]
    [*]The STORY tackles divorce and the struggles of it with a child who is caught in the middle of it. The child part on execution is the weakest part of the whole game as she is very stiff and lifeless from both writing and voice acting, and was easily joked during my playtime. The trauma even though I couldn’t imagine having gone this this isn’t to be taken lightly, but most of the human scenes you can tell it’s a budget indie game, but it doesn’t affect the overall vibe. I care more about atmosphere and feel, not graphics. Luckily the human scenes are very few and are there to push the story forward and the ending scene has the emotional impact overriding the lower budget look.

    [*]Now it’s going to be all praise from here on. First the CHARACTERS especially the eyes of the dolls make them FEEL SO ALIVE and easy to get attached to their personalities. The book character, Dr. Hakim, along with his interactions with the main characters had so many humorous moments, with the fast edits punctuating the great pacing. There are some stereotypes of certain ethic groups and some played for laughs, and the fact that the wife works and the dad stays at home to some could be controversial but it’s not that bad. Also there are some scenes and what happens to justify it can be weird, laughable and horrific without spoiling, but the absurdity of it can make it comical, we all know what that scene is, a certain animal toy.

   [*]    Speaking of pacing, THIS GAME NEVER LINGERS ON ANYTHING TOO LONG WITH SOME BEING TOO SHORT. Platforming, boss fights, cutscenes. You literally can’t get annoyed because it will be moved past in a few minutes with big sections dedicated to exploring for stuff to interact with that is optional and there are a lot of these. You can sometimes feel like a kid in a sandbox and some rewards are just nice interactables and fun distractions and others are these minigames that range from childhood classic games, a few rigged games, some lackluster and my personal favorites being shuffle board and the racing ones, that add a neat little treat for those wanting  to compete. There are 25 minigames in total, which is insane, and even after 2 playthroughs I’ve missed 4 and one is a laser tennis that I need to play

    [*] The variety in this game has you going through just about anything that exists I think, without spoiling this aspect, this is a huge praise and hard to really describe and kind of melds into the BEST ASPECT OF THE GAME, CO-OP DESIGN. Now I don’t really go in depth that often at what makes a great co-op game as most people just want something to play with their friends and are mostly just tag along games in terms of design. Here this is objectively one of the greatest co-op designed games, first as you can’t play it alone so that’s a start, even if the game isn’t for you, you can’t argue why it’s great. 

    [*] Each level has both players given a UNIQUE GIMMICK THAT FORCES EACH TO PLAY TOGETHER to solve whatever is thrown at them, whether it’s simple like you shoot the goo that so that the other can explode, to opposite magnets, different weapons and gadgets that on their own can’t win and forces “collaboration” in terms of both gameplay and also for the story in ways that fit great. While leaning on the easy side when compared to harder puzzle or platforming co-op games. None can touch the creative, charm and variety this game has for the price and content delivered and will weirdly make you look at other co-op games in a new light and make them feel lackluster in terms of this co-op design perspective.

After playing [i]A Way Out[/i] last year, it was very refreshing to play a pure co-op experience since there's not much of that on the market currently, and it left an itch that nothing's come close to scratching. So, I guess it's a good thing that Josef Fares and the talented folks at Hazelight decided to release another pure co-op game that expands upon the foundation laid by [i]A Way Out[/i] called [i]It Takes Two.[/i] And I'm happy to report that [i]It Takes Two[/i] is an incredibly entertaining experience that is a significant improvement over its prison break predecessor that surprised me in more ways than one.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

While I think most people are going to compare this game's visual style to something out of a Pixar film, I would say this game feels a lot closer to something like [i]LittleBigPlanet.[/i] It's a delight, with so much variety in the environments considering that the story is basically contained to one house. The game also did an excellent job of not being too overwhelming with color, which on top of being paired with great character designs (especially in regards to the playable characters), made everything visually distinct enough that you could tell who was supposed to interact with what without getting in the way of the style that the game was going for. While I did play this game with slightly messy settings because I was streaming it, I could tell that this game is an absolute looker in terms of its style and environments, so the game absolutely succeeded in this regard.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

As I said before, [i]It Takes Two[/i] expands on basically all of the concepts laid by its predecessor. While it is still largely a puzzle platformer, one of the game's biggest strengths is in its variety, as it would switch up the genre very frequently. The parts of the game where I was witnessing my partner take on a boss structured like Street Fighter, or where we were tearing through a castle using fire and ice powers like a Diablo game were my absolute favorite parts. They didn't overstay their welcome, and were always a great way to change the pace as soon as the platforming/puzzle segments started to feel dull. Both characters had ample opportunities to shine, and I didn't feel like the power-ups were skewed in favor of one character at any point. While the game's on the easier side, I still found it incredibly engaging and didn't mind the difficulty since the game was meant to be accessible to as many people as possible. The boss fights were also very fun, and never felt mindless to beat since they all had different mechanics that felt like a proper assessment of your skills with whatever tool you're using. In terms of a pure co-op experience, this is arguably as good as it gets. It's balanced, engaging, and a constant delight from start to finish. I have nothing to negative to say here.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Where the gameplay was near perfect in execution, this game's biggest weakness is its story. The game tries to foreshadow a few things, (for example: [spoiler]Moon Baboon's parting words set him up to be an interesting recurring antagonist considering the players' intentions at that point in the game[/spoiler]) but ultimately get disregarded as soon as they move on to the next setting. I also feel like the game was too lighthearted tonally, and should've leaned more into its Pixar-esque appearance by suddenly changing the tone to something heavier in order to drive home the game's themes and sticking to that tone for more than one scene. While I did like the characters, and the game was genuinely pretty funny, I thought they were the only redeeming qualities in a story that felt like an excuse to throw the players into different situations, when it had plenty of potential to expand upon its themes using player interaction. The story is funny and entertaining, but its unwillingess to take itself seriously makes it disappointingly shallow overall.

[h1]Audio[/h1]

Not much to talk about here. The voice acting wasn't particularly remarkable, and there were a handful of moments that took me out of the game, but it wasn't noticeably bad. The music is also serviceable, though I'd say it is of a higher quality than the voice acting overall, outside of the final song which I found rather underwhelming. The sound design also works well enough, though again I'd say it's nothing to write home about. Overall, it's fine, though it's nothing I'll be talking about years from now. 

[h1]Content Value[/h1]

In terms of value, I'd say it's worth it at full price just for the reason that [b]you only need to buy one copy to play with a friend.[/b] But even then, I'd still say it's worth it simply because you'll remember your time with it because of how it constantly finds ways to reinvent itself. Sure, the story isn't anything to write home about, but it's still very memorable just for how good the gameplay is. You're not going to play it more than once most likely, but it's definitely fun enough to warrant doing another playthrough with someone else if you wanted to.

[h1]Overall[/h1]

[i]It Takes Two[/i] is an absolutely amazing co-op experience with a story that holds it back from being an all-time great. But even then, the story isn't going to significantly ruin your experience because the way the gameplay constantly finds ways to keep you engaged definitely makes up for this to a degree. If you have someone to play this with, it is absolutely worth your money just to help these types of short, story-driven co-op games become more commonplace. It's not the ""perfect co-op game"", but it comes quite close. I loved my time with this game and I cannot wait to see what Hazelight does next.

It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,origin client is the absolute worst
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"This game is beautiful. The graphics are amazing. The gameplay isa alot of fun and very engaging, The puzzles are mostly very easy but still fun to solve. The Dialoges and most of the carackter cast is pretty humoures to listen to and watch.

The 2 Player integration is really well made and if you play with your girl or boy, that makes it a time well spend together, letting the hours just vanish together. Also sound design, Worldbuilding, the details all around, the levels and and and... its simply beaufifully done and deserves just the bests of praise. 

well.... for the first 6-7 hours....
then suddenly, cody and amy decide like the psychopathic parents they are, to kill their daughters most loved toy... we laughed at the insane conclusion and laughed all the way to her play room.... and then, in a VERY TWISTED way... the two still go through with their plan.. AFTER getting a hug from cutie, after cutie asked then about their feelings and wanted to help them, after chaising her, while cutie was begging for mercy, after ripping out a leg, after dragging her slowly towards a cliff slowly, after listening to her pleads for felt hours, after a needle stapped into cuties ear, pining it to the ground... well... they didnt even pull the needle out, instead they just wanted to drag cutie further, ripping also the ear off... thats there we stopped playing, my girl sad, tears dropping down the chin, after SIX HOURS of fun and laughter... well done dude! 

who ever got the idea of for this scene in that game is a psychopath, the whole game was not in this mood at all up to this point, it was all fun and games and from yet to now it changed to psychopathic torture scene...

Amy: ""i am feeling quite evil doing this..."""

It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"I don't think its an exaggeration to say this game is the best two player co-op game ever made.

Grab a friend and get this game. You won't regret it."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Play with a friend, lover or family to go trough multiple breathtaking environments and fun bosses. 
You maneuver your way trough the levels following an amazing story of a divorced couple.

I personally recommend this game."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Could be a spoiler, but doesn't really matter.










This game is about murderous couple slaying both living and humanized object just to make their one and only daughter cry.
Including mutilation of the daughter's favorite doll(living and talking) before murdering it.

Then they never looked back at their daughter until the end of the game. 

THE most psychopathic parents ever, under the brainwashing process of a Latino book who is forcing a relationship.

Very very horrible story line. Well, other than that, the storyline is intended to be heart-warming and it is.



The co-op playing experience was nice. Awesome game design too.

Easy for those who play action game regularly, a bit challenging to those who are not so familiar with aciton platformers.

If you have someone else to play with, go ahead and try it!

Play time is about ~11 hours."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,amazing and beautiful and content rich game! I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to have good time with their friend.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Awesome cooperative game. Be prepared to work together.
Through the course of the 100% we only fought once."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"If only this game had come out 15 years ago, my parents might not have divorced."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"It takes two, one of the most amazing games i've played by Hazelight Studios, i can imagine the amount of effort invested in this game, that said, investing in this game with only 30€ is a steal and you get a lot more than what's it worth. 

This game has a stunning level design, a good story line (not my cup of tea however, still very good).
Dr. Hakim appearance will trigger your anticipation as with his arrival, new game mechanics are always introduced.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
The visual design of all elements are wonderfully crafted.
The environments are imaginative and cleverly designed.

[h1] Bugs [/h1]
Only noticed one particular bug during the whole gameplay. As i was playing with friend, he was invisible on my side of the screen in the garden section.

[h1] Price [/h1]
Worth every penny.

[h1] Game time [/h1]
If all the puzzle are solved quickly then it will take about 10h during your first walkthrough. However, the average is set to 12-16h, so if you take in all the mini-games and take longer with puzzle solving.

[h1] Story [/h1]
It's pretty lovely to play with your partner, but if you're playing with your bro, it will still be pretty lovely, just consider that there's a 50% chance of you guys dating.

[h1] Grind [/h1]
From my experience, no grinding was involved.

[h1] PC requirements [/h1]
Honestly, this game is highly optimized, impressively so. So i'd say a carrot or a potato from the supermarket should get this going. All the jokes aside, check the PC requirements, they're not much.

[h1] Audience [/h1]
Honestly, i will want to point the target audience to all ages, however, i think i will be pointing it to adults, as i've never felt so bad about an elephant doll and a girls tears so much. Note: There's a whole bunch of references to other games and movies, like the lion king, a way out, Mario, +++.

[h1] Gameplay[/h1]
The variety introduced was a vital piece as it lead to the lack of repetivity in the game. So, VERY GOOD. In one game, i felt like a played soo many games.
As said, this coop game is worth EVERY PENNY.

[h1] Audio[/h1]
 Can go from good to eargasm!

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
I'd like to thank the developer and publishers for this wonderful game, the experience that was offered will most likely never be forgotten. I would like to congratulate everyone involved as this game was simple, ""AMAZING"".
Thank you very much (Except for the elephant, that wasn't cool)."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,I genuinely hope that this game sparks a snowball of co-op games supporting Friend's Pass. Wife and I loved playing this together.

It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,Literally the best Co-op experience I've had. It Takes Two is a MASTERPIECE of story telling and game design. It keeps the player focused and interested by always introducing new gameplay mechanics that never overstay their welcome but sometimes never stay as long as you like. The Mini games encourage the players to explore the environments which are stunning in their own right. Cody and May are very well voiced and come off as real people. I promise you this game will not let you down.

(Heavy spoiler alert.)

It Takes Two is a cooperative split-screen tale by the same developers who gave you A Way Out, a game about two prison escapees that I can also recommend. Luckily, It Takes Two comes with a free friend's pass; which means that only one person has to purchase a copy of the game. The adventure delivers a story beginning that most of us have come to know either now or during childhood, given the 40-50% current divorce rate in America: one of two parents in a struggling marriage. The narrative is directed by the child's whims, which are simply for her parents to stop fighting, work out their issues, and eventually get back together. The child's teary anguish then puts her father & mother through a spell that relinquishes their humanity and turns the couple into wooden and clay dolls. 

The game is enticing for several reasons; those being the fact that game experiences can a lot of the times be better enjoyed with friends or family, plus, I'm sure more than a couple of us have had wistful desires for our parents to reunite after witnessing constant fighting and the lengthy processes of divorce and custody battles themselves. In this game, you can finally fix that impossible issue. You and your friend take on the roles of May & Cody, the parents of your daughter named Rose, and you suddenly appear in your backyard shed, with much smaller perspectives than before; coming to the realization that you both have shrunk to inhuman sizes. This epiphany is followed by a hysterical freakout from the two, and then the plan of getting out of this situation and back into your regular bodies. 

The very first level introduces your first meeting with Dr. Hakim, a.k.a. the Book of Love, who becomes the main driving force behind mending the broken relationship, although all May & Cody are preoccupied with is returning to your original forms. By now, you and whoever you're playing with have to now learn to work together both efficiently and concurrently to take on the challenges, optional minigames, and eventual boss fights of each level, this one being about navigating through your abandoned shed and defeating your old vacuum cleaner & toolbox. You then learn that all of the inanimate objects in your house are actually sentient living beings, capable of having thoughts and feelings of their own; which leads you to discover that the aforementioned vacuum cleaner is upset about being replaced by a newer version of themself, and is now taking revenge upon both of you. You then comb through the dusty ant-infested corners of your forgotten shed, learning to put forth coincided efforts for traversing through each menial challenge with whatever new objects or weapons you're given (this time being a hammerhead and a nail shooter), finally coming to the conclusion: defeating the divided section's boss levels. 

The next chapter takes you to the tree in your front yard, tasking you with becoming military operatives for the squirrels, who are in an ongoing feud with the wasps. May is given a bazooka and Cody receives a sap gun, and when both weapons are combined, you have the ability to make things explode, which is how you're expected to defeat the wasps. I'm sure all of us at one point have wanted to commit genocide against pesky bugs, and this section allows you to do just that. Even though every chapter has similar elements, there are always new and imaginative ways to go about proceeding with your missions.  Each area, whether it be the shed, pillow fort, literal cosmos, or your child's room; is made with tons of presumed care & thought, not only with the beautiful and sometimes nearly photorealistic graphics but also the unique level design and clever mechanics of helping each other triumph through. Nothing ever feels overdone, & you're given ample opportunities to just release stress and have fun whether that be through sliding on massive slides, steering airplane maneuvers, sailing through seemingly ""treacherous"" waters, riding on hallucinogenic catfish, rhinoceros beetles, fluffy bees, frogs, dinosaurs, and just about anything else you can possibly imagine. In addition to this, the game is also littered with amusing references to both Hazelight's previous games and other things like Street Fighter & Dungeons & Dragons, for example. 

The third segment contains your journey through Rose's room, which has you reliving childhood dreams by passing through a colorful pillow fort and ultimately flying to space to fight an astronaut baboon. The controls often invert depending on what you're currently doing, but luckily this circumstance, nor any of the puzzles or boss fights ever feel too bewildering or impossible to figure out, especially when you have the essence of collaborative teamwork. The only thing I'd really warn you of is the possibly seizure-inducing kaleidoscope part, but the difficulty remains intriguingly challenging whilst at the same time manageable. 

After your stint on the messy floors of Rose's room, you're invited to the castle to unleash your depraved plan of kidnapping and murdering Cutie the Elephant, who is the queen of the stronghold. The ulterior motive here is to make your daughter cry, which the two parents assume is the way of potentially undoing the spell placed upon them. The environment is always enjoyable to interact with, but the carrying out of the actual goal gives you a lingering feeling of brutality, considering the fact that you're literally tearing the sweetly pleasant child's toy limb by limb while it is alive, which can be slightly uncomfortable. When this evil plan fails to succeed, Dr. Hakim returns to harass you (which he does basically throughout the entire game) by forcing the couple to make it through three challenges, the main themes being collaboration, attraction, & passion.

The first part, collaboration, brings you to the guttural insides of your household wooden clock; which incorporates a Victorian era, Steampunk esque village, farmlands, and the only actually difficult area in the game (a platforming puzzle aptly named Hell tower.) When you finish this place, the next segment shrinks you even smaller to the correct size for being inside a snow globe. You then trudge through arctic depths whereas you swim in extremely deep waters equaling only the Mariana Trench itself, which I'd say for people with thalassophobia to take caution in only because of the creepy sea creatures that live below. But this level isn't all impending doom, you're also able to explore the lively and adorable holiday village where Cody first proposed to May. 

After freezing through the ice and snow, the last area of the game guides you to your family garden. Cody is equipped with some newfound innate ability to transform into different plants, and May is given a water hose. The goal here is all about passion, and it is mainly expressed by the couple helping each other with things they both love to do because they failed to do so beforehand, both only caring to focus on work and maintaining the household. By the end of the level, Dr. Hakim believes that the couple has appropriately reconciled to at least the point of remaining friends, and gives them back their regular human bodies, but simultaneously; their daughter Rose has begun to believe that the fault of the divorce belongs with her. The two parents come together to collect Rose from a bus stop after she has run away, and the game ends. 

Overall, the game takes about 16 hours to complete and it is appropriate for any situation, whether that be two friends undergoing an entertaining encounter together, or a broken couple looking for a profound experience full of metaphorical reasoning to stay together. It Takes Two deserves the outpour of overwhelmingly positive reviews, and it truly builds on A Way Out's strengths. 10/10."

Story: I got attached to the story very quickly. 
Difficulty: It takes two is not a difficult game, but if you and your friend don't cooperate the game will be hard and difficult.
Soundtrack : the soundtrack was good but not Uncharted level soundtracks.
Playtime: if you really get attached, you finish this games in a day or two.
Game play: I got a and hand of the controls really fast.
i highly recommend this game.

It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,The book is a complete piece of shit and I love him.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,parents  splitting up then  kid wish them become friends again then a Spanish book comes  life and put them through challenges to rekindle their love. p.s. they turn you into a marketable plant.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"was a fun little experience, wholesome at times, funny at times, gorgeous and beautiful at all times
its a good game, was relaxing and enjoyable and worth the price
my partners comment: beautiful story altough the adults (cody and may) are bad parents, graphic and scenes are breath-taking, you notice immediatly that the devs put alot of work and consideration into everything, every bit and detail"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"This was by far one of the better games I've played over the past couple of years. Can warmly recommend this, to anyone who wants a good Co-op experience!"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,Likely one of the most enjoyment I have had in a while. I would recommend playing it with the same person throughout the entire game. The music is amazing and I love the original gameplay each chapter has. 10/10 for me
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Great game, played it with a friend in steam remote play and had little to no delay while going through. Story is good, the main characters are a little unlikable but they grow on you. The controls are very tight and its a great puzzle platformer with intuitive puzzles that rely on teamwork."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,beetle :(
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"The best two player coop experience since Portal 2.

However, the protagonists are the worst. They don't deserve their daughter. It's easily the worst part of the game."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,MUST PLAY w/ ur SOULMATE!!!!!!
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,An absolutely incredible game that checks all the boxes. Do yourself (and a friend) a favor and buy this game immediately.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"top tier gameplay

"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"A beautiful cooperative puzzle/platformer experience, beaten in roughly 13 hours, with generous exploration. The game explores several game style genres throughout the campaign, as it gifts you both a unique power each level that synergize with each other. It controls surprisingly well throughout the entire game, and it even explores several vehicle segments, that again, all feel relatively well handled. Following the game's two protagonists is very entertaining, listening to their squabbles and dialogue enrich their characters, to the point where I begin to connect with them through their journey to reconnect. I personally played this with my partner, and I would recommend it played this way for sure, it feels more connectable. Though playing with friends would be just as fine, as again, it is a solid A+ puzzle/platformer."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Probably the best game to play with your SO. It was a wonderful experience all the way through

Except the Castle section. The conclusion to that shit made me wanna quit the game."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"One of the best games to release this year, it is addictive, fun, and brings you and your partner/friend closer together in a shared desire to kill a book and in the guilt you share over that poor elephant. 9.7/10"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,Absolutely amazing game. I loved every second of it!
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,wasnt married but told me friend we are getting a divorce. Great game though
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,Played this game with my wife now we're gay.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,When you think the game is over and it couldn't get any better... it gets better
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Very Tentative recommendation. 

This game is fun, and my wife and I had a great time. HOWEVER, if you guys fight a lot or have a tense relationship, this will make it much worse. there's a lot of depending on each other and one of you will be better than the other. 

But if you're in a good place, PLEASE, try this game. Pretty fun."

It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Played this with my Girlfriend, lots of fun until my wife caught us, 10/10."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"A really interesting, well thought out co-op game. Each chapter is fresh and exciting, with massively different settings and worlds each one as charming as the last, with references and Easter eggs strewn about everywhere. The puzzles are mixed up constantly so nothing feels repetitive, yet they remain thought-provoking and enjoyable to complete. The action set pieces are great, one mission you'll be flying a plane made out of underpants, the next you'll be battling toy knights as a wizard. 

Overall, I can feel that a lot of love went into this game, and if you have someone to play this with, I would highly recommend it."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Game of the year so far. So fun, always something new each round"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,Great game! One of the most fun games I've played in the recent years!
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Game not playable due to EA/Origin. Telling me I have no friends online on Origin when I try to invite, also telling me I have zero friends added all at despite other EA titles allowing me to invite off my Origin friends list. Inconsistent and frustrating.

Game is fun from what I've seen others play but not worth wasting your money when it's a coin toss being able to play."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Amazing game. Excellent story telling, unique levels and fantastic synergy that forces you and your partner to work together to progress. Topped off with great humour, memorable moments and lots of easter eggs, I can strongly recommend this game."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"The definitive coop game. There is nothing like it. Every minute is made of pure creativity, designed to bring you joy and excitement, in a whirlwind of innovative mechanics and well-crafted puzzles. 
PS: make sure to search for and play all the mini-games. Some of them are brilliant and could take up hours."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Great Game, Great Story."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Best ARPG I've played in years
.

Story is also good but its really about the ARPG part"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Highly addictive, but easy to just play for an hour at a time and still feel accomplished. Easily digestible in bite-sized chunks, or binged all at once. Lots of co-op fun, with minigames for those with a competitive streak. The characters are, of course, rather annoying, but the game play is SO much fun. So many different mechanics that never seem complicated, hard to understand, or annoying."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,If only Marriage problems could be solved like this !
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Fun platfmoring / light puzzle game for couch or online coop. would recommend if you like shouting at a anthropomorphised book with a slightly racist accent

oh and there are squirrels"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Fun, inclusive, anti-normative, gender role reversing, slightly racist, weridly and at times uncomfortably sexualized,  ridiculously content filled co-op game about a schizophrenic girl that will instantly make any divorce child relive their childhood drama. Created, presumably, by heavy drugs users.
Involves elements of torture, kidnapping, hostage taking and competetive mini-gaming."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"I've been without a real co-op game for too long

This is absolutely stellar"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"+ lots of content
+ very good visual

- oh dear, the narration \ character speech is so stupid, sometimes I have to remove the headset
- the characters sometimes acting inconsistent. Once want to kill an elephant who begging for her life and screaming, 5 minutes later they have bad feeling about some stationary pigs who carried into the butchery
- the game is overhelping, and the characters shouting what has to be done, even before you would have time to look around in the room. No help hint settings. 
- the third party access is painful, the origin client is painful, you update steam, update origin, update the game, oh boy

Altogether it's a very good game, it's stunning how much visual design work is in it, and how much you can explore\discover even outside of the main quests. There are lots of things to jump to, hang on, look for - if your game partner lets you to.
But the characters are so painful, I wish there were an option to silence them, or turn off the roleplaying, or whatever."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"I still see people playing this sometimes. You serious? You haven't beat this game yet? 
This was a day one buy for me and my friend. We beat it so quick; world record pace while still enjoying the intricate details of the world and all of the awesome mini-games. Haven't seen anyone beat our time since. Some people are still stuck on the vacuum level and others which I won't mention to avoid spoilers.
It Takes Two 2 is one of my most anticipated games. Can't wait."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"i like this one 
"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Played this with my wife.  This game is great, and most certainly one of the best, most in-depth co-op game I've ever played.  Rich story, fun mechanics, just a great time.  I've been on steam for many years.  This is the first review I've ever written."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,This is by far thee most fun game I have every played with a homie. This game has all sorts different gameplay types and mechanics that always keeps you on the edge of your seat. Best $40 I spent on a co-op game.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,Great for me and my wife. She is not even a gamer.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"This game is amazing. It's so fun, bonding and beautiful visually. I haven't even finished yet but I'm too eager to let other people know that it's 10/10"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,Fun to play with a friend. Love how each chapter has different tools to use. Just wish it wasn't such a big game. I plan on uninstalling after I complete the game to free up some room on my pc.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,I like it so much. Me and my family had so much fun with this game.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,very innovative game indeed!
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,My sister and I played through and became better siblings and would do it over a billion times again.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Most people have already said what I intend to say about this game.

It isn't the hardest or most complex game in the world. What it does have though, is an insane amount of heart poured into it. It is one of the best co-op experiences you can possible have. A true 10/10."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"It Takes Two is a beautiful coop masterpiece. It will be hard for me to find any other coop games better or even as good as this. Every chapter you get a new tool/skill to play with, the surprise is never-ending. The story line is also lovely (I cried at the end). Both my husband and I loved every part of the game! We can feel the effort of the developers put into creating this game while playing. Definitely worth every dollar and cent!"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"It Takes Two has gotten a lot of recognition and very positive feedback and reviews. But let me tell you something about this game. This game is way better than you will think. Going in I knew it would be good but I didn't know it would be this great. I got this game mainly to play with my gf and so far we have had a blast playing it. It's definitely one of our favorite games now and from start to finish it brings nothing but joy and laughter throughout the entire journey. We have shared so many laughs and since we can even see each other's pov it brings lots of joy watching your partner fail something so easy. The mini-games are just purely fun and enjoyable to play and to be competitive with. We haven't finished the game just yet but we definitely will. Overall this game is phenomenal down to its core. It feels like a new fresh game, the visuals are beautiful and colorful, and laughs are guaranteed. It Takes Two will definitely create great fun memories and also brings back a certain nostalgic feel to you. 

100/10!"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Cute, creative gameplay! Does require you to have an Origin account in order to launch the game, but that wasn't a problem for me as I already have one. The cinematic nature of the game is beautiful, and the different cooperative puzzles are clever and original. Haven't finished it yet but my partner and I both love it and are having lots of fun exploring together!"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,Am I the only one found the little girl creepy :/
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Would really recommend this game if your are in a failing relationship with your loved one.

A 10/10 co-op masterpiece. Hazelight really up'd themselves with It Takes Two from their previous co-op game A Way Out. I never had a dull moment in this game and always have had a smile on my face during my playtime. I can't wait to see what their next game will be. They've had my curiosity and they now have my full undivided attention.

Fuck the oscars btw"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"One of the most beautiful & creative games I've ever played.

Highly recommend."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Me and my friend loved everything about this game, form the story to the puzzles and the design. I would highly recommend this game. 10/10 would very much so play again and 10/10 cry again at ending."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"For when your girlfriend thinks you play too many fps, play that with her."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,Fantastic Coop game!! Best I've Played
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,swag game
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"This is just great in every aspect, if  you don't want to play this just because of Origin you will for sure miss out on some really good mechanics and overall gameplay.

Absolutely Gorgeous!"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"I was actually the friend's pass experience, the first time I played it, and i did like it a lot. 
I did 2 Playthrough (yes I bought the game after the first time), played both characters to try everything out and it feels like I haven't seen everything. There's so much to explore (good easter eggs), so many mini games. Different mechanics ever scene - It's like you have a lot of your favorite games mechanics in one game.
The split screen it was a issue for me at first (wasn't really feeling it) but it actually helps a lot. - Haven't played split screen games in a W H I L E.
Music is amazing, story amazing. Worth every dollar.

[b]10/10 - Probably will play 3rd time."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,rlly good.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"This game is really good and enjoyable co op but the narrative really... thew myself and my partner off. The characters are terrible people, divorce aside. They throw their kid under the bus so many times then at the end and say ""noo we didn't hate you we just had issues between ourselves"". Everyone in the game needs therapy especially after the end. 

[spoiler] when the kid at the end walks to the bus stop my partner and i both came to the conclusion that rose should go to child protective services and not home with her parents [spoiler] 
"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"It Takes Two is definitely worth the money, and will provide hours of entertainment =)"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,One of the best co-op games I've ever played and finished the game in 13 hrs with my bf haha. I definitely recommend playing!! I never paid this much money for a game and I found it very worth it.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,Very fun game.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"I finished this game with a friend of mine and I can only highly recommend it, it is one of the best game I ever played. The musics, the gameplay (that never gets boring because it changes at every levels), the graphics are just astounding and the team that developed it should be very proud for this piece of art."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Probably my game of the year. 

So much creativity and a breath of fresh air for the co-op genre. You only need one copy of the game for two people to play it remotely which is rarely seen.

9/10. Loses a point for giving me PTSD. You'll know what I mean if you've played enough of it."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"best co up game i ever seen on my life 



and if you complete the game try a way out"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,This is the most greatest game have ever play
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,This is the best game I've ever played! Worth every penny! The developers must've worked for YEARS to develop such an amazing experience with no bugs! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! WE NEED ANOTHER ONE LIKE THIS ONE!
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Amazing game!
Design, Gameplay, Story, just about everything in there is great and it doesn't even force both players to buy the game!
Can't recommend enough"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"masterful, brilliant, & creative. rly amazing experience. cutie deserved better."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,the worst flaw of this game is that it ends.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"It really does take two persons
"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,Literally the most gorgeous game I ever had the opportunity to play through. It contained such smooth transitions and wonderful dialogue. I never felt like there was a major dull moment! It entirely helped because of who i played with as well! We had a wonderful time together and enjoyed every bit of it just bouncing back and forth off each others energy in every scene. Definitely recommend getting this game if you want to enjoy a touching story and wonderful game play! couldn't recommend this game any higher ~! 10/10 where is It Takes THREE??
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"A fun, engaging, story driven game perfect for couples. It has beautiful graphics, witty dialogue, and a great variety of gameplay that is just challenging enough to keep you on your toes while still being a casual game to enjoy with a partner. My girlfriend and I love this game."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"We have finished the game in about 12 hours. Every minute was a different joy.
Puzzles start easy and gets a bit harder but nothing that you two cannot solve. Novice players that hasn't used a WASD before may have some troubles. It looks like it's casual-player-friendly but it's not. Both players has to have a tiny bit of video game experience. You wont be able to play it with your grandma for example.
Also, there's no replayability unless you change your girlfriend/boyfriend and play with the new one haha :)

Just kidding, buy the game already."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"When I got this for me and my friend to play I knew nothing about it. I thought it would be a quick 3 hour or so time waster that would give us something to do.

Instead what we got was 13 hours of pure hilarious fun and enjoyment.

This game is a masterpiece. Everything from the character development to the level design to the easter eggs from other games was absolutely fantastic.

We laughed and cursed while doing stupid shit to each other like in Portal 2. 10/10

The entire story was wonderful from beginning to end .... 10/10

The mini games were a nice break from the story to sit and do something odd and eventful. 10/10

The animations, music, levels, puzzles, and chapter arcs were fantastically made. 10/10

One thing I was really surprised by was there was very little to no bugs that we ran into. 10/10

I am so glad that I ran across this game. I would be willing to play through the entire thing again and again with every one of my friends who wants to play it and I would buy them the whole game as well instead of using the ""friend pass"" just so I could keep supporting the developers. 

This was an amazing ride from start to finish. We loved every single part of this game (except one sad part ...you'll know it when you get to it... we still feel horrible).

I have one question for the developers though ....... WHERE IS THE FAMILY DOG..... I MUST KNOW WHERE THE GOOD LOOKING DOGGO IS FROM THE VIEWER PICTURES. 

Overall this game is amazing and everyone should definitely give it a try. You wont regret it at all."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Amazing storytelling, fantastic and creative use of art / assets and 'being small in a large world'. This game impressed me and the lady all the way to the credits.

The parents are a bit cringey and dare I say, 'horrible parents' in general, but man this title is definitely one of the best coop puzzler platformers I've played.

The coop gameplay never stagnates as you are constantly changing roles and scenery throughout.

Pick this one up! With the Friend Pass, you don't even have to buy a copy for your partner!
Enjoy!"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"A good friend of mine recommended this game to my wife and me. Not really sure what I was expecting... But it was amazing. The story, characters, scenery, and gameplay overall keeps you so entertained. Every chapter has a different way to play and there's always fun little minigames or things to interact with in the world. My wife ended up crying for the last 5 mins of the game xD 

The book is my fav character for sure. COLLA-BORATION!!"

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,"One of my favourite games, if not my most favourite, and it has been for years. I love the open world, the freedom you have while playing, the lore behind Tamriel and the races, the detail put into the game. Combine that with the amazing modding community, and the tools freely given to you to mod it yourself, the game is full of endless fun - whether you're into lore and roleplay, quests and adventure, or modding the ever loving fuck out of a game and breaking it, Skyrim has it all."
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,"Instead of going into the reasons that make Skyrim so good (which, lets be real you already know because its f*cking SKYRIM!)
I'll tell you my Skyrim story..

So I downloaded and started playing the pirated copy of Skyrim on my old potato pc long ago, after about a dozen hours or so I was completely hooked and fell in love with the game. Something about Skyrim just clicked with me and I kinda felt guilty playing it for free. That day I uninstalled Skyrim and made a promise to myself that when I get a good PC and some money, I'll buy the game and continue my journey.

Time passed by and I got a new PC so I finally decided to buy Skyrim.. and I'll be damned, the magic is still there. I finished the campaign after getting side tracked like a million times and loved every second of it. It still feels like there's so much more to do and explore. It truly is something special and it holds a special place in my heart.

P.S: please don't f*ck up TES 6 Todd, please I beg you!"

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,"I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee.


Now I am an adventurer with an arrow sticking out of my knee."
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,"In short, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim captures so many of the finest gaming experiences I've ever had.  So much so...that it's my favorite video game of all time.  Why?  

<big inhale>

So I've been a gamer since the Atari 2600 days and have always been fascinated with those 'senses of wonder' video games typically offer.  Perhaps its because of the addictive nature of sheer discovery as we press ever deeper into what a game has on tap.  I'm not necessarily into fast-twitch types of games, mind you (except for the original Marble Madness...that was ahead of its time), but deep story-driven games that give you freedom to role-play without tons of linearity are my ultimate cup of tea.  I'm an exploration nut, so I really love to go wherever I want to, whenever I want to, and however I want to...simply to seek out spots where it [i]feels[/i] like I'm just not supposed to be there and be rewarded for it.  The first game ever for me that offered up that kind of experience was the original Legend of Zelda on NES.  When I opened that well-earned (savings from cutting people's grass) golden cartridge for the first time, I had no idea what I was in for (there was no YouTube or anything like that...only word of mouth from friends who either had it or had read about it in Nintendo Power magazine).  For that game, I had neither.  I went into it [b]cold[/b].  And it was amazing.

Fast forward significantly from there, and I've mowed through so many great gaming experiences that are just too many to recount.  But...with all those great gaming moments I so thoroughly enjoyed...in the back of my mind, none had compared to the magnitude of grandeur that the Legend Of Zelda (and its subsequent follow-ups up through Ocarina of Time) gave me.  For me, those were true pinnacles for an exploration nut like me.  However, I noticed that though I did enjoy Ocarina of Time a lot, it felt like the franchise wasn't aging with me (becoming too 'kiddy"" for lack of a better term).  In other words, it was clearly targeted to a younger age group than that of my own.  My outlook changed, and I realized then that perhaps what I loved about the series was based primarily on the nostalgia I tried to keep internally encapsulated.  The series went another direction, leaving me bittersweetly behind.  I wasn't mad about it...just accepting of the fact that the magic I enjoyed of those games was becoming more distant.  And no, I didn't become full of woeful anguish, jamming R.E.M.'s ""Losing My Religion"" and all that.

So around May of 2012, a work colleague of mine and I began to talk about our respective plans for the soon-approaching weekend just before parting ways.  In that conversation, I asked him, ""So what are you guys doing this weekend?""  I'll never forget his answer; ""I am going to get a bucket of KFC and some Mountain Dew, strip down to my boxers for the entire weekend, fart, and play 'Sskyrim.'""  I laughed my ass off and was taken aback [b]quite[/b], then I responded with, ""Sounds like a firm plan you've got there, and might I ask what the hell 'Sskyrim' is...is that a video game?""  He said,""Oh yeah...it's THE video game.""  You may be laughing, but during this particular time, you can indeed say I was living under a rock to not know about Skyrim (even Elder Scrolls in general...I know), and you'd be right to say so.  Anyway, I started asking about what was so good about this 'Sskyrim' to warrant this interesting resolve for the weekend that completely seemed to give no purchase to any other potential plans.  So then he started telling me about it...followed by me asking more questions, as my interest was admittedly and increasingly piqued.  He then began to pull up some videos on his phone, showing me the first moments of the game's intro.  I was floored by 'this-game-I've-never-heard-of's' opener.  The setup in that short teaser had me ready to go buy this game at that moment from the nearby Wal-Mart, but not before my work colleague described to me his first account of stepping out into the land of Skyrim from the dark breaches of Helgen Keep, as that Skyrim sun bathed his weary eyes, having so nearly succumbed to the darknesses just endured, in a golden splendor.  I was sold.  Period.

Enter The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim...

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,"INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE
Introduction

1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.

3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.

4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.

5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important."

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,"Hey, you. You're finally awake.
You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell. You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief. Shut up back there! And what's wrong with him, huh? Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King. Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they've captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us? I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits. No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening. Hey, what village are you from, horse thief? Why do you care? A Nord's last thoughts should be of home. Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.

...looks like the Thalmor are with him.

General Tullius, sir. The headsman is waiting. Good. Let's get this over with! Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me. Look at him. General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.

Why are we stopping? Why do you think? End of the line. Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us."

It's a whole new world !!! Immerse yourself in it. It's worth a buy.
"
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,"It's good, the only issue is it's just Skyrim again, if you've played it already then it's obviously not gonna be anything new. I'd suggest doing a completely different character this time. Focus on a set of skills you've never really done before. Maybe add some roleplaying to your character: give them a set of core motivations and have those influence the choices you make in-game. Maybe create some arbitrary rules you have to follow, like have your character who's a vegetarian and never eats meat, or make a character that cares about fashion and only wears nice clothing, even in battle. Like I said, it's the same game you've already played, so get creative and do stuff you've never done before."
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,I have actually played this game for some decades. It is my favorite game. It has been with me through several computer systems. oh and I have bought this game more times than I have had computers.

I have this game on so many consoles, I have lost track of where I am up to. I have 20 characters going at once. MODS TO BOOT. 

IT IS HOURS OF NONSTOP PAIN, FRUSTRATION AND PURE ENJOYMENT!

I find it heart warming to come home to a family I have somehow come to have????? Where did the pet rat come from????

There is never a dull moment, and even after all these years I can play it again and again. Feel the same excitement I felt when I first laid eyes on the beautiful land abounds in snow and trees and those freaking ice wraiths (WTF I HATE THEM SO MUCH).

I can look past all the bugs and glitches and with all my heart say ""Yes. I love Skyrim. See you all in Sovengarde <3 """

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,"I keep coming back to Skyrim, but it's been a long, long time since I last sat in the carriage headed for execution or even played as a character that was ""dragonborn"". 

Mods are the real game of playing The Elder Scrolls. That has been the way since Morrowind, and it's still true for Skyrim in 2021. I spend hours finding, patching and building mods - and spend little time actually playing the game, besides making sure it looks and feels beautiful without crashing or other immersion breaking problems. And when it all comes together, it's an unparalleled playing experience allowing for moments in gaming that can't be had anywhere else.

Make it your own, and enjoy getting lost in a great game made absolutely unforgettable by its modding community."
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,"I've bought this game on PS4 numerous times and also just recently on PC. In total, I have easily accumulated hundreds and hundreds of hours on this game, perhaps in the thousands. Even so, I still have not grown tired of such a beautiful game even to this day. This is by far one of the greatest games in history, in my eyes, and will forever be one of my top favorites. Character customization and race selection, endless adventures with a huge world, random scenarios, intense battles, crafting and magic. It has it all for fantasy lovers."

The devs basically took a shit and released it multiple times with the same amount if not more bugs. Basically, imagine taking a shit, putting it in a microwave, taking it out, realizing it isn't hot enough, then putting it back in for another minute, then taking it out and eating it. The devs this all the microwaving, and now you are being forced to shove this piece of shit down your throat. Thats what playing this game feels like. 10/10 would recommend."

Human: Fall Flat,Adventure,477160,Honestly this game is pretty fun with friends. Throwing each other and messing around with the floppy bodies this game has makes it entertaining.
Human: Fall Flat,Adventure,477160,"""Human: Fall Flat"" is a well-done, fun game.  It's especially fun when played co-op (watching your friends thrash around is hilarious).  My complaints about it are minor:

- Even though the game is predicated on moving floppy bodies around with loose controls, many of the optional paths, areas or Achievements need fairly tight control.  In general, though, because of the ensuing hilarity, this is fine.

- The ability to climb walls would be nice.  From what I've read, this was removed from the game for being overpowered.  Looking at a lot of the speedrun videos on YouTube, I've got to agree with that.  But, having the ability to just use our chins or something to edge us up that last inch or two of a slightly botched jump would be great.

- I don't know if this was a generic connection issue or something with the game, but in co-op, we experienced quite a few momentary freezes.  It's more than a stutter.  The game appears to just stop for 5 or so seconds at a time.  Unfortunately, when it happens, things are still  happening in the game and when things un-freeze, you can find yourself in a less than stellar situation.

And that's pretty much it.  Just a few minor issues with a great game.  It took me 46.7 hours to complete it with 100% Achievements (though that was with a lot of repeat co-op play -- a more focused approach would be significantly faster).  So, it's worth it even at its list price of nearly $20 (though it historically goes on sale for between $6 and $7.50 quite often).  Recommended."

The first night I played, it was with my friend James, and to be honest, we played for 8 hours straight, until the early morning birds were chirping outside my window. There's something mystical and dreamlike about being inside these worlds. There's nothing crazy and mind blowing in terms of what you're literally doing in the game, but it has a way of keeping you entertained for hours. Messing around with the physics and trying to find ""secret"" areas is fun enough. Enjoy!"

Half-Life,Adventure,70,"[h1] An experiment that cost humanity everything[/h1]
[b]Half-Life[/b] is one of the best games ever made by man. A game with a huge universe, which is much deeper than it might seem at first glance. This is not just a shooter. And this is not just a story about one late-come scientist wearing distinctive glasses. The Black Mesa incident is just a prelude to what humanity will have to face in a matter of days. And Gordon's journey through the entire complex is just one of many destinies that are being decided right here and now. And Freeman is clearly not the kind of person who gives up in the erupting nightmare, where your next step can be the last. And the story of Gordon Freeman is an example that there are no impassable obstacles, no matter how insurmountable they seemed. A simple scientist with a crowbar in his hands and wearing an H.E.V 4th model protective suit with a basic military expertise. What this particular person could achieve by the end of this longest day of his life? But he achieved a lot. He survived in this seething hell from unseen before aliens and exactly the same people but in a soldier's uniform, who came here with one goal - to clear the complex. Literally. Including him. Against the background of Gordon's survival, we see the fate of other people - not only the same scientists, security officers, but also the soldiers, the very ones who came to ""cleanse"" us. Half-Life is, first of all, the tragic story of the fate of many hundreds of people who became the first, but far from the last victims of this criminal experiment, whose result was known for a long time to that very man in a business suit and administrator Breen. In 48 hours the history of the complex will come to an end. Towards the end, which will be the beginning of an even greater nightmare that will befall the entire planet and its population. Most of the Black Mesa personnel will die, as will many of those who were sent to clean it up. But those who survive will devote the rest of their lives to trying to turn things around. After all, from the waste of Portal Storms, a force will come, which will open a new chapter in the history of the Earth. The darkest and bloodiest."
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"Half-Life is definitely a game-changing FPS, inspired by the classics but also genre-breaking. The levels are linear but it follows a coherent story, there's puzzles to solve outside of the shooting - sometimes optional to get some ammos and/or health but usually they are actually needed to continue onto the next area or level!

So gameplay-wise it's your standard FPS. You have a full set of various weapons - everything from a regular 9mm to an RPG. There's also some experimental weapons you get later on. The enemies are... I'd say kinda hard. Health is generated by either health packs or health stations, so no re-gen here. Ammo are in certain areas scarce and there's several enemy types that are bullet sponges, especially later on in the game.

Has it aged well? I don't know, it's playable but at the same time it's quite rough around the edges. Perhaps Black Mesa is the better version these days?

It's overall good tho and I had a fun time with it, although I do have to admit that in certain areas... I had to ""turn off"" my health. It was a bit too hard for my taste otherwise and I had no real interest in re-playing certain areas over and over."

Half-Life,Adventure,70,"It's a little bit of an obscure indie title but it's a good first start for a new company. Excited to see what this ""Valve"" company does next I'm sure it'll be huge!"
Half-Life,Adventure,70,very nice

Half-Life,Adventure,70,It's Half Life what more do you want?
Half-Life,Adventure,70,better than the sequels
Half-Life,Adventure,70,It good
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"OK, Half Life is from 1998, so it's pretty old - I'll try to keep that in mind when writing this review.

It's not brilliant, I'll be honest. The sound design is the same loop and when other sounds are playing,it becomes a horrible cacophony of noise. If you like tinnitus - this is perfect for you. 

The graphics are old, yet very good even today. They really do set the mood of the whole game. The enemy design is also brilliant, every enemy is very different from the other and so you always have to learn how to counter every new enemy. 

In combat, things fall apart. You are always the weaker enemy, which is partly the point, and bullets are scarce so really count if you don't want to take loads of damage. Combat is, however, the dominant feature, and you have to fight endless enemies that you have already met. It becomes almost a chore towards the end of the game, and it spoiled the experience for me. 

Half Life is a long game. It took me about 15 hours to beat the game on my first playthrough (on normal difficulty). At times there were long parts (one up to 2 hours) that felt like fillers and that didn't need to be there. There were puzzles that gave you no help to solve so you're stuck trying to solve the puzzle until you randomly get to the answer. 

It's not the best game ever, it's old and I got really motion sick at times. The thing that made this game enjoyable for me is the moments that aren't bad. If you stick with the game, there's so much it does right and these moments really make the game enjoyable and massively outweigh the negatives in Half Life.

Overall, I'd probably give this game a 5/10 - not the best, but not by far the worst I've ever played either."
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"I've got so many great memories with this game. I think I'm gonna be playing this for a long time to come. Crossfire feels like home.
Hope Valve updates their VAC to stop aimbot users from ruining an otherwise timeless DM multiplayer."
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"Now if you have the choice between Black Mesa and Half-Life definitely choose Black Mesa as it is a more modern remastered version of this game that fixes most the bugs. Half-Life isn't a bad game by any means  and is still a great game to this day however in my opinion it hasn't aged that well with it's slippery physics, enemy placement, damage dealt vs damage received, bland soundtrack, etc. I will say that if you want to check out some gaming history this is a great game to play but if you just want to have great time while playing the first chapter of Gordon Freeman's adventure then I would heavily advise choosing Black Mesa."
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"Despite still being old, it's such a good game. The existence of this proves you don't need good or realistic visuals to have the time of your life."
Half-Life,Adventure,70,i hate this game
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"Shit i wasnt a half life fan at all until i got half life 2, then half life 1, honestly the most fun I've had since i got my first vr headset. 10/10 great game, dont get the source edition."

Half-Life,Adventure,70,"Never had a PC, let alone a gaming PC, before now and the hype around these games lives up to everything! If you are looking for something a little bit more ""modern"" then look into Half life Black Mesa as it is a community re-build of this classic. However if you are looking to play the original in all its glory then look no further! A fantastic entry into a fantastic franchise."
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"one of the best fps i played to date, not only a run and gun but using strategies to win. and the world is very well made but with very dated graphics if you mind that. i don't personally."
Half-Life,Adventure,70,better than hl2
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"You Don't Need Good Graphics To Have A Masterpiece of a game
Still holds up so buy it
Or buy its remaster black mesa"
Half-Life,Adventure,70,Do you know who ate all the donuts?
Half-Life,Adventure,70,Good game. Genuine scares everywhere
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"Half-Life is one of the most timeless PC games of the 20th century, at least gameplay-wise.
The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a 27 year old therotical physicist who works at a mysterious scientific research facility called ""Black Mesa"", located deep within New Mexico's rocky underground areas. The game starts with a monorail ride that gives the player a look at the ambience. The soundtrack that plays during said ride gives chills up the spine and feeling of dread to any first-timer. After finishing the sequence, the player arrives at Sector C, where they have to start rushing toward the testing chamber, not before getting a Mark IV HEV Suit to put on as a security measure.

I won't spoil much of the rest, and I don't want to make the review a 20 page long explanation of the lore, so I'll get to the technical and gameplay side of the game. First off, you may have noticed the visuals are a bit rough. This is usually something most players can get over quickly, as with any other old-school 3D first-person shooter. 

However, if you really think the graphics are affecting your experience, but you're still eager to play it, you may also try Half-Life: Source, an official Valve port of the game to Half-Life 2's signature engine, Source, or you could also play Black Mesa, a full-on remake of the original game on a brand-new engine that not only massively improves its outdated visuals, but also has some gameplay changes and expansion of certain chapters and maps. 

Anyway, getting back on topic, Half Life seriously made the entire gaming industry rethink the purpose and possibilities of a story-driven FPS title. After all, shooters back then were thought to be short, fun and chaotic experiences, like Wolfenstein and DOOM. Half Life however, while still keeping gunplay a priority, gave space for a story and plot. Story-driven games did exist, but they were usually RPGs that required really long dialogs and walls of text to explain the lore, and included primitive (or none) gunplay, like the first Fallout for example. Half Life however, needed no more than a few hundred voicelines and implicit story telling to deliver a plot, which is quite the achievement event to this day, where first-person shooters still struggle to deliver stories in a meaningful and interesting way.

In short, great game, and the first shooter I ever played that got me hooked on its lore. 10/10 would beat zombies to death with a crowbar again"

Half-Life,Adventure,70,This is an amazing game that changed a lot in shooters after this point. You had to actually put  some thought into what you did more going full doom mode. From the story to gamplay and the following expansions it was a cool game for its time. I haven't tried to boot this up in while but im sure there are fixes to get it working on a modern windows 10 system . Besides expansions there are a decent number of mods to ensure replayabilty.  i also think everyoone should give this game a try before picking up Black Mesa so you can see the differences. Its 10 on a normal day and for classic I think its a awesome price . A definite recommend from me.
Half-Life,Adventure,70,STAHP
Half-Life,Adventure,70,Amazing vintage game!! A classic!!
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"Half-Life is honestly one of the best games that I have ever played. On top of that, for a game that was originally released a month before I was born, the graphics still hold up really well. The game play is fun, the enemies are interesting, and the combat is pretty on point. I highly recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it yet."
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"It's Half-Life.

From the perspective of someone born in 2002, it doesn't feel as fun as it could be, but back during the game this game was legendary and it still lives on decently to this day.

Has excellent ideas filling it, the world's storytelling and worldbuilding is subtle, and the entire Half-Life/Portal universe is immensely compelling despite extremely limited information.

I learned a lot about game design from videos about this game, and games built around the Source Engine."

I can only recommend to play it!"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"[h1]The indie game about escapism[/h1]
A short game narrate unique creepy plot with so cruel, depressed atmosphere and greatfull soundtrack. Gameplay is pretty simple: run, hide, crawl and cross the puzzles. Here's clear that the developers put heart into their creation and I believe we'll see continuation little nightmares."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,I'm just gonna copy paste my Little Nightmares 1 review because it still fits it. Does a fantastic job scaring the crap out of you with no (big) in your face jumpscares. The game makes you feel really uncomfortable in a very pleasant way. I would definitely recommend this game for some one that wants to play a horror game but really hates getting scared. I mean I was able to play through the whole game.
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Creepy, disturbing, beautiful!"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Up all night playing this game, strongly recommend."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,This game is fun and scary. I played this game after midnight and it made the experience phenomenal that I had to sleep with the lights on. I got it for sale for the price of $29.99 (Deluxe Edition).
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,i almost wet my self playing it  but it was a great adventure
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Great game! I played it with friends who aren't gamers and it was easy enough for them to play (i took over for the hard, scary bits). Definitely will play through again on my own and would recommend. Interesting story and surprising ending!"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"This is even better than the 1st LN and I didn't think that was possible. Amazing game, and would probably be easier with a controller. Trying to pass the mannequins using a keyboard isn't great."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,wew.
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"I want to like this game I really do. The aesthetics are beautifuly creepy. The character designs and sense of fear in some areas are fantastic. But the controls and frustratingly annoying gameplay hold this game back from being something I can enjoy. 

The room with the dozen mannequins was the tipping point. Being the additional axis and the wonky camera, makes that area the sole reason I went from a neutral to a negative review. Don't get this at full price, because it is not worth it."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"I loved this game as much as i loved the first one. It's creepy in a magnificent and unique way.
The only downside is it's price. In 8,4hrs i completed 2 full playthroughs. One for experiencing the story and one for gathering any remaining collectibles and achievements. I find a 30$ price tag for a ~5hrs game a bit too much for my taste.
So although i would recommend it, i would also recommend to wait for a discount before purchasing."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Puzzles are really good, the music and atmosphere really hit you and shake you up hard (in the positive way of course). The new adults(?) are super creepy and disturbing as hell, so that means they are hella good. I say get this game. 5/5"

Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Though its a short story line (6 hours completion). The animation is absolutely stunning! The graphics are scary enough to keep you on your toes, but animated enough to not give you full blown nightmares!

My only complaint is the controls (I used an Xbox controller) are a little clunky, and can sometimes not react accordingly, and some scenes of the game are very reaction/time based, so there were a few moments I had to replay repeatedly to be able to get the time right!"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,10/10 I cried
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Little Nightmares 2 is better than Little Nightmares 1. Because is much more fun, there'a more action, the story is very interesting and also is pretty easy to understand what you have to do.

10/10"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"[h1] Overpriced Nightmares [/h1]
This prequel to the first game expands upon what little we knew of the world we were trying to survive in and gives us more context for it. Little Nightmares 2 is a worthy ""successor"" to the first game, it manages to get even darker than its predecessor. The world is super atmospheric and the story is expertly crafted, this game is a must-play. Although the game is amazing it is quite short, just like the first one, without much replayability value. Therefore I suggest waiting for a sale before you purchase it."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"I'm sure this game will be nominated for quite a few awards this years. It delivers exactly what it promises, a perfect sequel to an amazing (yet short) game.

- The AI BOT is well crafted. It does the bare minimum, but still keeps the overall gaming experience interesting. 
- The hit-and-trail methods in such Indie games might be frustrating for a few.
- I found a similar problem as the 1st Part when playing with Xbox Controller, the Joystick Direction and environment interaction may act fuzzy at times, but the stunning visuals and story-line makes up for it.|
- Puzzle in the second game is more, harder, and different. In the first game, puzzles basically could be broken down into reaching certain spots by stealth or via certain paths, whereas in this one you really need to solve the puzzles (not all puzzles) by figuring out what items are needed.
- Similar to the first part,  Checkpoints were well placed which is always something I greatly appreciate since sometimes I just want to experiment with different ideas, even if I know they'll get me killed. This Second part gives more freedom of movement, there are more areas to explore. Hence, a good checkpoint placement was really essential. Great Job Tarsier Studios!


Final Verdict: 9.5/10
It's a piece of art. Stunning visuals and amazing story-telling. The AI BOT gives you a sense of friendship. It's a sequel that doesn't suck!

P.s. I'm extra thankful, got the costliest foil trading card out of this one!
Spoiler Alert: It's a Prequel.

Update: After Playing it for the second time , I feel the game is definitely a winner for Game-of-the-Year. Such an amazing storline.
- I was shocked to my core with the ending. (No Spoilers), it's very unexpected!"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,HOly shit this is better than the first and I thought that wasn't even possible
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Almost everything about this game is perfect, the atmosphere, art composition, MUSIC. 
The last hour of the game was truly amazing with a fantastic ending. 
Overall the only downside for me has been a somewhat clunky control system that got really bad at a certain point where you have to use a flashlight to progress.
The great things about this game heavily outweigh anything negative I have to say. I really enjoyed the first game and it is very hard for me to say which is better."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile, He found a crooked sixpence against a crooked stile; He bought a crooked cat which caught a crooked mouse, And they all lived together in a little crooked house."

Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"wow
just wow

after finishing this game with my group of friends on discord stream, I was sitting there absolutely speechless, blown away by pure GENIUS behind this masterpiece - because that's what this game truly is. an absolute masterpiece and a worthy addition to the Little Nightmares saga. first game was brilliant, but this? this one is straight up phenomenal
I truly can't remember when was the last time I felt so many emotions and such satisfaction after finishing any game, ever. it's a must-play for every lover of the first game, and a must-play for every person who likes puzzle games, horror games, action games... this one has it all
it was really hard figuring some of the puzzles out, but never Too hard for me to lose interest or get really frustrated over it. perfectly balanced, easy to learn, hard to master in my opinion
when it comes to visuals and audio, it's absolutely fantastic on every level. each level and boss are extremely well designed, and I could listen to the full OST all day. Little Nightmares 2 has this spectacular haunting, eerie vibe. this whole expierence is so consistently, brilliantly creepy and suspensful

and the ending, and the way this game connects to the events of the first one ... just brilliant. I was blown away by the ending, with this fantastic OST playing in the background, sitting quietly in my chair, in Awe of what I just witnessed. and there's still more for me to discover, now knowing this masterpiece has more secrets than I previously thought

an absolute must play, and absolutely worth money. phenomenal expierence on so many levels - amazing job, devs. thank you"

Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"As a huge fan of the first game I had a feeling that this one was going to be just as good and tbh... I love this one even more. I was completely blown away by how amazing this game was. I never wanted the nightmares to end even though they absolutely terrified me over and over again. The beautiful graphics and improved game mechanics, new breathtaking soundtrack and such creepy characters... also, how a story without a dialogue can be so fascinating and so intense! I am obsessed. For me, this is a perfect game. ♥"

Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Amazing! It took everything that made the first game great and made it even better! 

(Don't bother with the DLC tho, it's waaaay too short to be worth the money.)"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,The only nightmare I got from this game was the ptsd of the flashlight controls
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Magnificent. Absolutely magnificent. Leaps and Bounds ahead of the first in terms of pacing, tension, and atmosphere; but it is still very short (took me 7 hours), so if you don't want to pay 30 dollars for that then wait for a sale like the one going on at the time of writing this review."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"the game is one of the best in terms of level design, visual, style, sound in its categories, but the control however is one of the worst I've even out of its indie, puzzle categories, I've played plenty of puzzle games, I'm no hardcore platformer, but I'm no game viewer who thinks the tutorial of cuphead is hard
Here are a few I've experienced so far


******* (small) spoil warning ****** ( TL:DR in the end doesn't spoil )
1.   have absolutely no tolerance / wiggle room for interaction with environment

there's a level that has a fuse-like thing on the switch, I tried to interact with it, since there's no other clue in that level, and I just can't, then I search online for solution, turns out your position and angle need to be no visually difference to the tutorial I searched to interact with this simple fuse on the switch. it's fine to provide less feedback in a puzzle game, but this is too extreme.

2. Extremely unpredictable and inconsistent control

the flashlight level where you need to point your flashlight to ""enemy"" to freeze them shortly, you would think the direction of your flashlight is controlled independently by your mouse / right joystick (I tried both), but that would be too easy isn't it. 
Or it's relative to your head's direction? No again, Frankly, I don't know what it is, You could say the control is a mystery, I would say it relates to both your movement and your heads position, but I don't care to figure it out because it's not my job to help debug a game I paid for enjoy.

3. it's not clear how to grab edge and climb fast, and I do think auto grab when climbing is just better suited for a game more focused on stealth and puzzle

there's a quick event where I get chased by a ""enemy"", and I need to jump and grab, it turns out my speed from grabbed on edge to actually pulled myself up is affected by the height difference between where you started to jump and the edge you need to grab, let me explain:
so you the little guy are running, you jump and from a lower platform to a higher one, you jump early and grabbed the edge right on time.........great, you grabbed it and pull your self up SLOWLY, and you're DEAD
now you noticed there is a book that you can step on if you jump late, like, to a fully stop and you have to jump straight up and grab the edge if you're at the position of the book........then magic happened, you grabbed it just like before, but this time, you would pull yourself up much faster for no reason

Or maybe it's just the grabbing duration (mouse left button holding down time or trigger holding time on controller) you applied affect your pull up speed, I don't know, but it shouldn't, since visually you only grabbed for a split second. 

4. depth perception is not easy in this game, this I wouldn't deduce points to this game, since the perspective is chosen to  achieve the horror game experience. 

TL:DR
1. No feedback and also non-forgiving on interaction, causing false negative ( something interactive seems to be not interactive after you tried it, but it's just because you're a tiny little off the angle)

2. there're a levels that is too hard not because you don't know the puzzle, but just because the pointing direction is hard to control

3. you often lose to a stealth level because of your depth perceived is not what you'd think

Sadly I have to give it a NO to lower to overall reviews, this game should be on the 85% percent positive rate to match the experience with other 85% positive rated games on steam IMO





"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Every single moment was beyond expectation. 
Its unique, dreamy and spooky concepts were evolved in every way.
Though some experience seems a little bland, it is quite acceptable considering that it has simple platform gameplay.
Compared to the original which revealed some tricky intention to increase the play time by adding poorly designed DLCs, this game fairly provides not too long but still joyful experience with solid new chapters and antagonists.
If you are tempted with trailers, do not hesitate. 
It's definitely worth the price!

일부 구간이 다소 밋밋할 수는 있으나 비교적 조작이 단순한 플랫폼 게임임을 고려하면 충분히 애교로 넘길 수 있는 수준.
조잡한 구성의 DLC로 플레이 타임을 늘리는 꼼수를 선보였던 전작과 달리 
이번 신작은 탄탄한 구성의 챕터와 함께 적당히 길면서도 흥미로운 경험을 선사한다.
트레일러 보고 혹했다면 주저없이 질러보기를.
충분히 제 값 하는 게임이다."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,v gud game the teacher is absolutely terrifying
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Amazing game, beautiful graphics, exciting gameplay. And lots of scary moments!"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,keyboard very hard to control at times....apart from that 9/10 !
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"The game was just as good as the first one, but even longer, filling my day with nothing but nightmares and yelling from the repetitive deaths due to my lack of knowing i could spin.  Don't ask. Regardless, 
I give this game a 8/10

1- For the environment. Spoopy. 
2- For the graphics. 
3- For the music. 
4- For the lore and fun. 
5- For the hand holding (as in i held hands). 
6- I felt like i was satisfied with the length of the gameplay. 
7- Left me wanting a new game to play. Can't wait for DLCs. 
8- The madness

-1- it did not make me cry. 
-2- it did not have a secret after the credits. sadface panda. I waited."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"A good sequel, marred by frustrating controls.

Pros:
* Excellent, creepy levels and enemies.
* Challenging bosses.
* Great puzzles.
* Subtly fleshes out the world.

Cons:
* Controls can make it tough to enter vents/crawlspaces, especially when YOU'RE DOING [b]THE SAME CHASE SEQUENCE [i]FOR THE 10th TIME[/i][/b].

Meh:
* A few rooms require decent reflexes to fend off enemies. ([spoiler]hammering hands/bullies, and flashlighting the last mob of mannequins[/spoiler])

TL;DR: If you like 3rd-person puzzle/hide-and-seek games, 8/10 (9/10 if on sale); else, avoid."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"yeah, recomended, but please buy it when get a lower price, i finish it in 4 hours:c"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Whatever level of scary the first game was on, this one is ramped up for sure and, I'm glad about that. I'm still making my way through the game and there have been moments I've dreaded playing because of sheer fear lmao. For reference, I'm someone who played through all of the classic Resident Evil games. This isn't horror like those but, it has moments that gave me literal chills lmao. If you enjoyed the first one, you'll love this one. And if you thought the first one could have been a tad bit scarier for your tastes, this one is the answer. There are also some really cool fan feature moments for people who have played the first one. I hope it keeps this pace and, I hope it turns out to be longer than the 1st game :-)"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Probably the best game I've played in terms of quality, storytelling and atmosphere."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,The one thing I learned from playing this game is to never trust a hoe.
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Pretty good game, i would bang 10/10"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,Didn't know I need to be a [spoiler] flashing bayblade [/spoiler] in the mannequin room. 9/10
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Amazing game and as someone who has ADHD this game is always giving me new little details to pay attention to lmao. And the achievements are really quirky and random, probably one of my favourite things about this game."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,Wonderfully haunting story about friendship?
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,u have to play this game its a master piece and those are rare
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"it's a great game, if you like horror games and puzzle games this is the perfect game for you!"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,I love this game it has such a balance of having to use brain power and intense chases. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes adrenaline. 1 or 2 parts could be a bit better in such of the controls. Overall this is easily the best game i've ever played :)
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,Better than the first.
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,I did cry for 7 days
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"better than sex

9.5/10"
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"TL;DR ver:
Only game other than Witcher 3 that I bought DLC for, and I hate DLC/microtrans. That is how good this is. 
10/10 Very cute, almost as cute as my bunny. 

long ass readinisbad4health version, read on if your don't care for your health :
The statment that older games are better is true. Some argue that it is just nostalgia, WRONG. A Hat in Time is a game made with modern sensibilities (memes, references, female protag, female sidekick, female antag becoming female protag's BFF, female...etc), yet it is as good as any classics such as Mario 64, Spyro, or Crash Bandicoot, if not better. I mean a FOV slider and good camera options for a 3rd person game? In a brave new world where FPS don't have FPS sliders? Female PC, this and that without the usual man hating sexism? What a novelty! 

In all serioue though, the game is really fun. Give you loads of options, freedom and cosmetic. Art style is cute without making you puke. Game maps are divided into Acts, with different stages. Dialogues are actaully funny. All the Acts have an interesting theme, Stages are VERY creative without being gimmicky (a bit on the short side so not to overstay their welcome). Music is surprisingly...diverse, ranging from whimsical to smooth jazz to arr-se kicking to suspenseful. My friend overlay the OST on top of Assasin Creed and it fits 100%. Online mode is a anmeic, but there is actual mod support (unlike Vermintide 2), so there is plently to make it better, even it is still barebone. 

No p2w BS, no cut content lock behind 100 paywalls, no offical server needed, no ""content updates"" that remove contents/nerf your fav items/break the game and the mods (but don't bet on it, get it on GOG instead of steam), just pure wholesome fun. Fun. To paraphrase Zero Punctuation: Remember that strange little concept we are not allowed to have anymore? In the name of balance, because every game is constant online DRM multiplayer service since devs can't make good levels anymore...nah who am I kidding devs these days will nerf anything, even if its a single player game with 0 competition, otherwise who the fork would wanna buy their lastest, laziest, overpriced p2w DLC? 

Only negative is not Quick Save, but each stages are short and sweet, so not a big problem.

This game is an amazingly fun and cute lil platformer that defy modern trends, made in the ways games are supposed to be made. If you like classic games, this game is for you. If you ever played Dad sims like Witcher 3, God of War 4 or The Last of Us and thought, ""Hey these kids are awesome, I wonder what it'll be like when they are 5?"", buy this right now, sale or not. If you think the new ""Here Comes Niko"" being published by these devs is too pink and is making your eyes bleed, buy the 2 DLCs as well (while on sale)."
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,hats
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,buy. this. game.
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"you can be a an among drip, best 10/10"

Obviously I love it"
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,Love it
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"This is one of those indie gems. It's got it all; wholesome seals, the literal mafia, a penguin dj, babies with knives... WAIT WHAT?!?! Ok, let's back up a bit here. Oh, and don't worry, I'll try to keep this spoiler free. A Hat in Time is a platformer game about a kid with a hat (surprise!) that is on a quest to get back her hourglasses so she can continue her trip home. You can get different hats with different abilities by collecting yarn around maps in order to stitch them. I really like this system, since it makes unlocking hats more than just getting to a certain area and getting it. The game has a wide variety of likeable characters, from the ones I mentioned earlier to a cat that chases you in an epic escape scene to a Scottish train conductor bird thing that really likes rolling his Rs, One nice thing is that Hat Kid is really fun to move around. She can dive, wall jump, sprint, double jump, and even more all with the press of a button. It's all so fluid and smooth that you always feel so in control. And all her different hats each give her a unique ability, with you switching between them on the fly sometimes with a handy hat wheel. This... brings in one of my critisisms though, It feels like most of the hats are just extra abilities that you just use whenever its thing pops up and switch back to the sprint hat, or it's the sprint hat and you literally always have it on. That's the reason why basically every hat skin on the workshop is for the sprint hat. This leads nicely into my next point,  The game is fairly short, but if you buy the Seal the Deal DLC, there is a very big rage mode that makes the game have a signifigant amount more content, and there's the workshop for even more. The boss fights are also a real challenge, which is really nice, and they feel meaningful since you fight characters after an entire chapter. There's a lot more I could get into here, but overall, if you're done with Mario Odyssey and looking for another platformer, or just want a good game, here it is."
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"Without exageration, this is one of the best games I've ever played, you can clearly see the amount of effort used to create this game. Although with a few issues the controls are great, as good as how mario controls in his games. An amazing soundtrack with a lot of great songs. This an absolute must for fans of platformers, collectathons or indie games in general. 100% recomended"
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"I've been telling people this and Slime Rancher are two of the best non-triple A games of the 2010s ever since they came out, but I guess I forgot to review specifically AHIT.

It's cute, it's funny, it feels amazing to move around in, and the challenge available goes from beginner all the way up to some of the hardest content I've [i]ever[/i] experienced in a video game, with Death Wish contracts.

Add in the modding support with tons of custom-made maps and rifts (which continue giving tokens you can literally use to unlock [i]modded-in[/i] cosmetics of your choosing), and this game is an easy 10/10."
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"hats, yes. i run around doing stuff and get hourglasses, cool. reminds me of super mario sunshine, i love the sunshine. yes."
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"As an alien that looks like Willy Wonka as a child once said; ""This game is good and is well worth the combined price of $42."""
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,10/10 pog game
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,Best gamecube game ever not made for the gamecube
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"This is easily my favorite game on steam. Whats not to love? The characters and scenes are amazingly created and the mastermind behind the soundtrack, Pascal Micheal Stiefel, is an absolute genius. I listen to the OST over and over, I don't think i'll ever get tired of it. The online capabilities are a lot of fun too, you can very easily make new friends and run around the different levels with them, just by walking up and emoting. Despite the cherry exterior, this game can be REALLY hard. The Seal the Deal DLC adds 114 death wish stamps for you to complete, and when the first boss has been made harder than the final boss in the main game, you know you're in for a struggle. But, believe me, completing all of the death wishes is very satisfying and I was left with a sense of pride and accomplishment. 

I could probably ramble on about how much I love this game for hours, but nobody wants to read that, so, concluding, If you don't have this game yet, BUY IT NOW! I promise you it will not disappoint.

10/10"
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,this is basically super mario 64 but different
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,Peck!
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"If you love early 2000s platformers (like the GameCube / PS2 era) this it's a must.

Pros:
[list]
    [*] Charming Art Direction and music
    [*] Fun to play
    [*] Great value considering its pricing, a lot of hours of content despite being an indie dev
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] A few bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking
[/list]

If you want the nostalgia of your childhood, but at the same time something modern A Hat in a time it's a game that deserves a chance."

The Walking Dead,Adventure,207610,"Basically, it's a great story, and playing it is fun. The only downside I saw in the game was the limits of how much your choices really altered the story.

If you regularly play video games then you need to know what you are in for. It is an adventure game exclusively. No shooting (almost) or intense action, it mainly focuses on decisions using quick time events and dialogue options. It's extremely story-heavy, in fact, it is pretty much the only story using the aforementioned mechanics to drive it forward. You will hear people complain about how your choices don't matter but that isn't true. Your story will start and end the same way and you will follow the same general path but a lot of cool little things will change depending on your choices.

It's one of the few video games I've played where I've actually felt an emotional connection with the characters. I'd say it is definitely worth the 20 bucks!"
The Walking Dead,Adventure,207610,An incredible story and well-developed characters

Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"I'm not an AC fan, so I don't give a crap that this isn't a traditional AC game. I just wanted to play as an Ancient Greek warrior, and that's what I got"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"I went into this game without the mindset of [b]""it's an Assassin's Creed game, therefore it must be like every Assassin's Creed game prior and it has to have hidden blades, assassins and the templar order because it's an ASSASSIN'S CREED game!""[/b] and it feels ABSOLUTELY great! I fail to understand how people hate Odyssey for what it is, because what it is is genuinely fantastic. I think everyone should dedicate enough time towards exploring the Ancient Greek world and truly experiencing it.

The main element of ""Assassin's Creed"" is still there, it's just utilised in a different form to its predecessors.

Given the chance, Assassin's Creed Odyssey has the potential to very swiftly become anyone's all time favourite. This game has enough content to keep an average completionist playing for a hundred hours and then some!

In my opinion, people who hate the new instalments are those who have grown too accustomed to what this franchise used to be. [i]It's time to move on.[/i]"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,very many good
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"I’ve played almost every AC game in existence. From the Ezio trilogy to this. And while it’s true that this is only an AC game by name, that doesn’t mean the game is bad. I’ve played 122 hours of this game and had lots of fun with it. From the surprisingly good gameplay to the funny conversations. THIS is what I call a good open world game.

[h1]STORY:[/h1]
You play as a mercenary in Greece during the Pelponesian war. And from then on, you find out about a secret organization that’s plotting to take over Greece. So of course it’s your job to stop them by teeming up with familiar faces and taking them out. The story has some twist and turns which caught me off guard most of the time. Although the final act seems a bit weak if you ask me. Nevertheless, it’s still good and funny sometimes lol. 

You also have dialogue choices that do have consequences. It’s not as deep as some other games but it does its job.

[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]
The graphics of this game look great, but the optimization is terrible. I played this game on an i7 6700k. Most of the time my CPU went to 100% usage and was between 80-95%. Really wished Ubisoft fixed it. Otherwise, the game is detailed and pretty to look at.

[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]
The combat in this game is superb. The number of weapons and abilities you can use is astounding. From swords to spears to hammers. This game has it all. You can mix and match between abilities to give you some sick builds. You want to be a tank that outputs massive damage? Go on ahead. A glass cannon that’s fast and nimble? No problemo. 

The quests are great. You’ve got legendary beasts quests where you fight monsters, Naval quests and the usual quests. Surprised that I wasn’t bored from them lol. 

I’ve heard from a lot of people that the games is grindy and that you need to buy time savers in order to have fun. WRONG. If you play the game like you would any open world RPG, you’d see the opposite. I was over-leveled by the end because I played the game as intended: By doing side quests and exploring. Don’t listen to those who tell you otherwise.

[h1]VERDICT:[/h1]
While AC: Odyssey isn’t the typical AC game we’ve known and love. It’s still an amazing game that’s fun to explore. Combat is amazing, story is decent, and overall the game deserves to be played as long as your specs are good.

I RECOMMEND.
"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"My first day of playing Odyssey was great, just shy 8hrs of gameplay with zero issues. The next day I logged on and I have been consistently getting the same auto close issue where Ubisoft Connect needs to properly save and upload. So, I went offline on Ubisoft Connect and have had zero luck playing longer than 5-10mins at a time before it randomly out of nowhere auto closes the game again."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"After putting in some decent hours I must say this game is fantastic. There is a lot to do here, The campaign is quite lengthy and has many tasks that have to be done, so there is no shortage of stuff to do there. Although, some of the side missions are pretty much copy and pastes of each other, and the cities aren't exactly %100 unique, (you can definitely see some repetition in the smaller countries) it is still absolutely gorgeous in this game, and if your PC can handle it ultra high settings is a dream come true here. However, regardless of that fact I've done more side missions and bounties than I can count and haven't been bored yet, so that says something. I've never played any other assassins creeds before this one so I can't compare, but as a no-bias, first time experience, this game satisfies all of my needs. I %110 recommend this game to anybody who's contemplating purchasing it, it is without a doubt worth every penny."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"Pros:  
-Nice looking game
-Nice setting

Cons: 
-Most characters and quests feel shallow and uninteresting - quantity rather than quality
-It seems like every quest you get turns into 3 others, making the game a chore to get through
-Enemies are sponges in combat, they mostly scale to your level too, so they stay spongy 
-Missing the elements of an AC game, missing the elements of a good RPG

Just buy an older AC game (not origins) for an AC experience, or Witcher 3 for a good RPG; get this on sale if you want to play for the setting.

"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,Pretty awesome game though I wish it was more optimized for pc.
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"This is easily my favorite entry into the series. Kassandra was an extremely likeable main character for me. The gameplay took the best parts of Origins and polished them. Loved the mercenary mechanic. This was also the game that handled the First Civilization storyline to the best degree, in my opinion. Maybe it was because with the rest of the game dealing in ancient greek culture, there was less of an immersion break when doing the Elysium/Underworld/Atlantis DLC. 

I think what really sets this game apart from the others in the series though, is the comedic writing. I liked Origins for Bayek and Aya, and for all of the ancient Egyptian history and culture it portrayed. But I adore Odyssey for it's commitment to poke fun at itself, and for constantly seeking out to break the fourth wall. You know what makes boring fetch quests more interesting? When your character grumbles about how irritating and/or ridiculous those quests are. Or when you have to kill people like Chestoros, Braceras, Helmidios, and Legoras in order to acquire the corresponding parts to an armor set. The humor takes the sting out of the monotony & makes the main character more relatable. 

My very favorite quest turned out to be one of the last ones i did. I was wrapping up the Atlantis DLC side stories - the smaller stand-alone quests that were released between the chaptered DLCs - and let me tell you. One Really, Really Bad Day was just straight up comedy gold. Whomever was in charge of writing that one, kudos to you. And thank you. <3

Anyway, I really, really, really love this game. It's going to be hard to jump to Valhalla, where the tone is much more serious."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,The veneer runs off quick and your left with an illusion of a game; not even worth it at 75% off.
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"one of the worst stories ever. characters and motivations are so paperthin its laughable.
combat is EXTREMELY shallow and boring."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,the game play is fun but the game crashes over and over again. What is the point in owing a game that doesn't play?
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,The game itself is great but Ubisoft connect is not.
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"If a vast, beautiful open world, engaging combat/stealth, fantastic side missions and tons of activities is what you're looking for this game is worth a buy.

I loved AC4 and the fact that this game doubles down on the freedom of that game and removes the super annoying ""real world"" sequences and frustrating tail missions makes this game a vast improvement in my opinion."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"                   As much time I've spent playing this game, I can't recommend it. The 60 hours i spent is how long it took me to finish the main story line. The biggest issue I have with this game is how much fake content they put in it just to fill the empty spaces of the giant world they made. By fake content I mean the same copy and pasted fetch quests, littered all over the world. The amount of low effort, uninteresting, boring quests and npc's in the game is just so disappointing. 

          Another big problem I have with this game is the scummy business practices. Leveling up takes hours of grinding, just to rise a few levels. Each new story quest you're given is a few levels above you, sometimes even more. Forcing you to spend hours on fetch side quests, just to finally play a 10 minute story fetch quest with a couple sentences of exposition. Plus enemies are hit sponges. The combat is decent if it werent so grindy and repetitive. 

         Ubisoft's solution to the slow xp leveling? Micro-transactions. There's a $10 xp boost you can buy that makes the leveling function like a normal game. You pay $60 for the base game, then an extra 10 to be able to play it how it's meant to be played. 

         The beginning and final acts of the game are actually pretty good and entertaining. However, there is about a 25-30 hour long middle period where you're running around doing jack shit and trying to level up. overall, the game is boring with extremely grindy mechanics and scummy business practices. the game looks pretty but that's all it has to offer. everything else is extremely low effort. Thanks for reading, please don't buy this game.

Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"My Odyssey

Day 1 - Started installing 90 GB.
Day 8 - Finished installing, time to play the game.
Day 9 - Installed U play.
Day 10 - Played the actual game.
Day 11 - Paused the main quest and went on to explore the massive world.
Day 12 - Found a bandit camp. I thought my character farted but then I realized that is just the level-up effect.
Day 13 - Found another group of Bandit camp but this time with two treasure boxes.
Day 15 - You won’t believe that I found, a huge Bandit camp with four treasure boxes.
Day 16 - Wow, a tiny Bandit Camp with one treasure box.
Day 17 - Found a Bandit Camp made of some tribal women and did some tomb raiding that lasted for 6 minutes.
Day 18 - Another day, another question mark.
Day 19 - Let me guess NPC, a bandit camp is ruining all the happiness in your life. And I must go and take care of this problem.
Day 19 - Took care of the mission and my character got laid. Finally some happy ending to a bandit camp story.
Day 20 - Finished a Bandit camp mission, hoping to get laid but that didn’t happen. So I torched the mission giver’s hut. 
Day 21 - Finished all bandit camps in one area. Hoping to find something different in the next area. Found a level 36 bandit camp, I did get laid but not in the way I imagined it to be.
Day 22 - Found a tomb and it led me to a Bandit camp.
Day 23 - Got gang banged by three mercenaries in a bandit camp.
Day 24 - Enough bandit camp raiding. So, I accepted a contract mission. The objective was to loot three treasure chests in a Bandit Camp. 
Day 24 - Played some Assassins creed II & Witcher soundtrack in the background to make the game a bit exciting.
Day 24 - I started thinking about the money I paid for this game. And how this game costs 5 times more than Witcher 3 on steam sale.
Day 24 - Thought about refunding the game then I saw 40 hours count on Steam. 
Day 24 - This game could use a co-op game mode. If the game doesn’t hook me now, I am going to uninstall it.
Day 24 - Finished the contract mission and it gave me 44,000 XP. Which was more than my 40 hours of Bandit Camp Raiding. Instantly farted my way up to level 23.
Day 25 - Did some Contracts, farted to level 29.
Day 26 - Did some other contracts, farted to level 33.
Day 27 - Another Day, another Contract, leveled up to 36.
Currently - I’ve been doing some contracting work here and there. I heard rumors that this game has some story about the character that I am playing but I don’t care enough to pay any attention to it.

Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,I sunk so much time into this game building up my warship getting all the special items. The storyline is fun. All of the world building is great. What ubisoft did here was build an entire wold and storyline that was unlike things they did in the past. Well worth the money and all of the DLC that came with it.
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,LOVE this game !!! Best AC game for me
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"At the time of posting this review, i haven't yet completed the campaign once, i currently have 2 on-going campaigns as this game offers you 2 characters to choose from for your campaign, so i'm playing one campaign as Alexios and the other as Kassandra. Despite the fact that i haven't completed the main story yet, i still have nearly 100 hrs of game time and have experienced a lot of what this game offers, and believe me there is A LOT, so maybe take my review with a grain of salt as my opinions on this game probably aren't final, but i'm eager to write a review for this game right now.

I'll be comparing this game closely to Assassin's Creed Origins, which i have played to completion and is one of the best campaigns i've played, both these games are very similar, which i'll get to now by starting with what i liked about Odyssey.

The standout positive for me with this game is the expansive open-world environment, the map is to put it mildly pretty damn large, with many different environments like the sprawling metropolis of Athens to the Aegean Islands and to forests and wildernesses, with lots of items to collect, upgrades to your gear and missions and side stories to complete in the way you choose. I've honestly never seen any game that comes close to the freedom this game offers you, even Assassin's Creed Origins, which itself offers a great open-world, it's pretty refreshing to play a game like this because you can pretty much do and play the game however the hell you want at your own pace, this is the primary reason i picked up this game in the first place.

The other main positive  of this game is the graphics, which are very beautiful, they are basically on the same level of Origins, and allows you to take some nice screenshots of vast seas and oceans, beautiful landscapes and cityscapes and many more.

And, well that just about does it for the standout positives for me, so lets get into the ""less good"" bits of this game

Again i haven't completed the story yet so what i'm about to say are by no means final thoughts.

Speaking of the story, i like that you can choose different options for your characters and that certainly adds a bit of complexity and freedom to the story itself, but in small doses, the main issue i have with the story is that it is completely unfocused, the game has you running around doing 10 trillion things at once for pretty simple tasks such as finding clues to the whereabouts of people and doing pointless and tedious favors for characters so ubisoft can have you play the game more, as a comparison i'll again refer to Origins, the story in Origins revolved around bayek searching for and trying to kill all of the Order of the Ancients throughout the entire game, there was one clear objective throughout and you had some idea of what everything was building up to and as you played through the story more this was reinforced, but with the business of actually assassinating 90% of the discount templars put to side objectives, an assassin's creed game finds itself lacking any short term objectives i.e assassinating bad guys which is what AC is usually all about, and so you are left lumbering from one tedious objective to the other, and this process isn't exactly quick.

The situation with the story isn't helped very much by the characters, i'll refer to both Alexios and Kassandra as ""the Misthios"" as this is what both are commonly referred to as by strangers throughout the game and other than their genders they are exactly the same person, they even have access to all the same outfits barring one exception, but anyway, the Misthios is to be honest a decent character, they are likeable and are played very well by both the actors, they are invested in emotion and you can feel for their struggle, you can choose how the Misthios progresses through events, but they are no Bayek or Edward Kenway and they don't really have any solid personalities or traits, they behave however the plot or player needs them to and can do anything the plot also needs them to do i.e being able to captain a ship without prior sailing experience, survive a fall of a literal mountain and have all the skills of a master assassin despite being raised by markos who is a massive pussy, but still, anything is better than the fucking frye twins from AC syndicate so i'll give ubisoft credit for that, as for the rest of the characters, some of them are memorable and some aren't but there are a few who do stand out such as phoibe, myrrine and nikolaos, this is again a downgrade from Origins who had the likes of aya, cleopatra, ptolemy, appolodorus, caesar and bayek's son whose name i can't remember.

the combat mechanics are basically the same as Origins, and they are pretty decent, easy to learn and get better at handling and customisation options so that you can decide how you conduct yourself in combat, so overall pretty good, basically a more refined Origins in that regard.

as for the sailing, Origins only has a couple of missions where you can sail so i'll instead compare this to my favourite AC game : Black Flag. they are actually a step up from black flag's ship mechanics, they offer better optimization such as being able to pick lieutenants, although i prefer cannonballs and mortars to arrows and javelins, Black Flag in general offers better ship-to-ship combat but odyssey allows you to better choose how you conduct yourself in ship-to-ship combat.

Overall, if its a wide-ranging and expansive open world that you want to be able to escape to for a good few hours a day and do whatever you want, whether that be pirating ships, killing bad guys and many more things, then AC odyssey is definetly one of the top games you will be looking for whether you are an assassin's creed fan or not and i definetly give my recommendation to it, just don't expect much of a clean or focused experience, or much of a compelling story or characters out of it otherwise you're gonna come away a little dissappointed, if you are at all doubtful of the story or can't really decide what it is you want out of this game, i would wait for a juicy sale to come up."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"This Game Auto Installs in Game Controller mode, and can not be taken out of that mode, as there is no menu control available to me. Personally in a Game this Advertised and expensive, I would at least like to see a simple downloadable CONFIG file offered up to the PC running STEAM Group... It's called Good Coding. I know... That all went out with Coding Standards like line numbers... Sorry... I do not buy that... Poor Menu function and coding in the shell part of any game should not be present after a year past release..."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,YOU CAN CARRY POTS!!!
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,Malaka!
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,Best Assassins Creed.
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"So many negative arguments like : ""this is not an AC"". ""this is more like an Open world God Of War"". ""the main characters is far from Assassin's character."" and another bla, bla, bla.
DUDE! this game happened in Greece 399 BC, no assassins with hidden blade in those period, only ""Misthios"" and corrupt politicians. that is why Odyssey has a very different concept than any other AC. 
So if you're looking for traditional AC, this isn't a game that you were looking for. BUT, if you wished for a Great story of an Ancient Greek with a stunning graphic, AC Odyssey is recommended. Why? I played this game during the lockdown and it felt like I've been traveling from ASIA to Ancient Greece, everything was heavenly Greek, especially the beach. The story was wonderful too, you would see how Historical characters such as Socrates, Hippocrates, and etc, become the problem solver of the main character's problems.

So in the end, this game is worth to buy and play."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"Well Well Well. To start things of. I had a terrible first experience with Assasin's Creed franchise. I only play one game and that was Black Flag. It was terrible in my opinion so i was obviously a little bit sceptic when I bought this game. BUt oh man oh man, this game blew my mind. For you to know. Horizon Zero Dawn is one of my all-time Favo Games and Odyssey just reminded me of Horizon. It really felt like i am playing Horizon with a different Story and the Machine part. Side Quests are fun and the Main Quest is kinda weird when it comes to finding your dad. But the experience to just do whatever you want is frucking awesome. Its just a little annoying that anywhere on this world you will get hunted down by bounty Hunters but hey its just a small bit of annoyance. Achievements are quite fun, you will get most of them by playing the main Story, nothing really out of the ordinary. The 2 DLC are almost a new game they filled with so much content its nice. This Game gets a 9/10 for it changing my mind on the AC franchise."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"Bland, soulless, shallow, repetitive"

Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,truly amazing
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,story is fun but quests can get repetitive. although after a certain level you can one shot almost anyone and it's so satisfying
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"89% Positive reviews, are you serious? Generic open-world game. HUGE but empty map. 9999 side-quests yet none of them will stuck in your brain. After roaming in open world for hours and hours...I asked myself 1 question ""What the hell am I doing with my life"""
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"the game is soooooooooooooooooooo long and fun, totally worth it."

Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"It's like Witcher 3 and Assassin's Creed had a baby. At first glance, they were a happy family, but in the end, the kid couldn't live up to be like either of the parents, and neither did it develop a strong identity of its own.

For me, it's a typical 7/10 game. Definitely not trash, quite enjoyable to an extent, with high production value, but also not particularly memorable. Plain vanilla. Not even in the same genre as the first Assassin's Creed games."

Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"Though this game seems to have some controversy, I do think its a good game, and the combat elements work well. Its fun how many different strategies you can use, either running head-on into enemies, taking a stealthy approach, or mixing the two. The landscapes are also incredible, with some especially scenic views in the various mountains across the map."

 There's no fix in sight. 

Save your self the money and aggravation. Do not buy this game."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"Beautiful game ,but constantly crashes randomly,no support for this PC ver.!!!!"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"Game seems pretty fun, but apparently there is still a bug that has existed for a while that causes dialogue to be randomly skipped. Sometimes the characters still mime their movements during conversation, but they don't say anything. I've looked everywhere and apparently there's no fix for this. 

Sucks. Was really starting to get into it and then this started happening almost every conversation."

The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320, I'm going to need season 2 ASAP !
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,"""I'm not saying it's fair, but it's real. People are scared of you."" 

If this is your first Telltale game then you're in for a surprising treat and if not then you know to expect a compelling story. The Wolf Among Us is one of my favorite Telltale game alongside The Walking Dead. The voice acting is phenomenal and I really love the character designs, they were really creative with it. In this tale you play as Bigby Wolf, the sheriff of Fabletown, trying to solve the mystery of a fable that's been murdered and why their head was placed on your doorstep. There are a bunch of fairy tale characters we all know and love that you'll come across in Fabletown like Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, and so on, but don't let that fool you. The Wolf Among Us is not a child's fantasy story. These characters had to abandon their homes and happily ever afters to live alongside mundies (regular humans) in Fabletown. In doing so they're faced with real serious problems and issues like debt, forced prostitution/labor, and because of the corrupt people in power the only one they can truly rely on is Bigby Wolf. As hesitant as they are to go to him for help (considering his brutal past) they really have no other choice. Either go to the once 'Big Bad Wolf' for help or suffer in silence.

While uncovering the mysteries behind the murders in Fabletown will you play as *the* Big Bad Wolf or the Sheriff? The choice is yours."
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,the wolf is amogus sus !!!!!! :D
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,sus
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,"If you missed out on The Wolf Among Us, now is a good time to enjoy the entertaining fairy tale crime story in all its glory. I truly enjoy Telltale, so this game is the epitome of that love. And yeah i want a season 2"
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,story in this game is better than telltale's walking dead
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,"The Wolf Among Us is my definitive highlight of the old branch of Telltale's games, without any doubt. 

The game exudes atmosphere and ambience like nobody's business, coupled with this universe's fascinating premise of fairy tale characters of old being trapped in our modern reality, having to live in the shadows to protect their secret society from the mundies (us regular, non-suspecting folk). A stellar moody soundtrack breathes life into the already superb graphic novel-inspired visuals, and all of this is supported by a world with rich lore (based on Bill Willingham's [i] Fables [/i]) that leaves me wanting for so much more. While it does suffer from this studio's illusion of choice in that your decisions are ultimately funnelled down a fairly linear storyline, and there's an excess of combat since this is still a ""big dumb video game"", the story here is nuanced and solidly told to mostly negate your limited ability to shape it. Bigby Wolf is a riveting protagonist and his struggle against his true nature (being the Big Bad Wolf and all) makes for a compelling personal story, coupled with the fantastic noir-esque main plot that has you sleuthing around Fabletown, following the footsteps of an elusive killer. 

This review might seem a tad bit redundant, considering the overwhelmingly positive reception on the game's page, but I love it so much to throw my cent(s) in there regardless. This is a game not-to-be-missed!"
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,"The game is carried by a strong setting and story. If that is what you're looking for, buy it, play it, you'll like it. 

The negative are these: The gameplay is rather flat. Quicktime events in ""fights"" are there to keep you on your toes, but are (thakfully!) rather easy. For a moment I thought it might be a detective game, but it is not. Choosing the dialougue options was fun; you do it under time limit and it is a good idea to think about how ""your Bigby"" sees himself and the world, so you can act quickly and in accordance with how you want him to be. I'd need to replay the game to see how much of a difference it really makes though.

In the end, there are no deep game systems, but that helps to keep the focus on experiencing the story with just enough involvement that I still felt like I was playing a game instead of watching a movie."
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,"UwU
[spoiler]Now let's say hypothetically I was the impostor. How would I get from reactor to medbay in that timespan, from which we saw each other, till you found yellow dead. Also if I were the impostor hypothetically speaking, how would I have finished all my tasks.

It's important to note that Reds commit nearly 52% of all the murders in Among Us, which is astounding when you take into consideration the fact that they make up 12-13% of the population. It gets even more astounding when you start considering the fact the bulk of Reds committing these murders are probably ages 8-18 which is probably around an estimated 6-7% of the population that means that around 7% of Among Us Players are committing around 50% of the murders.

Me (M 9) screamed ""dead body reported"" at my aunts funeral. My mom said that my aunt died and that we are going to her funeral the next morning. As soon as she left the room crying I busted put laughing because it reminded me of among us a popular video game. So as we were riding in the car I was thinking about saying ""dead body reported"" at the funeral. When we finnaly arived I screamed ""dead body reported"" everyone was looking me like if some sort of a weirdo. Then I remembered that my grandfather's sister fell in the vents and died when she was 2 years old. So I said grandpa's sister sus she vented. My grandfather started crying and everyone was screaming at me instead of laughing. My mom took my x box and said that I am going to therapist tomorow. Idk my mom is acting kinda sus 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

You open your eyes. Chains cover every inch of your limbs. Movement is not an option. One thing is certain: you are not in the Airship anymore. You look up and see a figure walk towards you, but not much can be determined about it specifically. Eventually, you slowly make out a massive, red, dripping cock in the shadowy essence of a person. All of the sudden, a massive, gargantuan hand grabs your abdomen, immediately impairing any breathing and blood circulation that was happening in that area. As you slowly feel the dominating pressure crumbling your bones and squeegeeing your organs, you are able to see a face through your bloodied eyes. Red. Of course. He was sus from the start. However, it's much too late. As you fall victim to the impostor's cum jar collection you hear your very last sound, a grim reminder of your fate.

""Amogus.""

I was only nine years old. I loved Among us so much; I had all the merchandise and the skins. I played Among us every night before bed. Thanking Among us for hours of entertainment, I been given. ""Among us is love,"" I say, ""Among us is life.""

My dad hears me and calls me, ""A noob."" I kenw he was just jealous of my devotion for Among us. I call him, ""Sus."" He slaps me and sends me to bed. I am crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold.

I feel a warmth move towards me. I feel something touch me. It's the Among us characters. I am so happy. They whisper in my ear, ""Are you the imposter?"" They grab me with their hard-working crewmate hands and put me on my hands and knees.

I'm ready. I spread my asscheeks for the Among us characters. They penetrate my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for the Among us characters. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push againist their force. I wamt to please the Among us characters. They roar a mighty roar as they fill my butthole with their love.

My dad walks in. The Among us characters look him straight in the eye and say, ""It is all sussed now."" The Among us characters leave through my window. Among us is love, Among us is life.

This game has ruined my fucking life. I'm going to end it and take you all with me because I can't bear to look at anything anymore. Any shape I see is distorted into amogus, any time I hear the word suspicious, sus, task, vent, report, ANYTHING, human pattern recognition turns it into amogus. I close my eyes and i see amogus, i see jerma985 grinning as the gates of my soul are opened by amogus and I can feel the festering sclunge of words and shapes pour in, filling all that I am with the ringing noise of amogus[/spoiler]"
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,"holy shit this game is cool as fuck, where is the 2nd game?"
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,"Like many others have said, this is the best Telltale game yet.

9/10"
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,"The best game Telltale ever produced in my opinion. Sure, like all these ""choice"" games a lot of choices are kind of irrelevant and ultimately change very little, but the story, the acting, the setting, the fantastic take on Fables, all make for a compelling Noir themed detective game. I'm not sure how some of the characters know certain things that JUST HAPPENED somewhere else, and the game even calls that out and handwaves a few times, but overall it's an excellent (and at least once replayable) game."

Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"[quote]Outer Wilds is best experienced with as little prior knowledge as possible, and I took this into account while writing the review. Therefore, I’ll only go into detail about the core mechanics of two planets.[/quote] 

[h2][b]A Stroke of Genius[/b][/h2]
In a gaming landscape where [i]""open world""[/i] has become synonymous with map markers, giant yet empty areas, and more bandit camps than you'll ever want to capture, Outer Wilds is a breath of fresh air. Just like Dark Souls denied the often-too-easy nature of video games when it was released, Outer Wilds isn't interested in guiding you towards every little thing on your journey. It's a game about exploration, and not just in the sense that there's a map and some places to travel towards, but because it actually lets you explore — which is a novelty nowadays. 

It does have a world map, but you won’t see sixty-two question marks when you open it, nor does it just show you where to go. There’s a real sense of discovery in Outer Wilds. That’s not to say that your typical open-world game doesn’t provide any enjoyment, but Outer Wilds’ feels earned. There was no miniscule map in the left corner of my screen showing me exactly which direction I should head in to reach the ruins I marked on my map. I’d imagine the people who first discovered the ruins of Pompeii didn’t have that either. 

It also helps that there are plenty of things to discover, and I’m not talking about the usual open world affair. There are secrets to find, moments to be had, and marshmallows to roast. Uncovering the mysteries will take time, but it’s oh-so-satisfying to witness how everything you’ve discovered, every little clue, comes together. In most open-world games, the locations found off the beaten path are additional content, stuff you can do if you're not too busy with the actual story. In Outer Wilds, they play a substantial part in the experience. And because of that, they're more consistent. Nothing feels like the result of a tired employee who still had to add two locations to a planet before calling it a day. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2524450673

If you’re stuck, you can always drift away to another planet and come back later. This is a game that encourages you to take your time and care more about the experience and less about the goal. The small moments, like roasting marshmallows at a campfire while listening to a relaxing tune and looking up at the sun, are just as important as the big surprises. Everything matters.

Another central part of the experience is failure. When I first pulled on my spacesuit and ventured into the world on offer, I died almost immediately. But with each death, I learned something new. It wasn't the devs sitting in a corner, laughing hysterically while eating popcorn as I made one mistake after another. It was a lesson, a chance to improve and avoid that mishap the next time. I know I have to hurry when I’m exploring the caves of Ember Twin if I don’t want to be caved in by the rising sand. I know falling into the giant black hole will teleport me to God-knows-where. And I know this not because the game explicitly told me so, but because I discovered it through my own failures. 

Even so, this isn’t a game for the action-seeking gamer. The closest you’ll come to combat is being chased by a giant fish-creature that fancies you as its afternoon meal, and there’s no grand boss to fight either. This is a game that knows its audience and doesn’t attempt to shoehorn in mindless action with the goal of appealing to the masses. In other words, if you want to shoot some bad guys, this ain’t the game for you. The challenge comes from the aforementioned mechanics each planet brings, which also forced me to play the game differently, to experiment, to look at things from another angle, like a scientist on the verge of their career’s highest point. I was never big on puzzles, but I loved solving the ones found in Outer Wilds.

My only gripe is one that’s not easily solved. Towards the end, there’s less things to do because, well, there are less things left to discover. This means that it’s no longer possible to drift away when that one puzzle is driving you crazy. After more than 20 hours of playing, I succumbed to the urge of googling, abandoning my goal of finishing the game without using a guide. Solving this would be difficult, if even possible. Perhaps some flaws can’t be fixed. 

With that said, make no mistake: Outer Wilds is absolutely incredible. Accompanying everything I just mentioned is a touching and almost wistful story about the ventures and discoveries of a long-gone civilization and their impact on the universe. It’s one that’s hard to talk about extensively without spoiling anything, but its correlation to the gameplay shapes a well-rounded experience in which everything makes sense. It was this connection that resulted in one of the most tense and stressful situations I’ve ever experienced in gaming. I envy you, the reader, who’ll be able to play it for the first time. 

I might as well say it out loud and clear: Outer Wilds is one of the best games I’ve ever played.

Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,I cried  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"In our world increasingly full of mediocre games and recycled tropes and genres, Outer Wilds is the supernova that you happily and willingly stare straight into, fixed gazed, while it destroys your retinas with its shining brilliance and puts galaxies between itself and the vast majority of games that currently exist. There are very few games that are truly this good. 

The rest is up to you to find out."

Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Outer Wilds es un jueguito cautivador construido de manera inteligente y muy cuidada que plantea un misterio inicial en un mundo completamente abierto.
Conforme exploramos los rincones del sistema solar encontramos pistas y piezas del puzzle que forman la historia, permitiéndonos atar cabos sin ningún orden en particular. Esto quizás requiera algo de paciencia a veces y de atención al detalle, pero el juego sabe compensarte y picarte la curiosidad.

Es un poco difícil hablar de este juego porque cuanto menos se sepa antes de entrar en él, casi que mejor. 

Recomendaría Outer Wilds a todo el mundo. Es muy bueno, tiene una historia y una banda sonora preciosas, y sin duda es de esos que dejan huella."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,It's like a walking sim but fun and actually really cool. I wonder how fucking awful some of this was to code and test because it's got some cool shit.

Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"One of, if not the best space exploration game. Great visuals and sound along with an interesting story that keeps pulling you in. I definitely recommend this game, especially played without any outside information :D"
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,quite the adventure
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"I never write reviews (i have like 3? and most of them because of the steam awards) but man this is the best game i've played in years, [b]lovely soundtrack[/b], [b]interesting lore[/b], [b]awesome puzzle design[/b]. 
I played the game with a friend watching the whole playthrough and he was so invested in it as i am, so i guess it's a [b]cool game for backseat gamers[/b]. If you like [b]puzzle games and exploration[/b] , this game is a must.

Also i bought it on discount, now i honestly feel really bad for not paying full price."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,This game has quickly become one of my favourites. If you are into sci-fi and solving mysteries this game is for you.
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Don't look stuff up for this game. Just get it. It's so good. Please. Take my word for it. Go in as blind as possible, don't use any walkthroughs, just play through it to the end and figure things out yourself. Unpicking this game's knot is one of the best experiences I've had in a video game. Please just play it I cannot recommend it enough."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,This is hands down The Best (Horror) Game I have ever played so far.

Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"One of the best if not the best exploration game I have ever played. Every single thing that happened made me want more, and despite a relatively small, short and empty world, it still felt completely alive."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,This game is so amazing and unique truly a work of art.
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,Don't look up anything just enjoy the space antics and discovery as you explore the solar system of quirky and unique planets set to an amazing score
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Outer Wilds is a game that grips the imagination, and creates a fully fleshed out world for players to investigate, explore, and engage their creativity all the way through. The music and art style complement the game perfectly, and at the end, the players are left feeling completely satisfied, and yet, with a deep, longing nostalgia, and a desire for more.

This review will be as spoiler free as possible. It will contain only information from the Steam store page.

Outer Wilds is a game about exploring a micro sized solar system, trapped in an endless timeloop. You have roughly 22 minutes every timeloop to explore the solar system and learn about what's going on, all the while getting wrapped up in the myraid of mysteries to explore and unravel. The beauty of the game is that it is identical from start to finish: The only barriers to completion are the player themselves' knowledge and ability to grasp the situation. At no point are you artifically gated by game events. I think this is absolutely wonderful, but it also crreates a game that craves for the player to be immersed, curious, and self driven.

You are given a spaceship that you can fly around - it's relatively intuitive, and in space, there is a helpful autopiloting system. Your personal spacesuit works similarly, and you need to balance fuel and oxygen as you explore. The solar system is bitesized, and easy to traverse, and the planets are as well - but that's not to say there aren'tt tons of nooks and crannies to find and poke your head in. The game is bound by the roughly 22 minute time loop, and the game does helpfully offer you a robust journal system to allow you to track your discoveries.

The music is just about flawless. It perfectly encapsulates the ""down home space program"" feel of the game, and onwards through the entire journey. There isn't much more I can say here without absolutely gushing for paragraphs on end about the songs. They're wonderful, play it with the music up.

Overall, there isn't much more I can say about the game without it feeling like spoiler territory. The game is a puzzle solving ""walking simulator"" of sorts. There are no 'abilities' to unlock, you don't get upgrades, there's no crafting, it's just you, your spaceship, and the ultimate mystery. You travel freely around the solar system, investigating whatever you want to in the order you want to, and slowly... slowly... the pieces will come together.

If being driven by your curiosity, and the desire to know more, sounds like a game you could get into, then look no further than Outer Wilds - it is an absolute treat for the senses."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"other than asking a friend for hints in 2-3 spots since I got stuck, I had a real blast with this game.
Fuck the hourglass twins' sand though."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"This isn't a terrible game, but I just personally don't find it engaging. Maybe it's my adhd brain, but I find it's more frustrating tedium than fun exploration or adventure. The game's selling point is player freedom and exploration yet it simultaneously CONSTANTLY penalizes you for this. The oxygen meter, the fuel tank, zero checkpoints, the obtuse environments, the time-specific areas, and clunky controls are all just negative player feedback that hinder this core loop too much. You don't really ""solve"" puzzles so much as stumble across the answers, and even that feels unsatisfying. It just feels like there's not enough reason to keep exploring because the game never rewards you with anything aside from drawn out dialogue boxes to read."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"A stunning open world with a whole solar system to explore, an ancient mystery to solve, and complete freedom to do so at your own pace. Avoid spoilers; you'll regret them for certain. Definitely a solid game worth buying at full price, and jumping on if you're lucky enough to find it on sale."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"I don't think there's much I can say about this game that hasn't been said already without spoiling it severely. If you're on the fence, give it a MINIMUM of 30 minutes to get into it, though I would suggest at least an hour and a half. The game is incredible and I'm seriously glad I finally gave it a shot after seeing vague reviews for so long. The reviews are vague for a reason, that being that the game is built around exploration and discovery, and a review that tells you what there is to explore or discover would in a way remove some of the magic of discovering it on your own. If it's not for you, you can always refund it on Steam, but if you're anything like me you will be completely sucked in and enthralled by the world that this game presents."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Don't watch this game. Play it.

One of the few games I wish I could play for the first time again."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Holy cow. Play this. Also, don't look up any guides. You can do this."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Jumped in with no expectations and turned out to be one of the most unique experiences I've had with a game ever. It starts a bit slow, but after the first hour I couldn't stop until finishing it.
Make sure you avoid spoilers."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"An incredibly cool an unique experience, can't tell you more than that without spoiling it."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Outer Wilds is a game I saw 2 minutes of gameplay of, and immediately wrote it off. I had seen the raving reviews, but did not understand them at all. It looked like a boring walking simulator with maybe a good story, and while many players love games like these, it really isn't my cup of tea. And so I took it completely off my radar. 

Man I was just so dead wrong. Outer Wilds is the best game I have ever played, and is a game I will probably remember playing forever. If you have so much as made it to the steam page and are reading this, just buy the game. I would have gladly spent $60 on this in hindsight.

I will not spoil anything in this review, but this game masterfully combines all of its core systems. Everything from puzzle solving, exploration, lore, and death. Every single system in this game has giant arrows pointing back at one another and reinforcing the core experience. That core experience is discovery, epiphany, and the quest for knowledge. Your goal for the entire game is nothing but to learn and discover, unraveling the mystery of this game's universe.

Even in my favorite games, I can look at the dozens of systems within the game and point at flaws in a small handful- maybe the story isn't great, or there is some combat mechanic I don't like- whatever it is I can usually find some small thing I would change that would make the game ideal for me. In Outer Wilds there is not 1 thing I would change about it, it is masterfully crafted.

My overall review, the Outer Wilds is a masterpiece. It will require patience and a willingness to explore and discover, but put in that time and effort and you will find an unforgettable experience."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"FANTASTIC GAME!  And to whoever made the virtual reality mod, THANK YOU!  This game feels like it was made for VR, and it was such a treat to explore this solar system as if you were actually there.  Especially with all of the work that the developers put in to make this solar system immersive (the sights, sounds, physics).  The story, graphics and gameplay were also fantastic.  

Awesome game, highly recommend it (again, ESPECIALLY in VR).  Played on Quest 2 with Virtual Desktop app.  

Please make more games like this!  10/10"
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"This game is is a great game in my opinion and i had a blast playing it. There are many amazing experiences to have, but not everyone may enjoy this game. 

The pros: 
-exploration is fun and satasfying, 
-dying is not very punishing (most of the game) 
-sounds and music are very cool, but everyone can have a different experience with music.
-progression is clear and it will tell you if you have missed something significant. Or if something significant is happening

The cons: 
-game is realistic which means movement and space traversal can be difficult and clunky if you dont know how to control it
-controls can be annoying as i have held the wrong button and exploded by accident. (It was actually very funny for me)
-sometimes puzzles can be vague and i got stuck a bit
-game can be very laggy in some places if your computer is on the lower end 


There are many cool details and it is an innovative game which you can explore where ever you want to go and do whatever you want to do within the Games bounds

If you can enjoy the pros and you can tolerate the cons this game is great and an amazing immersive experience and i recommend you try it out as it is an experience you dont want to miss out on. If you dont like it at all then at least you can get a refund"
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"This is one of those titles: the kind where you should go in cold, having read and seen as little as possible before you embark. If what you want is an unspoiled story, a journey of the mind, and you know what that means -- stop reading right now and do yourself the favor.

I don't want to ruin that for you. You still might be undecided, though, especially if you're not down for the kind of experience that Outer Wilds offers. It spoils nothing to say this experience is a knowledge puzzle. It is a love letter to archaeology. It also happens, for the most part, in your head.

What? Right, I'm suggesting you ought to put down $30 on a graphically beautiful and intricately choreographed solar system in a bottle for an experience that is mostly cerebral. You will never witness any of the primary action of this story. Your graphics card will not render it for you. It will render, in glorious and catastrophic detail, the unfolding of events as everything you are exploring and thinking about falls apart around you, but these spectacles will not be how you remember the world.

All that happened to place these things here, so that you might observe their decay, happened long ago. You are a late arrival on the scene. You are the archaeologist, rebuilding in your mind the creations you are exploring with their meticulous creators' written communications as your guide. You will be the first, and only, to learn their entire generation-spanning story.

You will remember last recordings, etiquette lessons on message boards, terrible puns, triumphs, failures, and final resting places. You will remember people you've never met who labored their entire lives for something only you, now, learning from their mighty works as they crumble under your feet, may yet have a chance to see.

This is a knowledge puzzle. It is built on catharsis. It reveals its solution to you only when you know and understand all it has to show you, and it rewards you from within with something you can keep forever if you have taken the journey on your own.

I don't have any more poetry for you. Someone else did a much better job. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/balinares/recommended/753640/]Go read their review[/url] if you still need more."

Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Outer Wilds probably became one of my favourite games: combination of exploration with small puzzles in world with compact story without any loose ends. And what a world! It truly made me want to explore every corner and at the same time managed to signal perfectly when area doesn't have anything to discover.. by having every area meticulously designed. I got through most of the game (few achievements and dialogues still to gather) without using spoilers in around 23 hours. In very rewarding and fulfilling 23 hours.

Only problem with the game is that it REALLY requires one to play 22 minutes (non-menu time) to discover the main plot element. After that, pure bliss."

And the soundtrack. Soundtrack is wonderful."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,Made me cry
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"This game perfectly encapsulates the wonder of space exploration. It puts you in the shoes of an alien astronaut/archeologist, gives you a quick tutorial on space travel and then lets you explore the entire solar system at your own will. Your task is to put together the fate of an ancient civilization and to figure out the reason behind some strange phenomena occuring in your own solar system. Even though the game never directly tells you what to do or where to go, I've never felt lost or got frustrated once in my ~20h playthrough."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"I have never played a game that has made me feel the way Outer Wilds has.

Everything about this game is perfect, from the gorgeous visuals to the stellar music, incredible story and unique game mechanics. This game is an outlier in the hundreds of games I've played over the years, and easily takes the spot of my favourite. If I could go back 18 hours and replay this game blind again, I would in an instant. The raw emotion of the ending was enough to put me in a half-crying half-hollow state, and all I could do was sit and think about what I had just experienced for hours afterwards.

If you don't play this masterpiece, you're missing out on one of the best designed pieces of media to come out in years. Seriously, just buy it."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"One of the most amazing games I've ever played. There truly isn't anything quite like it. The way everything comes together piece by piece is satisfying, and the exploration is truly top-notch."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Well written,creative and at times even innovative, a rare find in today's industry"
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Outer Wilds is the kind of game that solely represents a one time experience. The multitude of things to explore, and the fact that everything in the game connected in such a beautiful way really makes it stand out. It is truly one-of-a-kind in both the realistic space physics coming from masterfully crafted game design, or the experiences that you share with the game. Either way, this game is one all should try, it will leave you wanting more and more every single time you play it."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"What is the review about?
If you want to know why there are so many positive reviews about Outer Wild? And you wonder what the game it is? Then here is the review of Outer Wild for you without spoiler.


What is the game about?
The game is about you as an alien pilot. And today is your first launch day. You can finally fly your spaceship to explore the star system. The game doesn’t tell you a specific goal at the beginning but you will find out you’re trapped in a time loop very soon. 

The game is basically an open world star system consists by several planets. Information and puzzles are everywhere. You need to collect the information and figure out the puzzle to learn more about the past and present events of each planet in a final goal for figuring out why happened to you.

What I like about the game
-It is a unique open world game with a whole solar system you can fly to. Each planet has its own characteristics and orbit such as different gravity level;

-The theme of the game is unique about space, alien and a time loop. Based on the information you gathered, it will tell an interesting story.

-The control of your spacecraft is very unique; it’s weird and hard to control at the beginning. It does require a bit of skills to move your ship around. When you do, it is a joy to drive the ship around to go the place you want; 

-It is totally not hand-holding. As mentioned above, the game does not even give you an objective at the beginning. No fast travel system, no quest marker. You have to explore and plan where have to go next. 

- Family friendly.

What I don’t like about the game
-I know it’s a crowd-funding title and the price of the game is not expensive. Still, you will find out the graphic is not good. Precisely, it is missing some details of the item such as dirt on the wooden plank; 

-No voice over with the dialogues of characters. Result in missing the immersion.
-Due to not handholding, the game is a bit overwhelming at the start which you don’t have an idea where to go next and what is the objective of the game.

-You will die a lot in this game. Some deaths are instantaneously. Don’t have a choice to avoid it. Feel punishing sometimes. If you play the game totally blindly like me, you may spend hours testing hypothesis which turns out false at last.

-The control of the character is a bit weird and clunky. For example, you need hold and then release the button to jump. 

Overall
It is a unique open world space and alien theme game focusing on exploring and puzzles. The game has an interesting story and unique control spaceship. If you are the type of person like solving puzzles and don’t mind keep dying to solving it and you don’t mind the quality of graphic. Then this may be a game for you. At last, I think the game deserves some attentions for trying to create something different than others.
"
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"When I first booted this game up I never anticipated myself shedding tears by the end of it. I mean this truly when I say this is one of the beautiful pieces of art I’ve experienced ever, or at least in a very long time. If this has piqued any unknowing person’s interest let me elaborate. ‘Outer Wilds’, not to be confused with ‘The Outer Worlds’, is an exploration-based sci-fi game where you traverse a small solar system to unravel its mysteries. If it sounds vague it’s because it kind of is at first. In the beginning, you get a small set of tutorials on how to use your tools and control your ship. Even these can be missed or remain incomplete, which represents the nature of this game perfectly. Once you have access to your ship you are free to explore any planet you see. There are environmental hazards that may trip you up and rogue notes that hint towards a larger narrative but it’s up to you to seek out the solutions and answers. Just like with tackling planets you can tackle any mystery at your own pace. It truly is as open as I describe it. I’ve never played a game that has held on to my attention throughout its entirety. Boredom was rare, only ever peeking when I had to wait for certain environmental shifts to be complete. Even then they patched in the ability to rest at camps to skip to the specific time you want. Beyond that there is so little wrong with this game it blows my mind. Spoiling anything would be a huge disservice to this game. I went in blind and hearing the music for the first time, solving each mystery on my own, taking on this journey was unlike anything I have played before. It’s funny how I just randomly decided to play this. You just never know when you might come across one of your favorite games of all time. 
"
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"The less you know before playing it, the more you'll enjoy it. Here's what I can say without spoiling anything: It's about exploration and finding clues about the big mysteries you're faced with. Your reward for finding something is more information, progress is made through knowledge. It's an amazing game, but it's impossible to tell you why without ruining it."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"3 Things to note:

1. The less you know about this game, the better your experience will be.
2. Being into space / astronomy is not a must, but it's definitely a bonus.
3. As a skeptic of overly praised games -""Game of the Year"", ""Overwhelmingly Positive"", etc', I'll admit that this game deserves those titles."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Look, I haven't played much of it, but I can already say that this... is a very banger game. :>"
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"This game is amazing. When I started it, I played 8 hours straight. And I hadn't done that for years.

I'm a sucker for space exploration games with realistic/semi-realistic physics. Once you're used to the flying controls, it's to fun to fly around planets and enjoy the scenery.

And then you begin exploring ruins, find out clues and trails to follow and figure out the story of the Nomai who lived in the solar system years ago. And the game is truly open world, you can do and find everything in any order but sometimes you just have to know where to look. There are no upgrades, no tools to find, you have everything you need from the beginning.

But the one thing that makes this more than a visual novel tacked to a physics simulator is that the world and story are so well crafted. Every planet in the game has a a fun unique gimmick that makes them truly different to explore, my favourite one being the hollow planet that breaks into pieces. The story story is also pretty much flawless. Everything links together, everything makes sense chronologically and everything you find in the world has a logical reason to be there.

There are only a few warnings I would give before you buy.

- You need to be fine reading. Most of the story will be written.
- You need to enjoy figuring stuff out on your own, trying different things. A couple of things can be frustrating to understand but they ultimately make sense.
- Also go into this as blind as you can. Figuring things out was most of the enjoyment for me.

I also have a couple of nitpicks but they don't really take away from my enjoyment of the game i'm just listing them out [strike]because I like to rant[/strike] for the sake of discussion and constructive feedback.

- The home world has a couple of points of interest but the rest of the planet is truly barren and ugly. It's the only planet like that. Every single one has interesting terrain between POIs but the home world looks like a sphere with grass texture.
- The game will sometimes waste your time. For some things, you'll need the right timing and missing it will just leave you hanging until you get an other opportunity.
- Deep Bramble [spoiler]was way too spooky in my opinion. Pretty much the whole game is a chill exploration game (unless you're afraid of depths) but this planet was so frightening by comparison. However, I loved the slow build ups for this location. (The seed with harmonica music, the dead fish, the story of the Vessel arriving in the solar system...) It really builds up this feeling that there is something weird lurking out there.[/spoiler]
- The E[spoiler]ye of the Universe ending is... quite a trip. I didn't hate it but it didn't feel very satifying to me since everything leading up to it felt very grounded (outside of the sci-fi techs and quantum shenanigans) and then it goes full bonkers at the end.[/spoiler]
- So now that I finished the game, I began reading about it online and learned that [spoiler]there are more than one endings. But all my clues and trails are exhausted now and I really don't know where to look for more. Am I supposed to try random shit until something works? I'll update this when I figure it out or give up and look it up but for now I'm kind of confused about this.[/spoiler]

So, this is probably the coolest and most unique game I've played in a long time, I could talk about it for hours. I'd love to see some kind of sequel or DLC for this. But, whatever this studio puts out next, I'm here for it."

Controlling a little spaceship with similar orbital physics as our ""real world"", the player then goes to explore the vastness of the outer space without an actual objective, but mysteries of an ancient civilization soon starts to mix with the information you gather and it all expand immensely... and suddenly, there is a flash. The player is then presented to the main mechanic of the game: trapped in an inevitable time loop, just as you begin to unveil and connect everything!
Simplistic by design, [i]Outer Wilds[/i] tells a beautiful story of science fiction, ironically packed with implicit philosophical commentaries natural of the literary genre, admirably presenting an remarkable adventure worth of praise in the current multitude of ""empty"" games. Exactly like the stars in outer space.

Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"The problem with recommending the Outer Wilds is that it's best to go in blind, but to share what made it such a great experience for many people is to kind of spoil that. I was lucky enough to stumble upon in on Steam and bought it on a whim, so I went in as blind as you possibly can with a modern game. I didn't even know about the time loop mechanic (despite the fact that it says it on the Store page, RIGHT THERE!)

What I'll say is that if the screenshots and trailers pique your interest, if the vibe or music works for you, consider giving the Outer Wilds a try. The gameplay revolves around flying between planets trying to unravel the game's mystery with progression being based solely on your own understanding the game's solar system and its story. No ship or tool upgrades or whatnot. Just reading and solving environmental puzzles. The central mechanic of the solar system is a bit arcane, but I think the game does a well enough job in helping players wrap their heads around it.

On a slightly spoilery note, I'll share one of the biggest impressions the game left on me. The story and its themes strike an emotional note somewhere between[spoiler]this optimistic, adventuring spirit, and this sense of loneliness and inevitability.[/spoiler] I love it. I'll listen to the soundtrack every once in a while and certain songs can make the entire game just come flooding back to me."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"22 minutes later...

When I first loaded into Outer Wilds, I was frustrated at the horrible mouse & keyboard controls. I said to myself: ""How could a modern PC game have mouse & keyboard controls as bad as this?"" ... thankfully, though, I decided to continue using a gamepad (as is suggested to you by the developer in one of the first screens of the game.)

I'm so glad that I was able to do that, because despite not being able to use my preferred input method, what ensued in the next 23 hours could only be described as *amazing*.

A lot of people compare this game to Subnautica, and they are absolutely correct in that comparison, although there is a major distinction: This game is *pure* exploration. It isn't weighed down by hunger or thirst mechanics (although there is limited oxygen). It feels very liberating to know that the only limit to how much you'll be able to explore is your health, oxygen- or time. You see, the world resets every 22 minutes. What you did in those minutes is erased each time. What you *learned*, however, is kept. This creates a loop where each time you 'die' you feel like you gained a new direction, maybe you found some new knowledge, or discovered a new hidden location. This is how you play the game.

Everything in this game is also made by a real person! No procedural algorithms! This makes every discovery so much better because it feels like there's much more of a design and story behind it.

My only complaint for this game is that an important area of the game towards the end has an entrance that is *really* hard to find. I had to look up a guide because I was genuinely stuck and couldn't progress. I hate doing that...

Otherwise this game is absolutely fantastic. 

P.s: I think the next game should have a Scanner device like Subnautica. It would be nice to have bits of text to read about some of the more obscure findings instead of just being left in-the-dark on some things."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"(Before reading, I completed this game on Epic, which is why the playtime is alot lower than it should be after reading the review)

This is a masterpiece of a game. It is the best game out there to date, hands down. I think everyone should experience this. I don't even know where to begin with all the pros on this, there are way to many.

Everything about this game is perfect, from the story, sound, game play, exploration, puzzle solving and the unique system that the game offers. There is no linear story, you make your own decisions when you want, right from liftoff. If there is somewhere you want to go, go there. If something is preventing you, figure out how to get passed it. The only thing stopping you is time...

Speaking of which, this took me around 18 hrs to complete, even though technically, it can be completed within 20 mins. I will say this, USE YOUR SHIPS STORY LOG AS MUCH AS YOU CAN! I cant stress it enough, as long as you have explored those areas, it gives you all the information you need to progress. I was genuinely stuck for 2-3 days trying to solve this one thing, which I stupidly tried brute forcing over and over again, when the ships long had the answer all along. You really have to use your big brain for some of the puzzles though, but when you solve em, damn does it feel good.

This game is perfection, its worth the price tag. I would happily pay more (and have) for this if I knew how good it was.

Buy the game."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,Play it
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,SHEEESH
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,Why is this not labeled as psychological horror? Its terrifying that I can never complete this game again.
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"This was such a fantastic game, I really wanted to refund this game at first because of how confusing the flight control were but once I got the hang of it the mystery really dragged me in. I don't think a game has ever pulled me in as much as outer wilds has. The ending was so beautiful after unravelling the mystery and I don't think I've ever enjoyed a games narrative as much as this. I wish all my friends could experience this game as I have and I hope they do one day."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"The Outer Wilds is a very well crafted game that deserves all the attention and accolades it can get. 

Interesting, engaging and compelling for most of the time then towards the end it punches you in the stomach and leaves you curled up on the floor crying while it saunters off into the distance with a look on it's face that says ""Yeah, you won't be replaying me any time soon but give it a few years and you'll be back, to end it the same way: quietly sobbing and emotionally wrecked."""
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,wow.
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,I've spent my life playing video games. This one stuck with me. It's up there with my favorite games of all time. If you're on the fence then please just buy it.
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,Beautiful game
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,Very fun game
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,This may just be my 2nd favorite game ever.
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,A once-in-a-lifetime experience.
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"A masterpiece, couldn't stop play"
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"A perfect game that revolves around pure and unadulterated exploration.
First 10 minutes felt like a meh kind of game, but once I set foot on another planet everything clicked and I couldn't stop exploring and learning more about the world.

Great setting, amazing exposition and one of the best and most satisfying endings.
30 years playing videogames and this is one of my favorite games of all time without a doubt."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"So far the exploration and mystery is fun, with a little bit of space flight thrown in."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"I need to preface this by stating that in order to get the most out of this game, you MUST play it blind. You have no idea how much I would give to play this game for the first time again. The experience that this game provides is one that is unique an unlike anything else I have ever seen. 
This has become my all time favourite game and I cannot rave more about the quality, depth and immersion that this game provides. 
It might not be for everyone, but if you enjoy a game with an incredible story and pure freedom, get this as soon as you can.
10/10"
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,I wish more game were like this! Totally satisfying to play!
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"If you are looking for a game that straddles the line between an experience and a game, it's hard to recommend one more than Outer Wilds. It's about 17-20 very immersive hours, with a very novel and enjoyable core concept. I highly recommend it if you enjoy exploration, puzzles, and uncovering mysteries through, effectively, archaeology. Oh and try to go in blind, it can be spoiled."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"At first I was hesitant to rate this game highly, because controls and movement are not very good and can very often be very frustrating. Also, some of the puzzles (two, to be precise) are
very abstruse (reminiscent of Myst) and i had to look up one of them because even now, i still don't understand how you're supposed to get and make this mental connection in the game. I really wonder how many people managed to find the solution without using guides or walkthroughs from the internet. But enough of that. Since everyone screams ""Best game ever"" and while I also think that this is the case, as i will elaborate further down below, i still think it is fair for potential buyers to warn them. It's nothing that would make this game unplayable, but it has, at least, to be adressed. 

And now on to the good parts. Of which there are plenty. 
Firstly, i want to say that it's a miracle how this game manages to avoid all the pitfalls and traps that so many Triple-A productions fall into. While so many games want to be like big-budget Hollywood films, this game embraces its interactive component and manages masterfully to lay out all its system in a way that only work in a game. Examples of other games that are not shy or afraid of being a video game would be ""999"" or ""Nier:Automata"", even if the last one has major caveats in it's presentation.

Playing this game really drove my attention on how much I loathe all those huge big budget triple A productions nowadays. Always the same tropes, the same old done-over-and-over-again stories and shallow, stereotypical, clichéd characters. The same gameplay systems that are made in a way so that even the dumbest consumer blinded by capitalistic advertisting and colorful E3 panels can waste his lifetime on. Outer Wilds is nothing of that. It doesn't have lootboxes or any kind of loot at all. You can play it exactly once (and i mean ""exactly once""). It has puzzles that are ranging for medium difficulty to stuff that is so far out there that you could spend days thinking about it. It has no multiplayer. It has no leveling or grinding or time-wasting game design. It's not a Discord-Twitch-Whatever game. Streams of this game are ruining the game and even if you already know all the stuff, they're boring. It is cheap. Only 20 bucks for a masterpiece like this while full-on garbage like Cyberpunk is 60 bucks is a tragedy.

And I am 100% serious here when i say that if you've got any interest or personal investment in video games as a medium of art and do not only want to blindly consume the next huge thing just to waste time and forget life around you, but instead want to see how this game manages to deliver an experience only an interactive medium could deliver and how it tells a story that only a game could tell, then read no further. In general, you shouldn't read anything about Outer Wilds. Going in blind is the best thing you can do. 

So, if it wasn't obvious enough by now, I have to rate ""Outer Wilds "" a full 10/10.

Made by a team of students, not by some billion-dollar company. Money can destroy creativity and artistry, and even if this game doesn't always work 100% (as described above), i can wholeheartedly say that you can feel every ounce of heartblood the developers put into it. Not because they wanted to be the next big thing in the video game industry. Not because they wanted to do stuff everyone else already does to rake in cash. This game exists in its current shape because people wanted to create art and make you feel something. This game has stories to tell. 
I am sad that there will probably never be anything else that comes close to the feels, the experiences and how this game can change your outlook on life. Outer Wilds is proof that video games
can be art. In fact, the final sequence in it's shining brilliance reminded me very strongly of a certain Stanley Kubrick film ;)

(And now back to playing all this time-wasting garbage like MOBAs or Shooters or whatever ...)

Seriously, go play this game."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"I'm not a hardcore cynic, but quite cynical nonetheless and cannot be surprised easily, yet his game gave me at least half a dozen WHAT THE ACTUAL F--- moments already, and I don't know if I'm close to halfway through it.

This game is terrific. 
And terrifying in a way no horror game can scare. 
And majestic. 
And truly mysterious. 
It's the ultimate ""I wish I could forget it so I can see it again for the first time"". I know that you may not wish to spend 20 bucks ""at random"", but this game is a MUST for everyone.

"
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Fantastic game, and would definitely recommend playing it. It's not perfect, and left me conflicted when it was over, but after sitting on it for a while I can say that I enjoyed it enough to give it an extremely positive ""yes"". The story was pretty intriguing and I liked the thought put into the reoccuring characters and extremely dense level design. Every single planet you visit has a purpose, and to beat the game you're going to have to have knowledge of at least half of them, so exploration is very encouraged and vital to beating the game. The mood of this game is also great when it wants to have it, this game has successfully made me jump further out of my chair than most horror games I've played in the past few years... which takes immense skill since the rest of the game is mostly upbeat and non-threatening. When I started the game, I was getting really motion sick from the spinning of the planets combined with the lander controls, but after I got used to it, it posed no problem. Just something to keep an eye out for though, if you get dizzy very easily you might have a rough time at the start.

The main problem I have with this game is the beginning. Once you get past the fact that your species of aliens looks like a Dreamworks Animated Film reject from 2006, you do a short tutorial bit that is honestly pretty good at explaining the complicated controls and weird mechanics this game has. But shortly after that, you go up to the observatory/museum building and promptly get half of the game spoiled to you by a few characters. You not only see what the titular alien race looks like, but also get a ""sneak preview"" of every single planet's gimmick and get told where all of the other astronauts are. There's a good deal of mystery left to find out in space, but it quite literally feels like half of the game was just given to me in the first ten minutes. In some ways, humanizing all these alien characters you talk with and giving you a bunch of info straight up helps the game be way more accessible to people not normally into exploration games, but personally as somebody who loves to explore secrets and dig into games like these I would have much preferred if the intro was cut back and your character remained silent. I don't need the cast of ""Mars Needs Moms"" to give me a reason to go to this giant spaceship orbiting the sun, I'm going to go there anyways!

I would go into what I liked about the game more to balance out this review, but I can't since literally everything is a spoiler. Just know there is very good writing at times and the level design of each planet is top tier. The game runs at around ten hours long, which is honestly the perfect length for video games considering how many are coming out these days. The ending is also really interesting, but I was still left with a feeling of ""oh. huh. ok. that was it, I guess"", presumably because of the bad pacing of the intro. 

If I had to sum up my experience of ""The Outer Wilds"", it's like a sandwich with really bad crust. The outside edges are terrible and I'll probably want to peel them off, but the middle is a delicious mix of swiss, ham and mayo that you never want to end."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Outer Wilds is the single greatest single-player game I've ever played, and an incredible masterclass in player-driven exploration. The solar system is teeming with stories to be uncovered, and while you don't need to learn them all to complete the game, the narrative will have you desperate to uncover every detail you can.

I will spoil nothing, and you should spoil nothing for yourself, because this game is best experienced blind and it has only a fraction of the impact if you know how it ends; which is a tragedy, because the ending made me emotional like no piece of art ever has.

I firmly believe every human being should play this game."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Outer Wilds is the best gaming experience I have ever had.  Truthfully, any words that I write won't do my thoughts and feelings, nor the game itself justice.  Do yourself a favor and experience one of the most captivating, heartwarming, scientifically accurate, and awe-inspiring examples of interactive story telling that has ever come to be."

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,It's a fun game to play either alone or with friends. It gets boring after a while though and it is too expensive for what it offers.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,"I'd love it if I could recommend this game to you people out there. I really do. But if they're going to charge 30 dollars for it, I can't morally tell anyone to buy it. This game is really fun... for the first 3-4 days. Once you get the initial hype out of it, the game just becomes repetetive and annoying. Once you get your first win, the game just becomes completely stale. Even with the new maps, I find myself playing cheap knockoffs more often than the actual game. For a ""chill"" game, most of the stages are just unreasonable punishing and extremely difficult to get any practice in. If you like that and have the budget, go ahead. But if you re just looking for a relaxing challenge to sink some hours into, this game is really just a waste of money. I did enjoy this game, but only for about 5 hours."

That is what i call overpay and a half, this game gets repetitive fast and it has simple graphics (Ik that's what the dev's were going for) that didn't take much effort to make, maps that didn't take much effort to make, skins that didn't take much effort to make, so why the fu- does this game cost 16 pounds??

This game died months ago yet they still charge 16 pounds.

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,"its too hard to find a match, disappointed"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,"The game as it stands is not worth $20. $5 maybe.

No free play mode (Stage select). No practice mode. No ability to make lobbies and play with only friends. It's fun for a single afternoon but after that it has an extremely short shelf life.

The fact that the game charges you $20 and then expects you to cough up more money for cosmetics that can only be bought with a premium currency is laughable. 

I'm not one for fanboy wars, but there's a reason why people still play/talk about Among Us and not this anymore. I would honestly ask for a refund if I could, but I played it for slightly over 3 hours and that's apparently too long to request a refund on a bad game according to Steam."

Overall is good. You have to play everyday to get rewards easier. Do the daily quests. Those tokens and crowns can use to buy cosmetics.  Background music and player sound effects make you cheerful.  

I hate how we are frozen at the starting line. We should be able to move freely and decide our starting position. It is unfair when we are at second or last row. Harder to be first to cross the line.

Teamwork game really depends on luck. I hope we can have 10s timer to decide which team we want. Choose our own fate. We can all rush to 3 different colored doors to choose our team. Just watch Korean variety show , Running Man , for more creative ideas.

We hope to see winner past achievements at the final stage. How many crowns he won.



Overall score :  B"

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,Maximum aggression engaged
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,"I am not used to write reviews, but this game took my attention and 33 hrs from my life ( and will take more for sure ) and here we are:
PROS:
- for all ages
- colorful, a lot of skins ( kinda...A LOT)
- enough maps and interesting systems of playing
- can play with friends
- can play in a 1-4 team
- free season pass with interesting things 
- easily obtainable kudos to buy things from shop
- very competitive, drove me crazy 20 times in 10 minutes
CONS:
- Music, i would like to hear different types of music
- I would like to pick the maps I want to play 
- I would like to be a show selector with an option for no team rounds ( permanently this time )
- Game feels annoying after a few rounds and you can be a little frustrated being so close to win ( happened to several times and I broke my keyboard, mouse, chair, a finger, and my mom) 

Overall 9/10, I enjoyed this game more than other games, a small masterpiece with heavy content and an unique system of playing 
P.S. Buy a second keyboard and a second controller because you will break em all"

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,"Skills yeah this game takes skills, jump, dive, grab, get smashed in the groin well falling into some slime letting yourself down as you got beat by a bunch of people with downs that collect the crowns. Play some squads and carry your retard friends that do not know how to press A. The best part of this game is watching two people with hacks wait out each other for the win as you had no chance to win cause there is nothing you can do vs the hackers you will find. If your pants are wet take them off, if you girl is wet get off this game."

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,shit game but a little fun
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,"It's not hot garbage but it isn't the worth the money that can be spent on something like Valheim, which is the same price but has far more content and can be played with a friend for hours on end. Fall Guys is something you'll play for an hour or two every now and then at best.

Many of the modes, including modes that decide who wins a match you've spent plenty of time on, punish players who have better connections. Players with US government secret agent connections pay the price for people who have toasters for routers and it's hot horseshit.

Many game-modes decide winners based upon sheer dumb luck or require you to depend on players you cannot communicate with whatsoever.

Some game type queues solve some problems by removing some modes, but no queue removes all problematic modes, and queues are on rotation, so if you find one you like, you won't have access to it for very long.

The game also has no pull to keep you invested, with the exception of the seasonal rewards trackers, which only unlock cosmetics which are incredibly restricted. Cosmetic content is also in a constant daily/weekly rotation in the store, which you can use earned currencies to purchase, with one of the two currency types being purchasable. Once an item is gone from the store, it's gone forever. It's exciting for players who get it because there's a certain level of exclusivity for the owner, but a terrible idea for the longevity of the game. It means that **an incredible majority of the cosmetic content in this game by tens of times is no longer accessible and will never be again**. This means the minimal long-term draw this game has to begin with is further diminished to the point that there's almost no reason to *continue* playing other than the gameplay; which sounds sensible, but the gameplay itself is incredibly repetitive despite its cartoony and fun style, it can be really frustrating, especially alone, due to its competitive nature by design.

This game is not worth full price. I would recommend buying this game at $10. That is how much it is worth to me and probably you, too."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,"It's Okay
"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,"The very definition of ADHD Zoomer casual trash to appeal to Generation Twitch Chat's hilariously low IQ. (Now with ugly, nonsensical skins, costumes and the same 6 maps repeated constantly like Rain Man's teatime routine.)

I bought this on day one and back then it was fun, for about 2 hours until you realised it's a one-trick pony with a tediously hollow core game experience that has about as much lasting appeal than your average free to play, Chinese smartphone game. 

Just fired it back up fort the first time since launch and I can't even complete a game due to players lagswitching the server and booting everyone out because a kid in a chicken outfit pushed them off a cyber roller and want to stop other players from getting their XP. This happened in 10 games consecutively until I couldn't be arsed anymore and uninstalled it.

Save your money and your time if you have any dignity, go and play a free mobile game instead. It's just as dull and laborious as wasting your time with this mind-numbing hackfest. Easily my biggest purchase mistake of the last 3 years.

At the moment many cheaters are in that game, hopefully will there be an faster report system to ban those players. All in all its a game that you can play with mates, if you dont know what to play.
      The premise is simple, race and fight your way to victory in order to retrieve the crown. It's rather addictive game which can leave you feeling like a ruling tyrant or going through all the stages of grief.

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,"Fall Guys is cute and fun but highly repetitive. To be honest, it feels like a game that wasn't designed because the creators had a vision of making a game that people would love, but rather, a vision of how to make  streamer/Youtube-bait and candycoat all the obnoxious trends of modern gaming like microtransactions, useless DLC, and ""seasons"". However, knowing that so many people are desensitized to these things and that my complaints about them will do nothing more than prompt ""old man shakes fist at cloud"" references, I'll put my cynicism aside and say this: there are worse ways to spend 20 bucks. I would love a practice mode that let me solo the levels, I would love to be able to filter out levels I dislike, and I would like the store to not have FOMO marketing tactics. I would also like it if Israel would stop killing Palestinians. Anyway, thumbs up for a fun game, thumbs down for ethnic cleansing poorly disguised as counter-terrorism."

Remember the hours you spent playing in your underwear and nothing else on, with your little bro with a bowl of cereal on the side? Remember those days? Well, you can say hello to nostalgia with this awesome game! This game is 100% inspired by Super Smash Brothers!!!  

This game provides great characters and the game is being updated constantly, which is awesome. The game provides awesome fighting levels. The game provides great combos/fighting mechanics, and lastly, the community is great!

Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition,Strategy,3590,"Plants vs. Zombies is quite the addictive tower defense game, where you protect the house from goofy-looking zombies, using a variety of flowers and varierty of plants, mushrooms and such. It's quite the relaxing game, and if well the adventure mode is short, it has a lot of replayability with the Adventure Mode replay mode, the Mini-Games, the Puzzle modes, Survival Mode, and also getting upgrades for plants and taking care of stuff at the Zen Garden for some pretty pennies. For a simple game, it has a lot of depth, and the variety of plants makes it open for various strategies.

The graphics are cartoony and vibrant, quite the charming game for his age. As for the music, it has a lot of catchy tunes, composed by Laura Shigihara, bringing a lot of the charm for the music composed for this game.

Do I recommend it? Absolutely! This is a modern classic that can be enjoyed for most people. Just make sure that to get the zombies off your lawn, will ya?"

And then eat the brains of
The one who planted me here

To make a lawn defense at any hour

Crazy Dave is a barrel of laughs, the tree of wisdom gives you some useful tips and the mini-games are thoroughly enjoyable. Nothing, however, compares to the euphoric extacy of the Zen Garden.
When you see a present drop from a recently felled zombie, there is a moment of pure pleasure, you've found a pot plant. After this all that will be on your mind for the remainder of the level will be, ""What plant shall I receive today"" as you grin from ear to ear. Taking it back and providing it the appropriate care really does quell your maternal instincts as the grin remains, a smile only obtainable from the joy of Zen Gardening.

Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition,Strategy,3590,all my progess is gone :)
Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition,Strategy,3590,"One of popcap's legendary titles, and for good reason. A great game that fails in so little areas they're more nitpicks than anything. (aside from maybe being unable to fast forward for more experienced players or to avoid any needless in game waiting.)
In spite such a small team, this game shows a very healthy usage of its core mechanics in a vast variety of ways, and oozes with the passion, love and care that was put into it. Play it if you haven't already, and with how cheap it is today its a remarkable steal just like hollow knight. I wish we got a proper sequel, EA's mediocre, mundane, uninspired and lazy pvz2 doesnt count."
Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition,Strategy,3590,This game slaps. No doubt about it.
Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition,Strategy,3590,"The good day when you have to worry about not that much little things miss those year 
this game is just a flash back about those day if you want you can buy the other game they made about this game in 3D first person shooter my brother love it it call (Plants versus Zombies Garden Warfare) 
That all I got to say
10/10 miss the good days"

Peggle Deluxe,Casual,3480,"This is simply the greatest video game ever created. No amount of verbal homage can express the amount of respect I feel towards this game and its practice. This game is definitely a practice, as in a discipline to progress in towards the path of mastery. The most exhilarating moment in this game is when the words ""EXTREME FEVER"" pop up on your screen. It's a taste like no other; incomparable to any high experienced through pitiable designer drugs or the most enduring and pleasurable sex. If no other pleasures in this world can truly satisfy a person, maybe Peggle™ can."
Peggle Deluxe,Casual,3480,Honestly groundbreaking and life changing. This game is a large part of my character I would even say soul.

Peggle Deluxe,Casual,3480,"game is well made and is quite the challenge at some points. its an all time PC classic, I loved it when i was but a lad and I still love it now"
Peggle Deluxe,Casual,3480,It's a fun time killer.
Peggle Deluxe,Casual,3480,pipipi
Peggle Deluxe,Casual,3480,I get Runtime and other various errors making the game crash/unplayable. Support links from the company no longer work and emails are undeliverable. I contacted EA (who I believe bought out the original company who created the game in 2007) but no support was offered. I requested a refund from Steam and was denied due to the amount of play time before the error appeared.

Muse Dash,Casual,774171,Wish they add custom song
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,yeah
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"Only 2.3 hours in and I can see myself playing way more of this. 

Play casually, or challenge yourself by meeting the level conditions in order to get the achievement(s) for the stage. Earning the stage achievement(s) seems to give you more experience than without earning them, and goes towards unlocking songs with each level up. Regardless of whether or not you actually get the stage achievement(s), you still earn experience, and you obtain miscellaneous items that are used to unlock characters, companions, etc.

If you've played rhythm games before, this game should be an easy adjustment from what you're used to. Highly recommend."
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"I fully recommend this awesome game to everyone. 
Muse Dash is a rhythm game featuring flashy visuals and mostly electronic music."
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"PROS:
-Great sync and flow to the maps
-Overall very fitting songs to the game
-The design of the game is mostly very nice

CONS:
-The style to unlock more songs and difficult songs
-Unnecessary fanservice that can leave an odd taste in your mouth should you stumble upon it.
-A lot of maps are restricted and you need to buy the DLC to get them, and that thing is EXPENSIVE

OVERALL:
A solid game overall that will give you lots of entertainment and satisfaction, but if I open the game to hear an anime girl moan ""peroperogaming"" again then I'm going to throw something

8/10"
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"Can the music live in your head rent free? Yes, yes it can. Is the art eye candy? Yes, yes it yes.

Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"rythams!!!!
"
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,I bought it for boobs but I guess this is cool too
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"I've been playing this game so much since I bought it, it's a super fun rythem game that's not too hard.

I mean, i'm bad at rythem games but this one looked fun so I decided to buy it and it's really fun, really recommend it."
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"If you're looking for a non-bland rhythm game, this is a must-try. Vibrant colors, exciting music, unusual music notes, and horizontal gameplay, are what made Muse Dash a unique rhythm game.

From my 15 hours of playing, Muse Dash is quite easy to get a grasp since it only has 2 lines of notes, but quite difficult to master, especially the speed and patterns in higher difficulties. There are up to 3 difficulties in a single song, which leaves you no worries of not being able to complete your favorite song.

It might take quite a time to get used to the game due to its unusual music notes and horizontal gameplay. Also, high refresh rate monitors (120Hz+) are recommended.

For the cons, the game has specific characters and elfins (a creature floating next to the character) which can help boost your score. Simply, the score isn't solely based on your ability, but also the character and elfin selection, which is the feature I quite dislike.

I also hope for the game to make more use of the Steam features not just putting the game up in the store, for example, Steam achievements, collectible cards, and ranking between friends.

Overall, Muse Dash is really an exciting game with many pros and a cheap price that anyone can try. If you really love the game, there is a DLC for you to pick up, which helps you level up faster, unlocks tons of more songs, and a few characters."
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,loli run from the police
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"I love this game it's very simple rythm game with 2 bottoms 
I wish if there is custom songs like in osu, Muse Dash songs are nice tho"
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"Stumble upon this Game from Watching Gura Playing and WOW not expecting a Rhythm Game someone with bad Vision can Enjoy. Compare to other Rhythm Games this game is Simple to Learn. Tunes are Catchy af, good to Brighten up my Mood in this Depressing Time. Highly Recommended :3"
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"this game is good

fun

ok"
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"The game has a really nice art style that is unique and a nice color pallete. The gameplay is basically like osu taiko mode but on drugs. It plays the same except it separates the colored hits into two different lines (top and bottom) so you can read it more easily. Except this also adds more difficulty in the later stages. It also shakes up the difficulty with notes that show up very fast, so you have to have good timing/rhythm, and notes that dissapear (kinda like osu hidden but only on very few notes per song and you can't toggle and play full hidden).

Overall the game is very rewarding if you're really into rhythm and it gives you lots of unlockables to keep you grinding and playing songs. 

For the base game price it is absolutely worth it if you're interested by anything you saw. Just buy it you will have lots of songs to play. If you then really like the songs you can get the season pass to get DLC songs and all DLC songs in the future. Compared to an open community game this game only has songs the devs decide to put in so play the base game for dirt cheap and if you still like the mechanics and the songs you heard in the base game you can listen to the unlockable DLC too and decide if you like the music enough to get it."
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"This games quite fun and a little bit difficult because it's testing you're movement speed, brain, eyes"
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"Great rhythm game as they constantly update new songs and so on. However, banning hololive members to stream this game is upsetting for holofans.

Still a great game nonetheless."

Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"Fun casual rhythm game to waste a bit of time on. Easy to get into, but still very challenging at the higher difficulties."
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,Amazing and addicting rhythm game with banger songs and cute anime girls. What more could you ask for?

Senren＊Banka,Casual,1144400,"Senren * Banka is pretty easy game to clear, which is made easier with a flow-chart. On the other hand, the game did feel a bit longer than normal. Whether that was due to it actually being longer or from me getting bored out of my head, no one will know. Some of them was good and bad. 

Overall, Senren Banka was a good game with an overall decent efforts to explain the story to the readers, In previous Yususoft title, Sanoba Witch is much better compared to this one."

Insaniquarium Deluxe,Casual,3320,9 year old me played this game for hours
Insaniquarium Deluxe,Casual,3320,"At first, I only bought this game because I played it as a kid. Then, when I started playing it I realized how much I enjoyed it despite the nostalgia. The soundtrack is amazing, the fish tanks are kept fresh and fun, the game-play is repetitive... in a good way though. I really suggest this game to people who just want to have fun, you can be bad at this game and it'll still be entertaining. My only complaint about the game would be the fact that in the later stages of the game, it takes FOREVER to complete the levels. overall, great game."
Insaniquarium Deluxe,Casual,3320,very nostalgic
Insaniquarium Deluxe,Casual,3320,"This games simple but great. Raise fish to get money from their poop, and once you got enough money you can buy eggs witch hatch into pets! The satisfaction of getting all the eggs is worth it. Its a game I grew up playing so coming back here and playing it again was such sweet nostalgia. It's worth a try, if you want something not to complicated and relaxing."
Insaniquarium Deluxe,Casual,3320,Playing this back on a Windows 98 in a library when I was like 7 felt amazing.
Insaniquarium Deluxe,Casual,3320,"Not a day goes by where i dont think about this game. it has impacted my life in more ways than one. night after night i coom myself thinking about prego the mother fish. why has capcom forsaken me by introducing me to this heavenly creature. forcing me to live my life knowing i will never knock up the milf fish. what and absolutely stunning fish. my only dommy mommy. soon i will join my beloved in the afterlife where i will be a chad carnivore while prego spreads her clasper fins and lets me spread my seed as i was unable to in this life. soon.
8/10 its pretty good, cant minimize it or it crashes"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Dear PowerWash Simulator Devs,
This is a very simple concept that is pulled off well. Thanks for a great start.

Now, I'm just some dude, but it is my belief that if you added a *public, user-rated level-editor*, you would never have to work another day in your lives.

Best of luck!"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"i work as a power washer for a living, why did i buy this"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Probably the most realistic Dad simulator I've ever played. You wash dirty things and at the end they come out clean. And then you get money and a gif of you cleaning the thing. Simple. Clean. Satisfying.
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Why are you reading reviews for Power Wash Simulator? The moment you saw there was a game about Power Washing, you knew if you wanted this game or not, and whichever of those you are, you're 100% right.
I knew instantly I would love it, and I do."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"This game is great for when you need to sit back and let your ADHD brain experience something soothing and something you can completely sink into. Similar feeling to using a real power washer or watching a video of one. I am a completionist myself and I speed through games like nobody's business; however, for some maps it takes me days to complete. It makes me want to take a break and come back to it the next day and most games can't hold my attention like that. Once again def get this game."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"a great game to play while listening to podcasts, also highly satisfying

PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Ok so when I first went to purchase this I thought it's gonna be one of those sims I spend 10 mins in and get bored but its 6 hours in and I can't get enough! haha.  The premise is simple you have to Jet Wash random things from motorbikes to giant houses and you'd think that sounds really boring but it's actually really fun!  The graphics are awesome, the effect of the water cleaning stuff on different surfaces is really cool, being able to upgrade your Jet with different parts and is cool, but the best part is most definitely the feeling of accomplishment you get when you hear the 'ding' after finishing a section."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"If you enjoyed the cleaning portion of House Flipper, I think you would like this game. It's very fun and relaxing. It's the perfect game to play while listening to a podcast. And it's very satisfying seeing the stuff you clean become nice and shiny."

Definitely recommend to anyone who likes longform satisfying gameplay."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Few minor bugs here and there, like the rotation icon being wrong sometimes. Other than that I recommend this 100%, pure relaxing and stress free. That and you can draw giant dangus' wherever you want."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Hei all!

It's been a while from my last game review, but honestly this does deserve one. I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I turned on the simulator. I mean let's be real, what can you expect from a washing simulator, I can't even get my lazy butt to clean my own home, not to mention doing it in game.

Man was I wrong. This game is soooooo good at stress relief and it was amazingly relaxing. I mean it actually reminded me little kids coloring books. Just Instead of colors you had to remove dirt for things to come alive. Just felt so fulfilling. You get hired to clean different things from cars to bikes to houses to playgrounds. You finish the job, get paid, buy better equipment and soaps and clean even harder and faster. 

Couple things what I missed, that I felt should be added to the game.
1) Tutorial. I mean the button screen is helpful, but it felt like it was missing something. I got thrown into the game, START CLEANING. If I wouldn't have seen a youtube clip on the game, I wouldn't have known that you can rotate the front end or even change the tips. 
2) Things got real really fast xD. From cleaning the first car to going to a bloody mansion as the second job. I mean jeesh. Maybe a wee bit of a smaller object can be put to works for the second workorder :)
3) As this is really enjoyable, but a wee bit short, it could use both more workorders and steam achievements

Anyways those were my 2 cents. I do recommend the game. It was quite enjoyable :D"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"I try not to buy games that release into Early Access, but I just couldn't resist with this one. I'm glad that I bought it, too! There's a pretty great amount of content despite its current 2-week-long life span, gameplay is satisfying, and there are little details that got a few chuckles out of me. 

My sole criticism is just voicing how disappointed I was to learn that the different cleaners were just for rapid removal and were not a solution that foamed or made bubbles. Or maybe I have watched too many Detail Geek videos. Who's to say?

So if you are oddly satisfied by cleaning and/or powerwashing, love to watch videos of it, often find yourself browsing r/powerwashingporn... this is the game for you!"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Great game for de-stressing
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Solid execution. Can't wait for PvP.

but for real, very relaxing game. I've just been watching streams and playoff sports while tossing this on in the background and its been a vibe. 10/10"

PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,stinky butt butt
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"It may be early access and admittedly I haven't read up on how many gameplay features they intend to add...

But dang if it isn't already fulfilling my every emotional need as it is..."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"if only i could powerwash the sins of my past away

"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"The game is alright. I enjoy it, however, there are a couple of quirks here and there, as any game would have in early access. Some things I wish would change is that:

-You could hold Tab to see where the dirt is, rather than having to re-tap ""Tab"" to have it show up again. Or alternatively, some sort of ""Dirt Vision"" option that lets you see the dirt at all times.
-In tandem with the aforementioned, a ""Complete Job"" option if you're at 99% completion and you are struggling to figure out where the last bit of dirt is located at.
-A flashlight would also be rather nice to have in certain darker areas where you could use it to perhaps see if there's dirt underneath things or such

Currently, I am stuck on the 1st/2nd(?) level, the backyard, and can't progress because I cannot find the last bit of dirt and there's none of the options I mentioned above. Other than that, the game /can/ be a bit tedious with how much time it takes to complete certain jobs (the backyard level taking me almost 3 hours to complete before getting to the state I am currently), but it is kind of relaxing a bit to just spray water everywhere without having to worry about how much water you've totally wasted. 

Overall, I like the game, and it has a lot of potential. It is very entertaining and calming, at least when you're not frustrated trying to figure out where the last bit of dirt is, haha. Would recommend, especially if Multi-player comes into fruition."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,very relaxing
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"I spent $20 on a PowerWashing Simulator, I don't regret it."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"This game is just fun. Addictive. Cathartic. You would think it gets boring, but truly, its just a great way to spend free time doing mindless stuff.

I swear, it actually helps me de-stress.

Get it, if you can. Totally worth it."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"hehe power washer go pshhhhhhhhh


hope to see more levels in this game. Beat all of them in just 10 hours."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"I honestly thought it was a joke of a game until my friend streamed it to me on discord, who found it through SMII7Y on YouTube. I'm subbed to him so idk how I missed it.

It's therapeutic. Strangely therapeutic. Your only task is to clean lol. There's no timer, no race to the finish. Just you, the power washer, the ambient noise of your surroundings and dirty parts of a yard/playground/car. I streamed this game on twitch for lolz and a majority of the time I was so quiet because I was focused on cleaning every little fucking detail. It bothered me if I saw a yellow spot that I had missed. So, 10/10. For a game that's in early access, this was definitely thought out and developed carefully. Looking forward to future updates. Thanks for making a great stress reliever of a game for those shitty days after work!"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,A lovely and relaxing time cleaning. Excited for more and more to get added!
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"As someone who collects mental illnesses like Pokemon, this game has been a revelation. Relaxing, fun, and something that can be done at my own pace. So happy I bought this game"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Successfully delivered more satisfaction than 98% of the ""NSFW"" category combined.

11/10 would clean again."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Jerma brought me here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Hi, I'm Barry Scott, This isn't Cillit Bang, But it is the next best thing. Bang, And the Covid is Gone."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Chill, satisfying, and open for so much growth"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Great cleaning game simulator. If you like viscera and house flipper this is a game for you!
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Weirdly addicting
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Very fun, looking forward to more content in future updates!"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Sometimes as you're browsing, a game just catches your eye for being unusual or ridiculous in concept.  Usually it ends up as nothing more than a mirage of disappointment, but PowerWash Simulator is exactly as it advertises itself.  If I had to sum it up in one word, it's... cathartic.  I was having a monumentally bad weekend with the kind of events that could shatter even the strongest of spirits.  This helped me get through and let me process things as I methodically tackled the property of some particularly dirty residents.  After completing all of the currently available content (about 13 to 14 hours worth) I am so looking forward to every update and new piece of content in the future.  The subtle, quirky charm and chirps from the residents as you progress on your jobs is an excellent touch that brings character to a town that could easily get away with being lifeless.

Some friendly advice: don't bother with soap until either more difficult jobs arrive, or the system is reworked.  Save up the money from your first 5 or so jobs and splurge for the best washer, it's all you really need."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,much less tedious gameplay than viscera cleanup detail. would recommend if you like cleaning or are just generally mesmerized by flowing water
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Relaxing and satisfying to wash away the dirt and grime.  Needs more levels tho, I finished in a few days."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"This game inspired me to dig out my old power washer. Turns out it was broken, so I went back to playing the game instead.

10/10 Actually better than real life"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Fun chill game.
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Satisfying and almost too realistic
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,dad approved
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"having a blast with the game, as an early access title its very well polished.
its very relaxing but also addicting. i can feel the dopamine when playing this.
i tried 'Viscera Cleanup Detail' and not work for me but this one just hit the spot.
--------
when it comes to simulator i would really like to see two mechanics:
1. when you wash items in higher ground, sewage should mess up lower ground.
2. when walking backward on dirty floor, the footprint should mess up the clean floor.
but seems thats no easy to implement.
-----------
that being said the game is really great, wholeheartedly recommended"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Dude, this game is one of the best ways for me to unwind at the end of the day now. 

Smoke up, power wash to some music, and i can just step away if i need to get a snack or something.

Truly a masterpiece already so early in this stage!"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,better than sex.
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,i like seeing the dirt go away
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Very relaxing, overall enjoyable to play"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,I don't write reviews. I'm writing a review for this game because I love it.
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"When it says there's currently 5 hours of gameplay, there's actually closer to 20. This reminds me of Car Mechanic Simulator in that ""just one more"" turns into a 5-8 hour session of zoning out to repeated motions and satisfying visuals. Since this just came out for early access I assume there's a ton more content and I will definitely be coming back to this with every update. Maybe not currently worth $20, maybe closer to $15, but with the fact that there's more on the way I feel pleased with this purchase."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,I finished the game in 19 hours. It was worth every penny.
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"the only way i can realy describe this game is 
remember that feeling when mario sunshine came out and u spent ages cleaning up waaayyy more goop then was needes and there was that sence of calming satisfaction and zen
this whole game is built around that
there is no challenge but there is not ment to be
this is a great game to unwind with or if ur watching somthing and just want somthing more then say a clicker it fills a void in the gaming world a nice zen low brain power game that u can half focus on 
honistly thanks so much for making this"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Very pog
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,literally better than sex
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Lost track of time and was pressure washing for about 2 hours without blinking.
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Got dick stuck in powerwasher directions not clear
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,You wash
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,wter
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"This game is helping me with my anxiety. If I feel like I might start panicking, booting this up and cleaning helps calm me down. Even when a tiny bit is left and difficult to find, it doesn't cause me a ton of stress. Great job!"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"[b]This game is the perfect fusion between mindless work and therapeutic brain-drain.[/b]

Imagine a world in which EVERYTHING is dirty and YOU, a humanoid biped with the power to lift a four stories tall scaffolding tower with ONE HAND... are the only hope for everyone in your town, to get rid of the dirt!

Embark on an epic adventure, clean shit for people who neglected basic hygene protocol for YEARS prior and pull them out of their crusted, muddied, disgustingly deteriorated homes! Plow your way through tons and tons of dirt, never use the white nozzle, because it's plain useless, panic as you realise you are out of money and still have to buy metal cleaner and then fulfill your destiny and become no one other but THE CLEANER OF THE UNIVERSE!!!!!

5/5 addicting, fun and so satisfying, but holy hell, someone make that white nozzle useful, because in 18 hours of gameplay I used it like... twice."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"I have never reviewed a game because it has never crossed my mind that it warranted putting time into writing one... then i spent 5 hours in a simulated setting powerwashing a go-kart and a playground.

10/10"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Possibly the best game I've ever played, and can sit on this game for hours at a time pressure washing away the misery of life. 10/10 worth the $22 CAD and you should buy it NOW"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Great game, 10/10. Needs multiplayer battle royal for optimal gameplay opportunities."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"it took my wife and kids, this game took everything from me.... But its so sparkly, i cant stop. please give me more to clean, this is my only true serotonin. I have found Valhalla through this game."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"eh, is aight
"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Says what it says on the tin. PowerWash Simulator is a different game with almost therapeutic quality. At the time of writing this review i have completed 4 campaign levels and each level grows the complexity of the situation on hand. My only quip with this game is that on occasion there are difficult to access areas to clean. Enjoy a new type of game with its uniqueness. Would have been nice if there would be some music in the background because the swishing of the water nozzle can irritate over a longer period of time.
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Mindless fun. Put on music and power wash! Can be tedious trying to find the last dirty spots. Overall 8 out of 10.
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"For years I've been waiting for a game that just makes me FEEL like I'm a guy with a power washer, and this game really delivered. The story is riveting and the graphics rival that of the next Battlefield game. I've never played a game as intense and engaging as this. Truly an addiction I never want to go to rehab for."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,bad
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,soapy water go brrrrrrr
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Its a fun game, very relaxing. The only problem I have with it right now is on some levels its hard to find spots you missed and having to walk around looking can be annoying. You can press tab to make the dirt show up bright orange for a sec but I'm stuck at 99% done on one of the house levels and cannot find where the last bit of dirt is. I've walked around spamming tab and went around spraying everything again and still cannot find it. ((edit) Finally found the dirt and finished the level) Would be cool if the whole part you missed would flash orange and not just the dirt."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,chill
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,it strokes my ocd just right
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"This game allows me to chill like no other game. I love playing games like Viscera: Cleanup Detail and House Flipper, but the part about those games I enjoy the most is the cleaning/mopping. This game allows me to do my favorite task, and it's the only task!

Give this game a try if you need to relax and not think about the world."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,mmm clean
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Got this game to play ironically on a stream one night but now I just like to get stoned and listen to weird history podcasts while playing it, 10/10"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"I found a glitch that makes you super jump and send me so high I had to take a screenshot but I like the game even though there is this glitch
"
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,Fun time for all love the game I'm excited to see the future of this game!
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,lets me feel like i'm being productive with my life 10/10
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"If you were the type of person to clean the whole map before doing the objective in Super Mario Sunshine, this game is for you."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Ksssssssst, pretty much sums it up."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,tssss ts tsss tsss tsss ts ts tssssss
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"This is the Ultimate dad game. Many hours of yelling at how dirty other people leave their stuff and tell yourself and others around you that you would never let your car, backyard or other objects/areas get this dirty."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,best game of all time

PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"TIP: Stuck at 99%? Use the Details Menu!

I ended up grabbing this game when it came out, I've played similar games before like House Flipper and Viscera Clean up. I finished the game within a couple days, I might've enjoyed it too much. It's really relaxing and really nice to play while you're doing other things like watching your favourite TV Series. I've had no issues at all with the game either, it's so satisfying when you've cleaned an area, that skate park looks beautiful."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"Water go fast, and carpal tunnel syndrome go faster."
PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,A fantastically satisfying cleaning experience that can whisk you away from lifes problems and allow you to focus on one thing. Cleaning some dirty shit.

Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,10/10 Game Dev and Simulation is a great combo - Average Gamer
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"i will make ubisoft games withtout bugs 
and i will make gta 6 and half life 3"
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,tbh there's not much to say. You develop games. You can choose genres and platforms.  You can follow wiki's combos if you don't want to test them out yourselves. Make money and build up your fan base. Solid time killer 👍
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"I've played this game for far longer than 4 hours before I purchased it here (cough). The game is good in theory, but the disconnect between what the game appears to be about (trying to make good games while balancing your time and budget) and is actually about (trying to maximize the difference in quality between the games you make) is incredibly disorienting and frustrating.

Ironically, my first few playthroughs were far more successful than my more recent playthroughs because I got better at making games as the campaign progressed, but once I was able to make a perfect games every time and for lest cost I started getting terrible reviews for every game I made and going bankrupt.

This is because there is no in-game market which your games are compared against, only your own. So, if you make good games early on, your first game will get good reviews and all subsequent games will get mediocre and progressively-worse reviews. If you improve the quality of your games incrementally, this will not outweigh the bad reviews, until you slowly go bankrupt. The game essentially forces you to make bad games and release quality improvements slowly, even if you're capable of doing tons better.

So, basically I find this game very frustrating to play because the way the game expects you to play is so different from the way which is both most intuitive, and in my opinion, the most fun to play. I would recommend against buying or playing it. If you disagree, that's fine, but I'm leaving my review nonetheless in hopes of warning any potential future players."
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"This game is great, but provides some ridiculous expectations. While helming my company, Speed Racist, I hired a few programmers that were apparent morons who had never seen computers before. I had to pay these bags of idiocy $35,000 a month just to have a functioning studio. As someone who's worked in the industry, you can put an entire QA team in indentured servitude for a whole year for this amount - just ask CD Project Red.

Additionally, my first game, the dancing simulation wonder Dance France Revolution, had underwhelming sales. I assigned perfect sliders and marketed exclusively to rebellious teenagers trying to break their puritanical roots, but it still flopped. Frankly, I can't fathom a time and place this game wouldn't be a resounding success.

My next foray into gaming, NBA 0K: Christ Rises 4 the Jam, also flopped. Again, due to the considerable idiocy of my team, who spent literal weeks scratching their heads, we scored a solid 3/10 on a genuine gold mine of a franchise. If 2K has taught me anything, it's that it takes no effort to make a sequel to a sports game. 

Overall, it's a fun but frustrating simulation. Obviously, it mimics game development 100%, so if you can succeed at this game you can make a game dev studio. I recommend that we all spend our entire life savings making a game studio that develops game development simulations development. It's a guaranteed success - I know this because my attempt at it scored an 11/10 in Game Dev Tycoon."
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"Quite fun. With plenty of opportunity to test out a different genres and mix them up in the weirdest of ways, a nice way exploring the game developers world. There's plenty of stuffs to do, even after you get the ""victory"" message. Definitely recommended."
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"Fun game, you can tell it was made with love."
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"play game make game big game

money make

yeeeeee 

good game"
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"Buy it
Now
I bet you have 10 dollars lying around so buy it.
IT'S SUCH A GOOD GAME!"
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,A funny and...interesting one. The game reminds me the Reigns series but better. 100% worth the price!
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"My most sold game was "" The Sims in my butt 2""

 2.5 million copies sold"
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,the weird thing about this game is you get an achievement by buying the game and only 97 percent of people who own the game have the achievement wtf?
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,Game Dev and Simulation is a great combination.
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"Ok-ish but underwhelmed after seeing this game has a review level of ""overwhelming"". Very basic gameplay whereby you need to find the right balance of maybe 5 to 6 variables. Will give it a ""positive"" rating for now but only because i bought it heavily discounted."
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"Super fun. Takes some effort to figure out where to allocate your attention when making games and as you begin unlocking research to try new genres or combinations of them or new technology in general you'll find that if you want good results you'll need to do more than just point, click, and wait. Love the love put in to this game. I give this game a solid A out of 5. If you like the tycoon genre give it a try."
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"This game is amazingly fun when you have a creative side. it isn't long but it isn't short either. You can have a lot of fun trying to get better reviews and scores. It's considerably one of the funniest small games I've played in a long time. To the developers, your game is extremely well made. Although, I wish you could have a longer story span. Reaching over 70 or 100 years. It would be cool to see new workers come as go as time goes by as well as new owners. That's only my opinion though. The game could use a few newer ways. Like be able to develop technology even further than what the game allows. The game can be stale at times with the repetitiveness but because it's such a small game with a small developer, it's promising nonetheless. Thank you for an amazing experience. I will be playing this for days on end in the future <3"
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"I pirated this game (then bought it)

good game"
Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"I have never had so much fun increasing sliders and watching numbers go up.


This game focuses on simple mechanics. You simply put your limited time/resources into focusing on certain aspects of a game which depends on the genre/topic combination. The correct/appealing combinations are generally intuitive to real life, as making an action game with no graphics but a good story is probably gonna be a flop. You have to balance skill/time/money with features and quality. (Features where you decide ""hmm open world or in game economy?""). All of this combines to bring about a really enjoyable experience, and really nails down the point ""you cannot make a game everything.""

Balancing game creation with research is a great balancing act. In-between developing games, you can decide to research certain game features over others, gaining the ability to incorporate it into a gaming engine. You can maximize your time by specializing your research and engines to have features for specific genres and topics (Genres being casual/action/RPG and topics being horror/expeditions/superheros). It also slightly punishes you for being focused on singular topics, as repeating the same old games will get negative reviews, but more than that, it hurts your staff from gaining experience. It all results in an engaging balancing act that encourages your company to focus on specific types of games while trying to explore new ground.

Company building in this game is satisfying, but I was left with wanting more. As you get bigger and better, so does the technology and your competitors. You have to get skilled staff in order to keep up, while also paying them six figure salaries for said staff. You will gradually grow you business to have new tech and offices, even starting your own RnD department to research tech no one has or developing your own hardware. During the later game, I was left with wanting more, to grow my company further. Moreover, the extra departments you only get right when the game ends and the tech advances slow to a halt. Moreover, the mechanics of each department are ""Invest x money and it goes faster"" which is not very satisfying, I was left with wanting more, but it is nice to have what you get.

Bye no means is the game ""10 out of 10, now take my money, all of it."" It will seriously lag when you get four employees, and this is a 2d sim game on my beefcake computer. Moreover, the reviews and little story events eventually become ""click here to gain risk/bonus."" I wish there were more story events to keep me engaged and feeling immersed while I watch little number bubbles tick up to finish a game. There was a lot of potential here and the lack of the story makes this game fall short of the Russian border guard sim ""Papers, Please"" Now, I was not expecting as good of a story or events, but it would have been nice, instead of min-maxing events that have a correct/incorrect answer. Say there is a reviewer that comes along and shits on your game for no reason, or that a competitor copies your game, hurting your sales, and you have branching decisions to deal with. Being now a master gamer developer myself, it does not seem hard to add it with some lines of text and/ codes for debuffs.

Overall, this game is not expensive and is an engaging but simplistic. It does not look like much in the screenshots, but you will generally feel like you are developing video games.

Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,u really get to play golf with ur friends but i spend most the time spectating as im the greatest and always get my ball in first
Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,"If you play without collision, You don't deserve to win ;)"
Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,"I normally don't comment on any forums, but I feel this amount of frustration can be taken care of being hopefully reaching the developers. 

While I love this game, and spend lots of hours practising, but it seems the game has a lot to do with lucky and skill. I can take criticism time and time again and improve my scores only so much on a recognised course, but I fail to see how some unthinkable score cards are a reflection of my ability to play your game. We all have very basic access to the likely basic controls of the game.

This has led me to understand and notice some understandable yet doable updates. 
1. Improve the speed at which we painlessly can watch our ball roll to any place on the map that isn't in the hole. Yes this would include out of bounds areas that auto glitch to last play position. I am aware there are sweet points off grid course. I don't need to see it roll along...or float...I know this is possible as older games have it. Just a thought. please.

2. More direction on the course. You offer a brief ability to skim the course ahead. 15 sec. In many cases this is not long enough for me. In turn, I fail to get an appropriate angle at a shot. Assuming I haven't used all my view time. If there is a way to keep the flag option on during play that would make a huge difference.

3. The roll and bounce of the ball is a little too much. I'm not sure if there will or can be settings which would allow for more realistic bounce. Its a little tricky to gauge the need of shot at times. Even with the meter level reader. The problem may be in the environment settings and not the game play. Shot which roll in different points of any course have varying effects. Not sure if a settings open in general can be added to reduce realistic values if this is a standard mode. Perhaps a more relaxed version.

4. Great game Overall. I would enjoy it more if it had more holes by steam as well. Super awesome this came out. A nice way to sit back and hound away at a ball. or Puck. Golf With your Friends 2 will be great with all the other suggestions i've seen. The workshop has been a blast to play. 

Way to go developers. Solid efforts indeed. 4.5/5"
Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,"Best golf game I've played. The power, and direction is 100% predictable so for many holes you could just memorize the hole in one tricks. For people who don't spend every hour of every day ruining a nice casual game though, this game is very many hours of fun. I don't personally like the single player, but with friends I don't think I'll ever lose a taste for a lil gwyf."
Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,"A lot of room for improvements, one of them being globally able to search lobbies and quick play with anyone over the world, the servers currently are dead and there are barely any players in them, if you are lucky quick play will rarely get you into a game with a single player, the game also isn't cross play, I cannot play with my friends on xbox while I am on a PC, which is a bummer since this is on game pass."
Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,this game sux :^)

Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,Fun Party Game to play with friends and get very chaotic with collision but generally some good fun excited to try some of the other modes in the future besides classic like dunk mode for example.
Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,Wow what a game. Theres many goods and bads in life. For example the other day i was driving down the road and missed my turn and then almost got rear ended by a large white women in a honda accord. BAD. But when i came home i got to play this masterpiece of a game. GOOD.
Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,I only suggest you play this if a friend of yours has it or you really like golfing
Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,"Cool fun game, I hate real golf but this is nothing like that boring crap, this is fun"
Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,"Honestly I do not recommend this game. It's buggy and half of the maps have walls that don't abide by the laws of physics. This game is rage inducing and I'm normally a calm person but this game has made me want to volley my computer into a river on several separate occasions. It's only really fun when you're drunk and even then it's only fun because the drinking game that we came up with gets us drunk and fast. 

Only reason I downloaded this game instead of Golf It! is because it's available on mac and Golf It! isn't, otherwise I'd recommend that over this game.

Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,"Very casual, great for laid back fun with friends. The game is pretty stable and they have made lots of improvements from when i first bought it. Partying up works well and is easy. You no longer need to make a password for a lobby and share it with your friends. You can just have a friend make a lobby right click their name and join. Lots of fun cosmetic items and the user generated maps give a lot of replay value."

The game rewards you for being a pussy, so if youre a fucking pussy boom here you go, but you're gonna need to get your pussy ass friends to play with you because the only person playing the game is ESTAWARIES3294982 from Afghanistan. I fucking hate this game, I wouldnt pay two fucking dollars for this shit but i fucking did and i regret it 1000% i'd rather open a csgo case and get a 7 cent blue than play this fucking game ever again.

And if you ever need a kind word after a bad day, or a bad few days, or a bad few weeks, or a bad few months, you'll get that and then some.

Kind Words (lo fi chill beats to write to),Casual,1070710,A game about the human condition. We all have it . Chill Music and feels. You will know if its for you by the description alone .
Kind Words (lo fi chill beats to write to),Casual,1070710,"Kind Words made me feel very special when I first launched it. I had never seen a place on the Internet where everyone was so nice and friendly while also remaining completely anonymous. Most of us know from first-hand experience that anonymity tends to bring forth the worst in people, but something about this app keeps the vile and the bitter at bay. Suffice it to say that I [i]almost[/i] shed a single manly tear while going through paper aeroplane letters with simple encouragements and words of wisdom. This was a special moment; I was thinking to myself that I'd found the ultimate way of spending my free time – writing supportive letters to strangers, asking for advice and guidance myself, using screensavers with chill lo-fi music while I'm working or studying. However, what felt like love turned out to be a mere infatuation that died as quickly as it had come – four hours later it was gone without a trace. If you look at other reviewers, you will notice a similar trend.

[h1]Why?[/h1]

Well, ask yourself: [b]do you [i]actually[/i] need Kind Words?[/b] I mean, have you got something gnawing away at your heart, something that keeps you awake at night, the burden you want to get off your chest? Maybe the stuff that you wouldn't share with your dearest friend or even your loved ones for fear of judgement or ridicule? Do you have any mental health issues; are you depressed? If so, then this application might be just the right thing for you, and it's the main reason I recommend it. However, I'm happy to say that I don't really need any help or words of support; I'm doing all right, have been for a long time now, and I'm planning to keep it that way. The only option for me (and for many of you as well, I suppose) would then be to respond to requests submitted by those whom I described above. This might be very rewarding for a couple of hours and you might feel like you're actually making a bit of a difference, but...
[list]

[*]...the requests are a mess. [i]""What's your favourite band/videogame/book?"", ""Tell me about something good/bad that happened to you today"", ""I want stickers, send me stickers!"", ""Tell me a joke – looking to laugh out loud!""[/i] – these are so common that sifting through the list gets a bit frustrating at times. People forget that Kind Words is not supposed to be a run-of-the-mill chat app, but a safe space for those who are struggling. Problems don't end there; if you are hurting and you want to submit a request, you're only allowed to do so in a very limited number of lines. This drives many people to send multiple requests as parts of one story and give them numbers: 1/3, 2/3, 3/3... Unfortunately, you view a random selection of requests in no particular order, and oftentimes stumble upon a ""2/3"" with no way of knowing what the person is talking about as there is no way to read neither the beginning nor the end of it;

[*]...your letters can only be 14 lines long, and the influence of this limitation is tremendous. I understand that the developers made a conscious choice here and I see why they would do that – no need to write a scientific thesis in reply to a simple request asking for a piece of advice – but what I've found is that this restriction kills the uniqueness of each letter and stifles its potential impact. Most things you'll send are bound to be generic [i]""Don't worry, it'll be all right"".[/i] [u]The person who's hurting is not allowed to express their feelings completely,[/u] thus forced to send multiple requests and have their voices not be heard, and [u]you're barely able to offer anything other than a few watery clichés,[/u] those hang ons and stay strongs, with very few exceptions.
[/list]

By and large, if you're doing fine and life is good, Kind Words will test the very nature of your supposed altruism. Are you able to put up with these things that turned me away so fast? Maybe. But I still think that if you want to [b][i]give[/i][/b], you also need to be able to [b][i]receive[/i][/b] in return – at least that's how I believe it works with most people. Only replying to requests and not leaving any will create an imbalance, the feeling of an annoying chore which is bound to get old fairly quickly, and the issues I told you about won't make it any easier. Keep this in mind when you decide to purchase. 

However, if it takes everything that you have to face the day, if you feel like a disappointment, if your heart is broken, if your loved one is sick – there is probably no better virtual place you can be, even with all its shortcomings. Nothing beats professional help, of course, but Kind Words comes to your aid if seeking counsel is not an option.

I loved the soundtrack and the story and everything about the game, and although I'm yet to 100% the game, it's still a game that I can't help but to say it's one of, if not, it is my favorite game I've ever played. I look forward to getting to play the next game once it's released but I can't really say there's nothing wrong with the game. The story did make me tear up a bit, but that was okay.

VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"i love jill, i admire jill, i wanna be jill"
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"-I bought this game and played it YEARS ago. It was featured a lot at the 2016 vidya gaem awards and I though it looked really cute. 

-I never played a VN before so I was afraid I wasn't going to be kept engaged in the story, but that's why the drink mixing minigame is there. Serving as an incentive to keep you focused to receive optimal dialogue between Jill and her clients and it works perfectly. I found myself being invested in some of the characters hoping I'd be able to see them again soon, or being riddled with curiosity when a new customer stumbled into the bar and what their story was. I was encapsulated and didn't want to put the game down back then, but I did, I'll talk about that later and with a spoiler warning. 
-VA-11 Hall-A, provides probably one of the most human experiences in a video game that I can think of. Working in a service style job and listening to the everyday problems of , for the most part, regular people. They're so well established as people with their own lives that sometimes you don't get conclusions to some of their stories. As it currently stands, some of them are still working their jobs and have their ongoing problems. It's really bittersweet. I may never know how their story concludes, but I'm happy they came across Valhalla however they did, and felt comfortable enough to share their stories with me.

[b]Warning spoilers ahead for one of the major themes of the story[/b]
[spoiler]I want to preface this with a personal story, I stopped talking with my mother a couple of years before this game. I don't really remember the reason, but she wasn't evil and didn't do anything that made me distrust her. I was just incredibly frustrated and hurt one day, and I left her to live with my dad. Years passed and I started wondering I left so abruptly and without word, and I started to feel bad about it. However, I couldn't bring myself to talk to her. I felt so much fear, anxiety, anger(?) with the idea of finally confronting her and talking about it.[/spoiler]
[spoiler]Those that have played the game probably know why I'd bother bringing this up. Jill's relationship with Lenore and Gaby and how that ended, before resurfacing years later forcing Jill to confront Gaby and talk about what happened, reminded me of my situation with my mother. I cried for a while before saving my progress and quitting the game. I didn't resume my playthrough for a while after that.[/spoiler]

-Years later after an emotional break, that I eventually solved, I came back to finish the game I was so invested with from the beginning. It only felt fair to give the game a fair completion for what it had provided me. With a fresh start with the intention to get the good ending, I set off to experience the world again. Remembering all the ups and downs as I had experienced them initially.  Finally finishing the base game recently, I'm finally comfortable enough to try and put my feelings into positive words for the game.
-My words may be jumbled and excessive, but I don't know how else to express how much I love what this game offers and what it means to me."

-Serving drinks can get repetitive

In my honest opinion, the game is best enjoyed playing while midnight with your favorite drink, snacks. It's a very relaxing and a unique game, experience."
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,Now I can be a Bartender like Jill!
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,yep
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"[i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] was a surprisingly potent and intelligent game, even if it did have some misses here and there.

Going into this title, I did not have any sort of expectations as to how the game would go. Seeing as it was a bartending game, I wasn't positive if it would be a very involved or overly simplistic approach to said genre of food preparation releases. Well, the gameplay is a bit strange at first and you might need to practice with the system for a few minutes, but after you get a basic grasp of it, the game is rather simple. Sure, there are some orders you must know to serve with intuition and deduction skills, but besides this, it would be hard to fail a day or somehow manage not to pay your rent on time, which is the main objective of the game. There are items you can buy to increase your performance later on during your shift, websites you can visit to squeeze out more lore from the game, and even a mini-game you can attempt to complete on the side after purchasing the game console in the aforementioned store. Luckily, the main focus is not on the gameplay, but rather, the characters and the narrative they are all intertwined in in some way or another, as the gameplay, in all honest, would not be strong enough to carry an entire game. 

[i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] is more so about the people that walk into your place of work and tell you about recent news, personal information, and just small talk about whatever they find worthwhile. You can build relationships with them through getting their orders correct, and in some cases, deciding what is best for them under certain circumstances, which can unlock their respective endings if you guess correctly. What I did not really expect from this game that I got was a sense of maturity when handling certain subject matters, such as dealing with grief and moving forward in life. What I did sort of expect, however, were unrealistic fantastical elements that are reminiscent of other anime-inspired pieces. When I say fantastical, it is not to say that it is enchanting, but rather unrealistic. Obviously, this game is not meant to be realistic in the slightest when it comes to the premise, but there are good and bad qualities pertaining to being unrealistic one must compare to understand what I mean. Cat woman cyborg hybrids and talking dogs with Hawaiian shirts and sunglasses can be charming and creative additions to a game, but when you attempt to create a game or really any media that is both funny and serious, there had to be a good balancing act taking place. Most of the time, the game does a great job, but sometimes, it misses and I was left with either a bad taste in my mouth or just bored and uninvolved.

During the game, there will be very eventful days and some throwaway ones. Since the game is focused on the rather mundane goal of being able to afford a porn subscription (yes, that is the first primary objective) and ultimately pay your rent, the ending feels rather anticlimactic as a result. Even though there is a main plot point that takes hold around the halfway point which gives the player a look further into the protagonist's  past and present personal life and this leads the rest of the story to this specific concluding point, the point still stands that this piece can lack direction at times. Now, if you have seen any type of story in which this type of character development takes place (meaning the one [i]Jill[/i], the protagonist, faces), you won't really get that much more out of the way this story goes through the same motions, especially because it doesn't try to do anything but the bare minimum to get across its message. Some other characters fell flat for me as well, such as [i]Dana[/i], the boss, and [i]Gillian[/i], your co-bartender, leaving two core characters I was supposed to be acquainted with not fulfilling their purpose, which is rather disappointing in its own right.

Besides these two main gripes, though, I really did have a good time with this game. It surprised me in some ways that I didn't really expect and made up for its flaws in other ways, such as the brilliant art design, sound direction, and character interaction. A lot can be forgiven since it is not supposed to be some brilliant or profound work, which is why I only really fault it for what it lacks as far as the [i]Slice of Life[/i] and [i]Visual Novel[/i] genres go because that is what it is at its core. [i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] is a quaint and heartfelt hybrid that is worthwhile to play through, even if it may not seem life your type of game, as it is more mature than many of its contemporaries and makes an attempt at being human even when dealing with a cybernetic and perhaps even dystopian future.

VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,Very cool cyberpunk bar and characters
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"Odd that the first thing I've been doing lately after getting off work is playing a sim... About work. Lovely characters, I don't think there's any I dislike."
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"A heartfelt story, memorable characters and great soundtrack. Highly recommended."
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,Please just play it for the love of god.
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"If you told me that I'd be discussing the merits of having a child body with a robot prostitute and the edge it gives you in that line of work, I would have called you crazy. And yet that is only one of the many interesting conversations you have in this game. 
 
I picked this game up on a whim, not knowing anything about it, just that the cover art intrigued me. I'm very happy to say this is one of my favorite visual novel style games, hell, it might be one of my favorite games period. 

You play as Jill, a non-nonsense bartender who tends bar at a rundown and shoddy bar which seems to have a penchant for attracting all kinds of odd customers. At first the thought of having to make ""drinks"" for these random characters seemed stupid. But as each character comes in, night after night, and you remember their orders and various conversations you've had, you realize that this is a very well written story. 

Every character feels like someone who could actually be real. From the obnoxious and domineering Mr Donovan (who could very well have been my first boss in real life), to the crazy hyper Streamer-Chan (who is basically a walking LSF poster child), to all the other not-so-random characters who start to frequent your bar, they all feel alive. 

One of my favorite mechanics in the game is that each night at the start and midpoint of your shift, you get to reset the jukebox with 12 of your choice songs. Some of these songs you start with, others you collect throughout the game. The music is absolutely amazing and legitimately one of the best OSTs I've listened to in a while. 

The visual styling of this game proves that 3D and fancy ""life-like"" graphics are not needed to make beautiful art. Every character is unique and memorable, from the ""John"" face of your colleague Gillian, to the tomboyish look of Sei, the paramedic Valkyrie who is more interested in the carnage at the scenes she visits, they all look amazing. 

So, yes, buy the game, it's worth it."

DJMAX RESPECT V,Sports,960170,"New players BEWARE!

There are a lot of other negative reviews of this game, and I think they're all very spot on, but I want to touch on something that not many folks here in the reviews are mentioning which is:

This game is incredibly anti-newcomer. Yes, it looks pretty. Yes, it looks assessable... but beware, because if you purchase this game as a person new to rhythm games looking to get better at them, then you're in the wrong place and you better reconsider and look at playing a free alternative(like OSU!Mania). 

This is the biggest thing that bugs me about DJMAX.

It's honestly such a slap in the face when you come to realization that the only way you can even hope to get better at the game is to stagnantly repeat songs in freestyle that you're comfortable with and slowly move up. Yes, you do get better over time, but I have to argue here that this isn't any effective nor efficient training for the time and effort you put in. NO player wants to feel like they're stuck in a game since that would defeat the purpose of a game being a game, and lol guess what, neowiz is doing exactly that for the newcomers

There's absolutely no way to practice this game efficiently. If you find a song that has only a really hard part towards the end of the track then guess what, you're outta luck. You can play freestyle mode and just keep failing until you get it sometime in the uncertain future I guess... If you really want to practice that part then you'd have to go search YT videos and tap along to a video which I find to be completely inconvenient. Air mode is also a 'no fail' mode, BUT you can't really choose a song you want. And online player lobbies are good option as it is a no fail mode, but you kinda need friends, and I have none :(

All the options I listed above are just not convenient or efficient at all. When I say ""practice/train"", I mean that I would like to sit down and hard practice complex patterns on very low BPM(not low note speed) and slowly raise it until I get it embedded into my muscle memory, and it really frustrates me that I'm not able to have the convenience of a training mode that could really facilitate more motivation and time spent playing the game. Even free games like OSU!Mania has the song map editor where you can actually slow down the BPM of a track to practice, I don't see why a paid game cant include this simple feature as well.

It's funny ya know, you would think an online only game like DJMAX would have more than just pretty colors/anime/weeb art to attract casual players like simply including an effective way to practice would be a good start to help bring more revenue, recognition, and a bigger playerbase to this already niche genre...

Maybe they should've thought about this instead of focusing on an useless ranked mode(that no one plays btw) and shoving xigncode3 down our throats...

Outside of this, it's a good game really, but I think the game has like no replay value at all if you aren't very good at rhythm games to begin with.

House Flipper,Casual,613100,i love this game but you need to add more houses to flip
House Flipper,Casual,613100,"Look, I really like this game. Its a mild experience, something to just mindlessly play and easy to pick up and put down. It has a lot of strengths, letting you express a sizable amount of freedom in what you make, it has a lot of options and props for you to choose from when building, and you really can do a lot with what you have. 

It needs a lot of polish though. There have been several dlcs, and a new one on the way. But there are still a lot of bugs in the base game. Sometimes the game just... stops working for me, ill be playing it and then lose the ability to do everything until I close it down and reopen it, sometimes losing a lot of progress, sometimes only a little. There are a lot of attention to detail things that really bother me, like when plastering tiles the serrations in the grout are the wrong way than what you stroke. It seems lazy. When you're planting multiple plants in the garden dlc, after you have dug to the bottom of any of the holes, you automatically put the shovel away and have to take the shovel out if you want to keep digging. This, combined with other mildly infuriating things upsets me, content is nice, but it seems to be quantity over quality and its getting kind of frustrating, especially since there is more on the way. 

I really think this game could benefit a lot from having the same level of care put into the appearance as someone playing it might put into their home."

House Flipper,Casual,613100,"I've been playing this game since just after its release on steam and back then I wouldn't have recommended it. Since then there have been many updates that have added content and improved the game to make it so much more enjoyable. It can feel a little slow and tedious but once you get past that, it's a seriously addictive game.

House Flipper,Casual,613100,"Honestly just a peaceful game to play, super easy to chill with it"

House Flipper,Casual,613100,New main game
House Flipper,Casual,613100,IM ADICTED ITS THE BEST GAME EVER
House Flipper,Casual,613100,"Awesome house flipping zen game! I can only recommend it, especially now since there's steam workshop support. Reminds me when the Sims was initially developed to be an interior designer game without the life simulation aspects. (true story btw) This is exactly that. Just minus the 9 billion paid dlc's, and the feeling of being ripped off. Or, you might want to remember Viscera Cleanup Detail, just minus the crazy bloodbaths to clean up. I don't really have anything negative to say about House Flipper, it's what it claims to be. If you are hesitating whether to get it or not, trust me, it's worth it. But here's a breakdown.

You play the game in a first person viewpoint, and start at a ran-down little office in a nice looking neighborhood. You can work on your office to make it more comfy, remove garbage, put down stuff, etc, or can start taking jobs right away. At first, it's nothing special: just cleaning places up. But soon enough, you start painting the walls, placing radiators, sinks, furniture, etc. You also need equipment on some missions, and once you get them, it unlocks them at your office as well. And this is where the game all really shines. Instead of just placing objects with the click of a button, you manually have to put some of these things together, from placing the screws to mounting them on the wall, to connecting cables. In short, there's some interactivity, and even skills. Eventually, you earn more cash, and you can buy houses for yourself. They are expensive, and usually ran down, but if you manage to get them to shape, you can sell them for a looot of dough. Or, you can keep them and decorate them, or even relocate your office to them. 

The soundtrack is super calm and very nice, hats off to whoever made it. There's also a day and night cycle. Even though there are no timed missions, you can still check out the lights you placed. As you progress and complete more missions on the laptop, or once you made enough cash, you can start getting more harder, and sometimes crazier missions, or houses. I especially love the little hidden details here and there - you might find hidden cash and weapons in a house which was occupied by... questionable people, and with a free dlc, you can even get a flamethrower that you can use to incinerate garbage, but at the cost of leaving a mess. No, I'm not kidding. 

To sum it all up, it's a good game which makes you want to fix up your own home. Really now, 5/5. If these devs would ever make a life sim game with elements from House Flipper, they could easily rival the Sims."
House Flipper,Casual,613100,Great game! fun to play especially if you like to decorate in games. I wish there was a way to toggle collision so I can place things a bit more freely :3 but other than that! the game is great! I believe I own all of the DLC as well!
House Flipper,Casual,613100,generally just a good game to vibe out to

"
House Flipper,Casual,613100,"this game is just, wow. the words i have to describe the game are just endless. i mean this wholeheartedly, this game is worth it. everything in it just captivates me till ive been on it for hours and dont even realize it. from the cleaning of the windows to the painting of the walls, i feel 100% entranced in this game. the graphics are phenomenal and the various situations and jobs you are tasked to do with are so unique and well thought out. this game will exceed all your expectations i guarantee you. not only that but theyre also constantly adding new things and changing the game so you never finish it completely. i give all my kudos to the game developers because they really outdid themselves with this one. i am absolutely in love with this game and would do anything for it. ive recommended it to friends and theyve also had an extremely positive reaction to it. if youre on the fence about this game heres your sign, get it. its so worth it if you enjoy cleaning and decoration or if you just want something to do to pass your time because i will tell you from firsthand experience that it will fulfill your needs in both categories."
House Flipper,Casual,613100,this game is so cool
House Flipper,Casual,613100,"What can i say. I love this game. it's a slight dissapointment that it doesnt involve and acutal flipping houses upside down, but nobodys perfect. I take a lot of screenshots of this game by accident. you could too!"
House Flipper,Casual,613100,"Good game, very fun and it's quite easy to get into, I will say that it can get a little repetitive after a while. However, that is to be expected when playing a house renovation game. All in all I would definitely recommend this to someone who likes calm and relaxing games."

Would've enjoyed it more with friends if it was multiplayer(I would 100% buy a multiplayer DLC if Frozen District makes one), but still hands down great game"
House Flipper,Casual,613100,This messes with my ocd
House Flipper,Casual,613100," Like a lot of reviews, i liked the idea and its pretty cool at the beginning. It gets pretty repetitive though pretty fast.

The one thing thats swaying my vote to a downvote though is the fact that you cant actually ""remodel"" the house. You can paint and add/take away INTERIOR walls but you cant actually make the house larger or smaller. Despite having a large plot of land, theres no option to add exterior walls or to expand in any capacity.

I was pumped for this game and working my way through to unlock that potential as it just seemed like where the game was progressing. But once i found out its just the same thing over and over it lost its appeal entirely.

IF you like remodelling houses with some basic furniture, give it a go but with the limit of having to work in the constrains of whatever the game has for houses and not being able to really make it your own I lost the motivation to keep going."
House Flipper,Casual,613100,slapped some cockroaches with a sledgehammer
House Flipper,Casual,613100,Multiplayer when?
House Flipper,Casual,613100,Paint it black or take it back.
House Flipper,Casual,613100,"Great way to kill time, honestly. If you wanna play a game and have a show going on the other monitor, this is the game for you. It can get a bit tedious sometimes, but that's the kind of game I like.

Pros:
- lots of items to choose from
- many things to do
- it's a house flipping game what more could you want

Cons:
- cockroaches are finicky when vacuuming them up"
House Flipper,Casual,613100,"i like it no cap
"
House Flipper,Casual,613100,"Pros: I'm spinning like a ballerina with my sledgehammer, I'm almost completely leveled, and every house becomes a new challenge to sell to a specific client. If there is a will, there is a way. Every client gets what they want, even if it is the most disgusting home I 'cleaned up' the barest minimum. 
Honestly I love the freedom of it. It reminds me of the house renovation part of the Sims, but in first-person. 
You have a large selection of houses to fix-up, including one on the MOON! 
The furniture is varied in size and style, and you get to play with colors. 
Cons: Sometimes your debris are the things spinning like a ballerina in the air. Sometimes there is grass in your doorways. Sometimes your whole patio goes transparent. 
HOWEVER, these are MINOR things! 
Devs are good at updating, patching, and giving new content. 
Great game, good fun, worth my 57 hours at the time of the review. Honestly, a lot of it might be mowing grass, because there's nothing like a fresh clean lawn."
House Flipper,Casual,613100,"I really want to review this game positively, as for the most part it is really enjoyable. However there are a number of glitches and problems that currently make parts of the game unusable, and for now I'm going to have to uninstall it. If I could give it a 'meh' review I would, but as Steam only offers thumbs up or thumbs down, for now it's going to be a thumbs down. Apparently the glitches will be patched in an upcoming update that will hopefully change things but I'm still not sure that this game is worth some of the choices theyve made regarding enormous save files that clog up the SSD."

Super Animal Royale,Massively%20Multiplayer,843380,"Alright so I've seen a lot of my friends finally start playing this game so I might as well write this review.

I've been addicted to this game for a while now and there are only a couple of small issues with the game that aren't game breaking. The game is fun, a lot of fun with friends. It's the only battle royale game I like and I dont feel bad about playing it often.

I've met a ton of friends on this game as well, some insanely close friends and I always look forward to playing it with them. The developers of this game are also so kind and caring and I'm glad to even know a couple.

This is definitely a game worth your time to check out, it's free as well so why not give it a try?"
Super Animal Royale,Massively%20Multiplayer,843380,"Honestly, I love this game.  It's fast, cute, hilarious and fun.  With that said, and I hate that I'm leaving a negative review for this, I feel like I've been lied to by the developers.

The recent update brought 'cross-play' to the game.  To quote the developers, this means 'cross-play matchmaking support for Steam and Xbox players to play together'.  In literally every game that's ever been cross-play (that I can remember at least), that means you and your console peasant friends on different systems can finally play a game together.

But that's not the case here- you will play -against- people from other platforms (with PC having the obvious advantage), but you cannot play -with- people from other platforms.  This was never explained pre-update, nor has it been explained since.  After talking this game up for over a month with my Xbox friends (who I can never game with as I'm a PC master race guy), I discovered that you cannot party up with people on other platforms- you can only (possibly) play against them at random.  Oh, and half of my unlocks that I spent weeks/months on magically disappeared, so that was cool too.

This is confusing at best, misleading at worst, and regardless of where your personal thoughts fall on this scale, ultimately disappointing.  Please devs, if you're reading this or hearing similar feedback, fix this or at least explain it."

Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I love this game. But it's not a city builder. 
It's a tile placing puzzler with rural landscape as its setting. 

Dont get me wrong. I'm hooked. But if you're looking for a city builder this isnt it.

This is carcasonne and Islanders smooshed together, which are also two of my favourite games. 

And while I can and have spent hours playing this little gem, I'd love to see more tile variety eventually, like carcasonne expansions. 

Thank you developers for this great little creation."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Pros: 
- Relaxing atmosphere is perfectly executed
- sound effects are varied and delightful
- music is great
- plenty of strategy and planning involved, despite the simple appearance
- hexagons

Cons:
- I found the learning curve a little frustrating for ~30 minutes because I didn't understand the differences between the 3 kinds of quests. But a little reading outside of the game fixed that for me, and now I find it quite a nice system. So maybe I just didn't pay enough attention to the tutorial. 

This game is great."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,This is the perfect chill game to pass time during boring work meetings!
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,I put tiles together and my brain likes it a lot
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Awesome puzzle game that is very simple by its rules and limitations, but at the same time there is this underlying challenge that requires finesse. Getting high score isn't that easy, took me 5 hours of playing before even getting above 5000 points! (I know this doesnt mean anything to you unless you have played)

Loop is simple: you have limited amount of tiles and you get more by placing perfect pieces and completing quests that come with tiles (and few from the map as they spawn through your game). Controlling the map space from the get go is important, as you want to start zoning different areas from the first moments! Keeping that up is the key, and also do not limit your options by for example colliding big city's space with your farmlands.

Great little game. Definately worth its price."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Dorfromantik is a casual tile-based landscape building puzzler with soothing music and pleasing visuals.  You place hexagonal tiles from a randomized ""deck"" of tiles and try to match up elements (farmland, houses, trees, waterways, and railways) to satisfy size requirements that are associated with random tiles in the deck.  When you meet a requirement, you get more tiles added to your deck, and when the deck is empty the game ends.  The trailer on Steam explains the game perfectly and after watching it you pretty much know what to expect from the game.  By the end of the run, the rules of the game cause a pleasantly complex landscape to emerge, with towns, railways, farms, and rivers with boats.  

This game has a lot in common with the also very excellent casual city-building game ""Islanders"", to the point where I'm almost certain the two games share developers in common - although the publisher of this game on Steam is different.  The music, scoring system, progression, and even the voice narrating the trailer are so similar that I'm convinced it's the same people.  

Despite being simple, learning how to progress in the game can get fairly complex, as you learn more about how the different kinds of tiles fit together and the ""meta"" of the game (best practices for where to put certain types of tiles to prevent blocking yourself later).  Like Islanders, the game is simple but not easy.  Accessible without being shallow. 

This is a solid full-price purchase if you appreciate a chilled-out puzzle experience with consistent and pleasing aesthetics, or if you enjoyed the game ""Islanders"".  If you're looking for more of a management simulation city-builder, the complexity is not there in this game but it's still worth playing for the novel puzzling aspects, clean design, and excellent music and visuals."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Bought it four hours before it got 20% off and it was worth all the money.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"An oddly addictive game that strikes the right chords of building puzzler and casual strategy. It also has nothing to do with Romantic Dwarf's. It's hard to describe this game, it's a solid chill yet challenging game experience for those who enjoy a causal puzzle that can get complex quick. The game plays like a more in depth Islanders, with a bit more challenge as well. One of the strengths of this game is how much time travel you will do when you zone in and it's 3 hours later on a match end. I'm an avid Sim City fan & collector and this hits me in a place I wasn't even entirely sure I had anymore with the general placement and development of your layouts. I am very curious to watch this ""Minimalistic city builder"" genre develop. 

This is one of those casual, chill types of games you throw on before bed or during some downtime and just zone out to. Well worth your time if you're into the gameplay videos or have played Islanders and really vibed with it. I just wish they had dark mode cause holy hell does that background start to burn your eyes after 3 hours. Now to just figure out how to get passed 11k on the scores."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Perfect relaxing/chill puzzle game. Though it's listed to be an early access game, it already feels complete.

PS to devs: Your facebook ads worked! :)"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"TL;DR - Not a bad game, but even for a lightweight city builder, it feels lacking in depth. 

After having fallen into an obsession with the similar lightweight city-builder Islanders, I thought this would be a great companion game. However, DorfRomantic feels inferior to it in most respects. This isn't to say that the game is bad in and of itself, but it feels underwhelming in comparison. As a lightweight, low-stress, affordable, visually appealing game, it's perfectly serviceable. But Islanders does all that and provides interesting gameplay, which DorfRomantic doesn't quite deliver on. Specific pain points are listed below. 
[list]

[*] The terrain features don't really interact in any interesting ways - in fact, most of the goals provided incentivize lumping all the similar features together in big blobs, which gets pretty boring. There's no incentive to place farms near towns, or woods next to rail lines, or any interesting buildings except the Rail Station (a hybrid Water/Rail tile with very lenient placement requirements).

[*] Besides the aforementioned Rail Station, pretty much all the unlocks are cosmetic only. The Windmill is just a reskinned farm tile, boats and trains are just kinda there but don't do anything, and the different biomes don't impact gameplay. This isn't bad in and of itself, but the lack of interesting mechanics means that there's not much incentive to actually push for achievements or challenges.

[*] The hex grid is very limiting in terms of placement. New tiles have to be placed adjacent to existing ones. There's many times where you'll get a tile that doesn't really do anything for your current plans. So instead of throwing a useless tile to the side or putting it in storage, you are forced to slap it down someplace random and just hope it works out and doesn't screw you somewhere down the line. 

[*] Water and Rail tiles have restrictions on where they can be placed and what can connect to them, meaning you start to dread seeing those tiles show up in your stack. There's been times where water or rail has blocked otherwise good plays. Instead of giving an opportunity to adjust your strategy or try something new, you instead feel screwed over when forced to place them. When I start actively disliking 2 out of the game's 5 terrain features, I feel like that's a problem. 

[*] Numerous times I've placed a tile and realized it didn't connect in the way I wanted or there was a better placement/rotation somewhere else, but there's no undo option and I just have to live with my failure or torpedo the town entirely.
[/list]
I understand that this is an Early Access game, and additional content is slated for the game. If content comes down that addresses some of these issues, this game will be great, especially at this price point. But for now, Islanders does more for me than DorfRomantic."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I BARELY recommend.. It lacks a LOT in the point/reward/unlock system to keep me wanting to play over and over again. Even when taking the time to make perfect matches every single time to maximize ""Perfect"" placement, you are at the mercy of the random tile generator to keep the game going without depleting your moves, which isn't very long at all. Skill should keep the game going, not random chance of the tile generator stealing away my dopamine kick and leaving me feeling disappointed in the gameplay mechanics. There is no point in trying to beat a previous score if it doesn't rely at least MOSTLY on skill to get the score!

I like the game.... It has potential to be something really good!.... but right now it's a ""Fun At First"" game that loses it's replay appeal a little too quickly.

Skill based unlockables for score multipliers or other bonuses would be a nice added feature.... Maybe ""Natural Disasters"" that negatively affect your score and multipliers which could also reduce the number of tiles on the screen making it more skill-based to increase the size of your kingdom and gain more points. Your ""Enemy"" could be the elements causing the disaster. Something to outwit skillfully to keep the game going. 

More modes!... a ""Beat the clock"" mode would be cool, Multi player for competition, Creative mode is okay, but meh.... 

I know some of my ideas kill the ""Relaxing"" humdrum type feel that is hyped as a core feature of the gameplay.... But casually placing little tiles until the random tile generator has decided you are entitled to go no further gets super old super fast!

UPDATE.... Never mind... I see the developers are satisfied and consider the game complete... So I had to change my vote from recommend to NOT recommend. This game will most likely remain a ""Fun at first"" novelty that quickly devolves into a ""Why am I doing this"" task.

“We are a small team of 4 Game Design students and have set ourselves a clear goal with Dorfromantik for the year 2021. We are happy with the current core gameplay mechanics and don't want to make any more big changes to it."""
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,10/10 The little boats are animated and move throughout their given terrain. More of this please
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I only played this game once so far, and it was already well worth the $8.

This game is charming, soothing, artful. It feels like playing a board game like Settlers kind of, only you get animated countrysides and soundtrack. And there's no resource management really, but you do have to keep track of branching patterns in the map for forests, rivers, fields etc. It was designed by game dev students in Berlin...indie gem <3"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"It's a cute and colourful game, with lots of potential. It's not a city building game, but more like a tile puzzle placement game. It's very addicting and satisfying (my smol brain likes it when the tiles are matching like I want).
However, some upcoming tiles may be random and can f*ck up your landscape, leading to its end or ruining your ideas.
Besides this, it's worth to play it even at full price, and it's so good when you earn achievements.
Can't wait to see the next updates and improvements of this game soon!"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Awesome game. My only regret is that it doesn't have hill and mountain tiles.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I'm going through a hard time right now medically, and this game provides peace and relaxation better than anything else in my library. It stimulates the brain just enough to not be taxing while still having clear goals."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,I think this will be one of my favorite games to just chill to for quite a while.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I can't get enough of this game! It's cute, relaxing, and more immersive than I thought it could be! I'm not very good at it in terms of strategy and all, but I'm still loving the experience of the game even though I have a hard time beating my high scores."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Neat proof of concept, but there is basically no content.
this should've probably been a browser game.

you get 40 tiles to start with, which you can place adjacent of other tiles.

the mechanics arent really explained in the game, so hf figuring them out yourself.

it looked kinda interesting from the video trailers, but the gameplay is super boring, because its 100% dependent on the RNG of getting good ""missions"" for more tiles"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"https://youtu.be/f0wY5jRTKVk

Its the little things that games do, that can make a game either good or great, and Dorfromantik does the little things, which is why the game is so well liked! As a Casual Relaxing tile based city builder (Think Carcassonne) the game checks alot of boxes. I enjoy making my world one tile at a time, and with alot of the small animations like the trains and boats it feel alive. 

There is a bit of a learning curve to the game, and your first cities might look like a mess but you will get better at it, and your cities and landscape will get bigger and bigger as time goes on. Also there is nothing better then waiting for that one tile that fits perfectly into that spot you have been waiting for to make your landscape complete! 

I have attached some gameplay so you can get an idea if this is the game for you! Happy Tile placing! :)"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"This is the perfect ""relax in the evening"" game that I've been looking for. It doesn't take too much concentration for my over-tired brain, if played casually, but it also isn't mindless clicking. It's beautiful to look at. I love seeing the little trains and boats moving through the landscape. It's a very engaging game and I always want to play just a little bit longer. It runs perfectly on my Linux laptop via Proton."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"It's like Islanders but an even stronger dose of ambien. I streamed it for my wife and she immediately fell asleep. 10/10

Going into a little more detail, like every other review says it's a ""city builder"" plop-down-tiles puzzle game. Get the right adjacencies in the right number for more tiles and points and more dopamine and more tiles and even more points and more dopamine. Very, very chill vibes. Probably not a game to play if you're *not* wanting to be relaxed. If a chill adjacency/type tile puzzle is what you're after, though, this definitely has Islanders beat IMO.

Initially I was wondering why it was called ""Dorfromantik"" after booting it up and now I'm under the impression that's the brand name of the sleep aid the company behind this game is manufacturing."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"This is a beautiful, relaxing, lovely game. The fact that's in early access and it's already this good amazes me."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Amazing, relaxing, satisfying. Love it. I wonder if the developers read the comments, but I would suggest adding more quests and objectives. Maybe some campaign. Also I would love to see living things interacting with the landscapes. For example: people settling in the cities. Maybe a big enough city may have a mayor, which brings some benefits. Bigger lake may house fishes, ducks. The forests may have animals in it. This can be expanded vastly. Maybe these things may allow you to build up on already placed tiles and stuff. I realize this is long term expansion of the game, but Im just throwing wild ideas in case it can provide some inspiration."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,A wholesome puzzle game <3
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Game is easy to learn but hard to master. Relaxing music and play at your own pace. Good for releasing stress after a hard day work.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,place tiles be happy
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I wish steam has a ""Neutral"" option.
Is it a bad game? No, But would I recommend this game? No...

The game itself is chill, nice little game to relax and kill time.
Good music, nice artistic style, simple game play.

But at the same time, it's just a chill game to kill time, it's a little to repetitive for what it is, and there isn't much ""game"" beyond placing down tiles ... 

I don't dislike the game, yet it lack something that makes it engaging...
I guess it's not the type of game for me"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Play this after work. You will not regret it.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"This game is an adorable and fun puzzle game. Not incredibly complex, but it's really enjoyable and I have been playing it while I queue for other online games. It's just very soothing seeing this world come together as you place pieces. I really enjoy watching games that slowly generate a random map, like Dwarf Fortress or Loop Hero and this gives a similar vibe.

My big wish for when this reaches full release is a button to 'finish the map.' Sometimes I run out of pieces before I get a satisfying map shape and I would love to see a button alongside ""Game Over"" that turns off your score but turns of creative mode. I would love to just get a nice finished map that I could screenshot for a computer background or a reference map for an tabletop RPG. Also a feature to hide the UI for screenshots (though that might exist, I haven't found it yet)"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"This game is so wonderfully relaxing. I have managed to sink half my day into it without even realising. 
It is exactly what I was hoping it would be. No pressure, nothing too complicated, just a nice, chill, calming experience to sit and waste some time on. It also doesnt seem to feel repetitive, which I would have expected from watching gameplay previously. 
At the moment there is only the standard game mode, but with an additional mode in the works, I can see potential for many more hours of play. 
Fantastic if you want something to pass the time whilst listening to music or podcasts."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"During messy times, it's nice to have a simple and friendly looking game to simply relax. I've only played it for a few minutes, and it helped me release much stress."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Okay, so. I love boardgames. Yes, the ones you play on the table with your real life friends, touching real life thingies and rolling real life dice. One of the games is carcassonne. But my friends don't really like it that much, also corona. I could spend hours placing tiles and making my own world maps. And this game allows you to do that. Endless (if u are smart) map making without the need of friends! Make a river, make a forest, build a city! Yay"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"A good puzzle game and still very relaxing. I like it so far, even though it is still in early access."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Everyone saying, ""oh this game is so peaceful and relaxing,"" apparently they never get tiles with both rivers and railroad tracks."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Time flies when you're playing this game
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I really like the idea, but the game just did not stick with me. It still is early access and I personally found it pretty lackluster. There might be improvements coming and more progression with unlocks but I guess it's maybe just not for everyone. 

There is a lot of good Puzzle games with more depth that might hook you more. The graphics are nice but not nice enough to not get bored of them quickly."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"It's a very simple puzzle game. It started to get repetitive after an hour, but a good relaxing game to try out. If you're bored and looking for something relaxing to play, it might be worth a buy."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"It puts my screaming four month old to sleep and soothes my frayed nerves. 

It's just an amazing, simple, enjoyable game."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Fun game. Simple to play difficult to master. 
The kinda of game when you've got nothing to do you play a round or two.
I only have one issue with the game:
On any given round only 3 in game achievements can be done per game. 
It would be nice if all achievements were active on a given game, 
and the three shown are the ones you are the closest to achieving. 
Other than that,  I look forward to more updates and tile designs."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Super cozy and casual tile-placement puzzle game. Beating your own high score and unlocking beautiful new terrain tiles and colours is motivating, though with it already being so cute and simple those things are just a plus to me! This is the game I go to when I don't have the mental capacity for hardcore strategy or city-builders."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"A very relaxing game. You don't have to worry about time, just take your time to place your tiles and you create a cute little environment that grows as long as you don't run out of tiles."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,A very nice one-hand game that is great for taking a break with.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,awesome game to relax and waste time in a positive way. very addicting !!!

Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Huh?  It's dark outside already!?

This is for the Catan players like me that just want to build their roads and villages without interference of other players. Really look forward to see how this game grows and how new types of tiles may be implemented in the future :)"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"A challenging puzzle game. This is not a city builder game but nonetheless it looks beautiful.

Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Chillest game you can play and still compete against your friends.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Wow. Just wow... hands down the most relaxing and chill game i've played in a very long time. Don't let the screenshots deceive you as the game may appear to be a simplistic city builder; however, when you pull the veil off you'll find an incredibly deep and strategic experience to behold. Be it, the dulcet tones of soothing synths and pianos notes easing you in or the simple art style highlighting what is an addictive game through and through. Thank you devs. I needed this and appreciate all of your hard work. You deserve the kudos!"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I love you guys, wish I could support the devs more! <3"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,the more you play the more you realize how much strategy is involved in this soothing time killing puzzle game.

It's a tile placing puzzle game and it's awesome. It is an extremely relaxing yet interactive experience with an amazing sound track and art design. The game play itself is repetitive yet addicting. The game also has a learning curve surprisingly. Over time you will learn where you should place certain tiles planning ahead of time, when to cut tiles off for creating new areas. I highly suggest you pick it up, it's cheap, fun, and easy to learn. I hope you all have fun placing fields, forests, towns, railways, and waterways in [i] Dofromantik. [/i]"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,awesome relaxing game
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"[h1]This is the game you've been looking forward to buy to play while you work or study[/h1] 
I know you were looking for such thing, I was, everyone is, and we keep buying and adding to our backlog, yet we don't play, and we don't work or study. You know it's true. 

Well hear me out, this one pushed me to work. 
It's calm, got just enough thinking to not make you sleep but not much to take up your mind off whatever you're focused on.
You get a set of tiles (like cards) and you have to choose where to place them to create a beautiful world. That's it. That's all there is to it. I tried before to work/study with Monster Train, but i ended up leaving work and focusing on my ""run"" as it needed much attention. This one here doesn't have this effect. It's perfect.
The music is relaxing if you decide to have it on.
I can't recommend it enough. Out of the 250+ games i have on steam, 50+ on epic, 12 on uPlay... 	[i]THIS RIGHT HERE[/i] is the only game that is perfect to play to relax while working or studying. Congrats to the devs, you create a masterpiece of simplicity and beauty."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I had no idea what to expect from this game, however once I started playing and listening to the soundtrack it immediately relaxed me. I was in the search of a peaceful game that I could just pick up and play. The game doesn't have any long quest lines so you can play however you see fit. Currently I am playing and trying to create the most beautiful world possible and its a lot of fun. I recommend this game to anyone that is looking to play a game that is relaxing but can challenge them to think at the same time in order to progress further."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"It's fun, casual, and a bit of a challenge."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,A nice wholesome chill out after coming home from work.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Incredible, esecially for its price. More complex than I initially presumed and the soundtrack is simply amazing.

Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"This is another ""just one more"" game. And I love it!"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"The biggest problem with Dorfromantik is the lack of progression, after 2 or so hours you've pretty much seen everything the game has to offer, but that simplicity also works in the game's favour. It's very easy to spend an hour or so slowly building up your little piece of countryside, erecting vast forests and idyllic river-side towns, with a giant railway network that goes nowhere and serves no purpose off to the side. The game has a very natural way of encouraging you to make things look at pretty as possible, and even if it deals you a 10 card set of 3-way railway tracks in a row, the visual style still manages to make it look sufficiently pleasant regardless. If anything, the restrictive nature of the game's building system encourages you to be as creative as possible with your approach, which often leads to stuff that's even prettier than what my ape brain could have come up with."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Satisfying *-*
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"This has to be one of my favorite games for now. This game helps me to release my stress after uni work.

Also, special message for devs, Hi devs, is there any way we can have an undo button? I mean, come on, who puts rail in the middle of the town? :("
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"The game is quite fun and interesting.

Features I'd like to see in the game SOON:

- Bonus tiles that boost similar tile chance RNG.
- Controller support
- 2.0 system where buildings will be upgraded if perfect placement STACKING

Hope this gives you and the - Defs -  perspective on the game."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Fun little puzzle game! Super relaxing and pretty with just the right amount of challenge to be engaging. Definitely recommend it!
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Engaging, addicting, and pretty to look at. No controller support, but it isn't hard to whip up a config in Steam for it."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"It's relaxing. Almost as relaxing as minesweeper.
I was hoping more of a tycoon type of game with quests added, so that things don't get too boring.
But it's single player, and the game is extremely repetitive with very few variety.
I played few rounds, all getting around 8500 points-ish score.
But... I don't think I'll play again. Simply because it wasn't fun by the time I finished third round.
I can't recommend this as a game. 
But I would recommend it as a program to just mindlessly spend time."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"This game is a nicely lit candle, a blanket, and a rainy day wrapped in one. It's everything meditation should be, and it will become a part of my daily routine as it gives me a good incentive to slow down, focus on the basics, and breathe."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"This has been my go-to game to relax and concentrate. Reminds me of Carcassonne but far more relaxing.

The gist of the game is basically place tiles adjacent to eachother to complete tilesets, get your points rinse repeat, all the while creating a lovely landscape in the process. 

Unlock special tiles as you continue to play and drop those beauties down as you go. Keep an eye out for white highlighted tiles for extra goodness.

Def recommend this gem."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"tl;dr: Want a chill low-stakes tile-laying game? This is a great one. Want to play score attack? Be prepared to pull your hair out.

Like a lot of other negative reviews, this isn't THAT negative. Dorfromantik is a relaxing tile-laying game in the vein of boardgames like Carcassonne, where you create a landscape one tile at a time, gaining more points for matching the edges of tiles appropriately, and gaining more tiles into your draw pile by completing 'quests' that are all some variation of 'have a terrain feature that is at least/exactly X tiles long / contains at least/exactly X many terrain elements'. The first few playthroughs were quite nice, building a nice little rural region, maybe focusing on quests now and then but not worrying too much. If you think 'oh, that sounds nice,' then stop reading and pick up the game. It's cheap - you'll have a lovely time with it. If you're like me and have more of a competitive, optimization streak, read on.

The game comes with a scoring system - 10 points for every matching edge placed, with a 100-point bonus (and a free extra tile) for completing a 'perfect' tile surrounded on all sides with matching edges. Playing the game to try to maximize score - which overwhelmingly requires generating perfect tiles for the points - is [i]exhausting[/i]. After about ten-fifteen minutes of play, each tile placement becomes a nightmare as you comb the map for the exact right place to lay each and every tile. And if you screw up and accidentially place a tile where you shouldn't (surprisingly easy), there's no undo option, ruining potentially several perfect tiles and hundreds of points. And this isn't even to mention rivers and railroads, which must be connected logically, making it nearly impossible to integrate either map element with your perfect placements. And getting perfect placements at the start is really difficult as well, since you simply lack the correct locations for most kinds of tiles, leading to chains of restarts until you get the sequence of 4-5 tiles in a row that actually let you chain them together.

Overall? It's fine! I enjoyed my first few hours with it, but mostly didn't enjoy my last few. If you're the kind of person looking for a chill tile-placement game to zone out to, you could do a lot worse (maybe check out Islanders too, which I hear is also good, although I haven't played it myself). If you've got the same brainworms I do and can't help but optimizing... maybe pass on it."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Beautiful minimalist puzzle game in your downtime. I needed a new in-between-meetings game and this one fit perfectly.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Relaxing. Meditative. Addictive in a calming way. The game can be played for beauty or strategy, and has the effect of making all other stresses disappear."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Great little game. Beautiful music and charming graphics. Very chill and really nice when you want to play something light and not too intense. Quite a bit to do surprisingly. 9/10
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"This is a pretty relaxing game, hours of chill fun (I had no idea I'd already played so many hours of this game). It's easy to play, challenging when you're ready to be challenged, but never tense. Just peaceful. The best part is settling into the ""flow state"", getting in The Zone, and just laying down tiles and building endlessly. The worst part is running out of tiles and having to stop. I hope there will be additional features to make it easier to keep going and going.

Some possible examples:
1. A game mode where you just don't run out of tiles (but maybe then you can't unlock any new secret tiles - or the game mode is unlocked after you have unlocked all the secret tiles). Maybe this is what the proposed ""Creative Mode"" will be?
2. UNDO. A single undo, or even destroy a tile would be great for those mis-click moments where you put something down where you didn't want to.
3. The ability to set aside one or more tiles to use later (or draw multiple tiles like a ""hand"" and choose which order to lay them down), because sometimes you get a piece you don't need NOW but will need SOON.
4. Or, the ability to trash or reshuffle the current tile.
5. The ability to mulligan/reshuffle the entire stack, when just nothing is looking good.
6. The ability to buy a specific tile you need - maybe chosen from a few specific ones rather than selecting ALL possible tiles (like, a station, a full water tile, a full forest, full field, and so on).

Features like that would be nice amenities, but aren't necessities. To be clear, I'm having plenty of fun with the game exactly as it is! After all, my suggestions are all ways to continue playing the game, specifically to prolong the flow state.

Even if it stays as it is, it's a work of art! Absolutely worth it. Thumbs up!"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Great Game, 
Tetris like gravitational head, super relaxing Soundtrack

to Devs: can you check the hook in Unity to make it VR compatible, done very Quick so we can play it with HMD in 3D(Still Mouse controlled of course)"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Very relaxing game. It's not too hard to play and you can enjoy the beautiful town that you build it your own. Highly recommended.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,A seductive and tasty game
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Cute graphics and as others have said very relaxing. I'm looking forward to the Creative Mode that is coming soon.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"In my mind, this is the ultimate puzzle of game theory: an inch wide and a mile deep. Simple mechanics, place a single tile at a time to fill the board. As you go, the strategy of each tile may be weighed upon exponentially increasing options, weighing the benefits of [completing  board requirements] versus the [constrictions, the corners you play yourself in to]. 

Addicting if you're autistic tbh."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,pog game that is really relaxing
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Relaxing
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,A game never made me cry myself to sleep so comforting. 10/10
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I don't know. I want to like this game, but I can't like it very much. It's Entanglement, Tiny Town, and maybe Frost, mixed up into mush and then sort of ruined by something I can't quite put my finger on.

I think my dissatisfaction centers on the absence of any way to set aside tiles I'd rather use later. Combine this with never having a choice between multiple tiles, no option to shuffle them or peek ahead, and so far as I can tell no way to build or even examine your deck between games - it amounts to a nightmare feeling where the more tiles I collect, the less my familiarity with the deck becomes and the greater my chance of being stuck with something I can't use yet but would have liked to use later.

I can't imagine this never being addressed, but then again I can. Watch a few playthroughs and make sure you understand what you're getting yourself into. If you don't imagine it driving you up the wall, go ahead and buy the game anyway because it's cute as a button and might even be fun. And, my comparisons notwithstanding, there isn't really anything else like it."

SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated,Casual,969990,I think all you need to know is that this is the first game I have ever 100% completed. And I had so much fun I kind of want to replay it even though I finished it last night.
SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated,Casual,969990,"Original was better. At least from the perspective of me at 8 years old or whatever I was. 
Shoutout to the devs for their work on this though, looks really nice and all that. Just makes you realize that platformers have come a long way. Sections of the game just seem so slow and boring like it was made for kids. I guess it was though. Wild."

SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated,Casual,969990,"I'm saying yes, I'd recommend this game, but there are a lot of flaws that I'd like to talk about as well. If i could give a ""Maybe"" recommendation, I would honestly do just that. But let me go through all the pros and cons.

Pros:
-Visually, the game looks great. It's bright and colorful and looks very modernized compared to the original.
-Gameplay is pretty smooth overall, platforming mechanics and combat are textbook for a 3D platformer.
-Remastered soundtracks. Yes, YES, YESSS!!!
-Glitches that are good for speedrunning.

Cons:
-Main boss fights are awful. Two of the four were ruined in almost all ways (Robo-Pat and Robo-Spongebob's Brain along with Robo-Plankton), one was slightly improved (Robo-Sandy), and one was basically unchanged. (Robo-Spongebob)
-Glitches that are bad... in general.
-Overhyped. Nostalgia trip just wasn't there. As I was playing I just wanted to go back and play the original. (which is exactly what I did).
-The game is more aimed towards kids. When I say this, I'm mostly referring to gameplay, level design, and boss fights. Everything is ten times easier than the original, which had some segments and a specific boss, Robot Patrick, that actually had quite a bit of difficulty behind them. This was basically thrown away entirely, and while this was an understandable decision, it's just more of a reason for people like me, who wanted to re-experience what I played when I was five, to steer away from this game and play the original again. That's why I'm considering this more of a con than a pro.

So... yeah. The game is good for kids, definitely. If you buy this game for your eight year old son, he'll get those classic jokes from when I used to watch Spongebob as a kid (which are much better than today's Spongebob Episodes), you'll probably find them glued to the damn screen. But for people like me, it just didn't hit me the way I wanted it to. I wouldn't necessarily say it was bad in any way, but it just didn't satisfy my hunger for the nostalgic feeling I was looking for, and I feel many would agree with me also.

6/10, Above Average. The multiplayer isn't even worth talking about, so I aint gonna."

SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated,Casual,969990,"I grew up playing the original. Love the new Coat of paint
Overall a really fun Collectathon."
SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated,Casual,969990,"A very charming game. Had a lot of fun collecting the achievements. Found some minor bugs where I got stuck but that was mostly my fault with me trying to get out of the map or skip area's that your not suppose to. I really hope they ""rehydrate"" more of the spongebob games in the future such as Atlantis Squarepantis, The Yellow Avenger, and Creature from the Krusty Krab. (My favorites). The game was really easy, although very slow. I found my self wishing so many times I could sprint in the game but I know they couldn't implement that feature without ruining the platforming of the game. And I know nickelodeon wouldn't allow modding in their games, But If they did I and everyone else could get so much more enjoyment out of this game. A hat in time is a good example. Mr krab replacement voice is ok, I wish he could sound a little bit older though, But mermaid-man was OFFLE. He spoke so slowly and didn't even sound over the age of 25. I haven't played any of the co-op mini games, But I would have really liked it if they added a co-op multiplayer mode for the campaign. Ik it would have been a lot more work, but It would be great being able to play this together with a friend. All in all its a really great game. Something both old and new players can enjoy, Very nostalgic and humorous. I hope they make more like this."
SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated,Casual,969990,I wish Clancy Brown was in this
SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated,Casual,969990,"This is one of the games that truly deserved a remaster and I can't tell you how many times I replayed the original version throughout my childhood, it was a lot and even now I consider it such a great childhood game- most importantly, one that stayed great into adulthood and is for all ages despite being Spongebob.
The difficulty of this game when I was younger was quite challenging at times, for a kid, obviously, and even now retains *some* of that difficulty for adults, even though yes I consider it an easy game, there are still parts of this that got me a little irritated- which is heavily encouraged by the way. No one likes a game that is too easy.
I knew of the release of the Rehydrated when it came out but put it off for a year because I ""didn't want to replay a Spongebob game"", for the most part, and while yeah, maybe some people won't want to replay it for Spongebob purposes, it is an extremely fun, beautiful, and incredible platformer game, one I put on practically the same level as A Hat In Time which I consider the best one out there!

First thing I noticed when playing this game was how truly great everything looked, which actually wasn't my original thought before playing it. I had actually almost criticised it before I played it, such as the screenshots of the game showed that it was honestly *too* bright. While some parts of this game are actually really bright, it is easy to overlook once you are in the game and I never found it to irritate me. It really does look 100x better while you're playing it, nonetheless you can always turn your brightness down so it is far from a complaint- the game is EXTREMELY well recreated and you can tell a LOT of effort went into this remaster, keeping it incredibly true to the original, changing nothing and improving absolutely everything. I even noticed some things I didn't in the original due to lack of detail or just overall graphic flaws in the old version.

I'm a completionist despite having no ""perfect games"" on Steam until now(believe me, I've tried and even practically gotten there twice on consoles), so a game that has an abundance (200+) achievements, and some being extremely and almost downright impossible to get, have a large tendency to turn me away from a game unless it's so good to the point I can overlook achievements. Even then I'm pretty content with having all achievements except 2 or 3 in games because it's close enough. The achievements in this game are quite literally perfect, although I woulds say there are no ""hard"" achievements, but that's also because this game is extremely do-able in terms of 100% completion which I aimed for the second I played this game, which I managed after 13.7 hours.
I can't remember if it was in the original, but the fact you can track how many collectables you have in each ""area"", or should I say level, is perfect and spared me of insanity checking every level for everything I missed.

Overall this is a perfect remaster and I'm not sure what more to say besides that, it's definitely worth playing and my only complaint is the settings should have a lot more options than it does. The walk speed is somewhat on the slower side, not an issue but if I wanted to go back and forth it was a little bit slow and entered my mind as annoying sometimes since I just wanted to do something fast. Again, not a complaint, just a little irritating at times which the average player won't care about. It has quite a lot of playtime at I'm going to assume 15 hours depending on how good and fast you are and if you want 100% completion. Something I want to touch on in terms of completing the game, I spent my last 40,000 shiny objects on the practically useless Theatre which just lets you view probably 10 pieces of concept art you can find on Google, instead of Mr. Krabs for the last few Spatulas; had to look up a Youtube tutorial and spend an hour of my time grinding for shiny objects to get the last ones from him since I was left broke. (You need around 40,000 for him.) I'm not sure if unlocking the Theatre counts towards 100%, but to be safe I'd recommend leaving unlocking that until the very end of the game, or else you're stuck to be left grinding like I was for the last part."

I actually wrote the top half of this review before completing all the chapters... and lemme tell you... I didn't expect to be this emotionally affected by the end of it. What a brilliant story, and I'm not gonna lie, even the annoying parts had me laughing out loud because they were so cleverly meta."
There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension,Casual,1240210,I enjoyed the game. The puzzles are good and not too hard. The story and comedy were solid.
There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension,Casual,1240210,"In [i]There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension[/i], you play as a User who is attempting to play a video game only to be dissuaded by the narrator, known only as The Game, who says that there is in fact no game and the User should just do something else. The User attempts to do an end-run around The Game which only unleashes a glitch in the programming and sets the duo off on a bizarre, meta, and comedic adventure through gaming.

This game is an expansion of the short and similarly titled [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1241700/There_Is_No_Game_Jam_Edition_2015/]There Is No Game[/url][/i] (2015). It is mainly a comedy type game parodying video gaming while also containing several puzzles to solve.

To start with one of the best aspects of this game, the art used is excellent throughout. The style throughout most of the game is stylized pixel art. I found that the art was beautifully done in all respects not just for the main scenes of the game, but it also nails different styles of art from the games it parodies from the 1990s. The game's creators really did a great job of mostly sticking to pixel art, but using it in a variety of creative ways to create different types of scenes.

The sound design works quite well in multiple respects, too. The music in the game is a joy to listen to. As with the artwork, there are many types of musical tracks depending on the section of the game from a heartfelt song about love and loss to a hilarious rap track. The sound in the game is bolstered by the excellent narration work done by Pascal Cammisotto playing The Game and a few other characters as well (and who also was a writer).

The real meat of this game would be the writing and story. As mentioned above, this is mainly a comedy and parody game. I will try to avoid spoilers here as it is best to go into the game knowing little for the fullest enjoyment. I will say that the writing and experience of the game is quite enjoyable. At its core, the game is essentially a parody of video games much in the same vein as [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/221910/The_Stanley_Parable]The Stanley Parable[/url][/i] (2013). Indeed, it seems that [i]There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension[/i] took much inspiration from [i]The Stanley Parable[/i] from the over-the-top narrator frustrating or being frustrated by the human player to the meta humor and commentary on video gaming as a medium. Suffice it to say that if you liked the type of humor and writing in a game like [i]The Stanley Parable[/i], you will enjoy [i]There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension[/i].

In addition to the meta-humor, the game nails its parodies of video games themselves taking a good amount of inspiration from games of the 1990s. These parodies include a sequence based on LucasArts adventure games such as [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/388210/Day_of_the_Tentacle_Remastered/]Day of the Tentacle[/url][/i] (1993) and some of the earlier titles of [i]The Legend of Zelda[/i] series. The game does a good job of evoking the styles, including art and sound, of these games.

While mostly a comedic game, this also contains many puzzles to solve to progress the story. I found that the puzzles were enjoyable and not so difficult as to be aggravating. The game does have a built-in hint system if you truly get stuck while the narration will offer a few subtle clues to push you in the right direction. Some of the puzzles were definitely on the easier side, though, so if you really want to play this specifically for the puzzles, you may be disappointed.

Overall, I really enjoyed what this game had to offer with its bizarre and meta sense of humor, stunning graphics, and enjoyable music. I only scratched the surface with the type of writing to expect in this game as there is much to discover. I would recommend this game to those looking for something comedic with some puzzle solving along the way."
ATRI -My Dear Moments-,Casual,1230140,"[h1]Story[/h1]
In the distant future, an unexplained event has left the world facing a rise in sea elevation which has left a large portion of the population underwater. In a town that is being slowly enveloped by the rising water, we have [b]Natsuki[/b], the main protagonist who is seeking to find money so that he can buy a cybernetic leg to replace his aging prosthetic that has begun to wear out.

[b]Natsuki[/b] knowing about a secret treasure that his grandmother has kept for years heads down into the water towards her now submerged house in search of this mysterious treasure. The treasure that he ends up finding turns out to be a humanoid android who goes by the name of [b]Atri[/b].

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]An amazing story with great characters that are well crafted
[*]Multiple choices that lead to different endings
[*]Beautiful anime art style brimming with life in a post-apocalyptic setting
[*]Fantastic soundtrack that is pleasing to the ears with its piano tunes
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]The pacing at times can be slow
[*]There are only three segments where your choices matter
[*]I would have liked to see more world-building
[/list]

[h1]What I liked from the story[/h1]
The story is presented very well and I loved the setting that was shown. An unexplained sea rise has left most of the population underwater with the remaining people left holding onto nothing more but a slither of hope. 

[b]Natsuki[/b] lives in a small town that doesn't even have power with the exception of a few areas. I liked how the VN showed us how generators work when used with water to make electricity.  They use this electricity to power only a few lights, yet the townspeople are overjoyed by this miracle of light further emphasizing the type of reality that they are in.

The story can get emotional with a few of the themes that it tackles and you may find yourself deeply caring for an android after seeing her perspectives about the world around her. You may never want that feeling to go away as it feels life-changing. Sometimes a new perspective can be very enlightening, and for me, this was very refreshing to get from a visual novel.

At certain points, you can choose between dialogue options which will determine the ending that you will get. There are three endings you can obtain in total, a good, bad, and true ending. In order to unlock the true ending, you will have to complete the good and bad endings first.

[h1]Problems with the story[/h1]
I did have some issues with the pacing as it felt slow where the story just seemed to drag on. This mainly appeared in the middle of the story and I felt that some of the things mentioned were unnecessary and could have easily been left out.

The one thing that helps to make it redeemable is that the characters are very likeable preventing it from being a total drag. I also would have liked to see more dialogue options as we are limited to only three for the entire story. I think having more options would have made the slower parts more interesting and would help make the characters feel more alive.

World-building is another area that I would have liked to see more of as what they do have is quite interesting. I wanted to know how other countries reacted to the world being flooded and how they survived up to this point.

[h1]Characters[/h1]
We are in the shoes of [b]Natsuki[/b] and he just wants to live a normal life. He is a high school dropout, who was forced out as he could no longer afford his tuition fees. He thought he had nobody to turn to for help until he met [b]Atri[/b], who changed his life for the better, helping him find meaning in his life. He will help others when the time comes and can be quite caring for other people. [b]Natsuki[/b] is currently motivated to find money as he has a prosthetic leg that is in need of a replacement.

[b]Atri[/b] is a cute android that will help [b]Natsuki[/b] with some of his daily needs. She also wants to learn about the world around her and discover new things about herself and people. It’s like watching someone grow up as a child, where they see the whole world differently than adults do. She will show emotions in certain situations, react to certain people, and may end up defending [b]Narsuki[/b] from trouble. She helps him cook and generally takes care of him saying that she is [b]Natsuki’s[/b] new leg since he has difficulty doing certain things and is not the best at taking care of himself.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2509885084
[b]Ryuuiji[/b] is a character that surprised me by how well done he is as a character who develops throughout the story. I loved his personality as he is chill when you get to know him and he also helps [b]Natsuki[/b]. At first, he came off as a character who did not want to be bothered with but redeemed himself throughout the story. [b]Ryuuji[/b] turned out to be my favorite character, plus he knows guitar so that’s an added bonus.

[h1]Graphics, soundtrack, and performance[/h1]
The art style is really beautiful. I loved the amount of detail that was put into it and how well-drawn both the characters and environments are. It was made by the same developers who worked on If My Heart Had Wings which had some of the best graphics that I have seen in a visual novel. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2497271742
The soundtrack is another thing I found great and well-executed. The piano tunes are very soothing to listen to and never distract from the scene. Everything runs smoothly and I experienced no issues with it. I played on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, with16 GB of RAM.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
If you are looking for a good emotional story, then [b]Atri: My Dear Moments[/b] is highly recommended. It will take you on an interesting rollercoaster in a world that is barely hanging onto a sliver of hope. The characters take the front stage and are really what makes this visual novel so interesting and is perfect for anyone who likes slice-of-life kind of stories.

ATRI -My Dear Moments-,Casual,1230140,"This was the most bittersweet story I've ever read. No, I'm serious. I usually avoid those, because I'm fairly weak to them emotionally, but I just had to see this one for myself because of all the positive reviews and the high vndb score. I wasn't disappointed one bit.

It has one of the best character developments I've seen, like, ever, both the main character, Natsuki and Atri are fantastic. Atri is also just the cutest thing ever, but fortunately, she has a lot more going for her than just cuteness. But you have to see that for yourself. Even the supporting cast is great, I have zero complaints. It deals with some interesting topics, such as, what it means to have a soul, and exploring human emotions. I'm not going to dive any deeper, you really have to experience this (in my opinion) masterpiece for yourself. If you can't handle bittersweet stories, like myself, it might be difficult to bring yourself to read it, but honestly, I'm not regretting shedding literal tears over it. By that, I obviously mean the several absolutely beautiful scenes, bursting with emotions."

Wobbly Life,Casual,1211020,"I really enjoy this game very much. It's one of the games which are suitable for kids and adults.
There's a lot of stuff to explore and you can easily spend your time fooling around with friends or do jobs together like delivering pizza and stuff to collect money and buy clothes, pets, houses or cars and stuff.
Would be cool if there would be an option to disable the timelimit when doing jobs, so younger kids could enjoy them too.
There are also cool achievements and great puzzles to be solved. So many secrets to explore... ! Thumbs up!

Aokana - Four Rhythms Across the Blue,Casual,1044620,"[h1]Aokana - Four Rhythms Across the Blue
蒼の彼方のフォーリズム[/h1]

[b]Disclaimer[/b]: Everything is based on my opinion. I am not a hardcore VN reader, but I have read around ~20 VN titles. This review contains some minor spoiler hidden behind spoiler tags.
Also, did some translation criticisms. [i]TL;DR at bottom[/i].

Story length: 20-40 hours for all routes (Still depends on how fast you read, but this is a good estimate)

I'll start with the most important statement of the experience: [b][u]Aokana is good.[/u][/b]
It is one of the most well-received VNs for a lot of reasons. It has a fun engaging story.
School life, sci-fi, sports, all at once! You also don't see much sports-centric VN around.
It's a great VN overall. 


[h1]Characters[/h1]

Generally, the characters are interesting and unique; while some can be associated with a certain trope. Some characters are well-developed with reasonable backgrounds.

I personally think the MC, Masaya Hinata, has a weak back story. [spoiler]He basically exhibited PTSD at a young age after getting outsped by a newbie,[/spoiler] though still enough to keep the plot going.
3 of 4 main heroine got their own interesting back story as well. The other heroine didn't have any compelling background.

At a point, it seemed to focus too much on [spoiler]Asuka[/spoiler] for quite some time. It felt like she always had the preferential treatment, but it was not the case.
The common route eventually focused on specific characters and switched it around.

Every side character had at least minor role to fulfill in certain routes. Though 1 or 2 minor characters are almost at the point of being irrelevant; and the story won't change even if they were to be removed.

The main antagonist/nemesis has a weak motivation factor. [spoiler]The VN didn't explain why Saki Inui is so attached to Irina Avalon; and why Irina hates to have fun. Being the best at the sport just because you hate to have fun is a weak argument for a villain if you ask me.[/spoiler]

[h1]Art & Sound[/h1]
I want to mention early that the [i]art for this VN is really great[/i]. Most of the characters, especially the heroines, are clearly appealing and charming.
Even the side characters are attractive and expressive. Character sprites has numerous expressions and poses. CGs are wonderfully presented. Backgrounds are pleasant and clean. Color choices are vividly pleasing to the eye.
The skies and clouds deserve a special mention on how good they are drawn despite being easily overlooked. Chibi moments are cute too!

Though it doesn't go without any con. Some shading and shadows doesn't make any sense, especially on [spoiler]Shindou and Kasumi. For Shindou, you'd assume he was a villain because of the color and the dark aura he gives off but he's actually a nice guy. As for Kasumi, she has the darkest shading and shadows that goes with her edgy character design and attitude. After her ""change of heart"", her complexion and shading totally changed.[/spoiler]
Some shadows doesn't make any sense when you're floating in air with direct sunlight on your skin.
For a VN that needs to represent positions in a 3D space, they did poorly in distinct representation of positions. It's hard to interpret the movements without the corresponding text.

Music is overall great and helps set the atmosphere and mood; but nothing worthy of making it into your playlist. Battle music that plays during matches also sets up the hype and intensity. Song tracks are well-timed for climax.
Sound effects are okay, nothing remarkable. The dog just doesn't sound like a dog.
I'd rate the soundtrack pretty high.

[h1]Technical Interface[/h1]

For a modern VN, it lacks some QoL features.
Though not really a big issue, UI has unlabeled buttons, and there are no tooltips when you hover cursor over them. 
There are no key binds for basic features such as auto-play, quick save, load, etc.
There is no colored backplate nor fonts to easily associate who is speaking. It gets confusing at times, especially when you don't want to waste a glance on the name of the speaker. 

Voice bookmark is an unnecessary feature but definitely a welcome one. I have saved 128/150 voice lines, and I can say it's a good thing. [spoiler]I've saved a lot of funny dialogues from Misaki[/spoiler]

This VN has a feature of changing the language after a single key press. Pressing 'J' changes the language to Japanese; 'E' for English; ""C"" for Simplified Chinese; and 'T' for Traditional Chinese. This feature can help those people learning Japanese.

The game also offers 1440P Hi-Resolution assets, which isn't present in most modern VNs as most are still 720P.

The gallery is unlocked after finishing a single route. The gallery system is good with playback of specific scenes, huge number of CGs and videos, and music player.

An existing patch can be applied to the game files to unlock the Perfect Edition of the game which contains explicit content. [u]Link will be in the comments[/u]

[h1]Translation[/h1]
[i]This part of the discussion is limited to the English translation of the original Japanese text[/i]

As for the translation quality, it generally seems okay, but I can't call it good.
There are several typos and some questionable decisions. Some lines are unexpectedly translated to give a different idea than the intended Japanese line; thus, changing the context. They added lines that weren't originally there. At times, it did the opposite and removed lines for no particular reason. It's difficult to properly follow the voice acting when the translation is that inconsistent. I know it's not possible to do that perfectly for every line but it can definitely be done better than this. 

A few of the translation can only be understood with Japanese characters in mind. Most of the wordplay can't be translated to English, so the translator has to find the nearest English equivalent, which itself might give the wrong interpretation. There are a lot of lines where the translation just doesn't do the job of conveying what things were intended to be. Some context are lost in the process of translation. There is a few objectively wrong translation. Also, a lot of inconsistency in the way they translated some kanji to English. You just can't change the meaning of a kanji halfway after you introduced its translation.

Despite being a foreigner, Irina's Japanese isn't that broken nor bad; however, the English translation made it seem like that she's speaking broken Japanese by using broken English. This is not the case. The MC even made a remark on how good her Japanese is.

The translation is still passable. The plot is still told as it should be. Aside from wordplays, idioms, and jokes, I don't think you'll be missing anything else.

[b]Personal thoughts[/b]

• For something that talks a lot about physics, they are ignoring a lot of physics. Though  I know this is sci-fi and they can go with whatever science they want. I just think there are numerous flaws once you start to think about it.
• For the Perfect Edition, there is a single explicit scene that wasn't present in any of the routes. You have to view it in the gallery to play the scene. I'm not sure why this is the case. (Link for Perfect Edition will be in the comments)
• Madoka Aoyagi's voice acting is great. Her VA definitely nailed that ""responsible jester"" character.
• How would you compare the heroines? [spoiler]Misaki > Asuka > Rika > Mashiro[/spoiler]
• Best sprite - [spoiler]Hayato Shirase. He looks so damn cool[/spoiler]
• I didn't encounter any bugs or crash
• Is it worth buying full price? Yes.
• Looking forward on getting Aokana EXTRA 1 and EXTRA 2

[b]TL;DR[/b] Great art and music, good plot. If you're looking for your next VN, get Aokana.
Final rating: [b]8.5/10[/b]"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"Alright, I've waited years to do this, and finally it's time to put forth a review here.

For context, Isaac was one of the two games (the other being Spelunky) that got me to dump AAA games and switch to almost exclusively playing indies (AAA games getting progressively more slimy and worthless also helped though).  That was the ORIGINAL Isaac, and it was seriously just THAT DARNED GOOD.  And then Rebirth came out and upgraded EVERYTHING.  Needless to say, this is by far one of my favorite games of all time.  Top 3, I'd say.  Considering I've been gaming since the days of the 2600... that's extremely high praise.

So yeah.  I like it.  But I'm going to do this review a bit different.  Instead of talking about what the game is like and all of that like I usually do, let's just go over some good/bad points, and maybe a bit about the expansions.

First, the good.  Well, there is a LOT of good here.  The design of basically everything is outright masterful, and there is an absolutely stupid amount of content here.  An absolutely astonishing number of items, enemies, bosses, areas, and so on.  Getting 1000+ hours out of this game isnt exactly unheard of, and it's very easy to see why.

What's more, despite the roguelike nature of it, Isaac is a skill-based game.  RNG cant kill you... unless you let it.  Skill, knowledge, and making good decisions... like any good roguelike, that's what wins runs for you here.  This is a game that gets it RIGHT.  ...Mostly.  With 20 bazillionty enemies/bosses/rooms you do get a dud here and there, occaisional things that rather need an overhaul as they can produce unavoidable attacks.  Fortunately, this is quite rare (and expansions make it more rare).  But still, it DOES happen every now and then.  

Also, the items you find are often just lots of fun to use.  So many creative concepts here.  And the concept of wild synergies just adds to the fun, and makes it so that runs can be so wildly different from one another that even 800+ hours in (I have the game on other platforms) I *still* am surprised by it at times.

Character variety also goes a long way here... there's a darned wide cast of dudes to pick from, and drastically moreso if you buy the expansions.  

The controls are superb, though one small issue is that Isaac's hitbox is... strange.  Even to this day I sometimes find myself not *quite* sure just where it is, particularly as his sprite evolves and warps as you get items.  That's a pretty minor issue though.

And the game can be so darned exciting... when it's being challenging.

One major issue that I've always had with Isaac is that, by default, it is simply far, far too easy.  If you're used to other roguelikes, this one in its base state will be child's play to you.  It has ""balance issues"", and that's putting it VERY mildly.  The game is FAR too easy, allowing the player to become an overpowered disaster almost every run once you know how (and it sure aint hard to figure out how).  While some players like that, I've always found it fantastically boring... I'm sorry, but ""enter room and push win button"" over and over again in 70% of runs isnt very interesting and I find that my interest fades very fast... up until recently, while I love the game, I didnt PLAY it all that often due to the fact that the absolute lack of challenge would cause me to lose interest fast.

Fortunately, that changed with Repentance.  That DLC performs an absolute overhaul of the game's balance, and turns it into more of a PROPER roguelike... darned difficult, and drastically less common that you will get overpowered.  It becomes more in line with other games in this genre, and to me that is a very good thing.  Not to mention that DLC also just adds tons of amazing content.  So, if you want any actual challenge... make sure to pick that up, otherwise you really wont find much of any.  The game is seriously mindless without it.

But, even with that, there are still other issues.  Two particular things stand out to me:  The absolutely atrocious unlock system, and the fact that the game NEVER EXPLAINS ANYTHING.  Wanna know what that item there does?  Well TOO BAD because it will not tell you.  Better learn by trial and error and then MEMORIZE the many 100s of items in here.  Or, better yet, get Afterbirth+ (which adds mod support) and just get the item description mod.  Without that... hoboy, better get used to alt-tabbing.

But then there's the unlock system... I hate it.  I *HATE* it.  Look, I grew up in the days of really primitive games... the 2600 and NES for instance.  I do not, and never will, understand modern gaming's obsession with achievements and unlocks.  But honestly, even for those who DO understand, this is likely to still be a massive source of frustration.  SO MANY FREAKING THINGS are locked behind arbitrary and often irritating nonsense, some of which genuinely does require that the RNG be very kind to you.  Other things are just stupidly annoying, like trying to beat X final boss with The Lost (a challenge character who dies if you look at him too hard).  Or doing ANYTHING with Jacob and Esau (from Repentance) who are fun enough, but who DO NOT work well with unlocks, as the game is not formatted for their bizarre dual hitbox.  An absolutely astonishing amount of things require that you unlock them before using them, and that is... irritating.  It is by far my biggest complaint with the game.

Also, there are expansions!  Great stuff really.  Afterbirth is pretty basic... it is MOAR STUFF, lots of fun things.  Afterbirth+ also adds MOAR STUFF, but is truly about modding the game.  You can customize your experience and play it how YOU want to!  People have come up with some incredibly creative and fun things.  One thing to note: you MUST have Afterbirth+ to use Repentance.

And Repentance itself is, to me, the best of all.  It is Antibirth integrated officially into the game, with way more added on top.  And like I said, it rebalances EVERYTHING.  OP broken things are nerfed, but even moreso, about a bazillion items got buffed.  The game is far harder, and there are alternate levels, even more endings, and ALL of the content is just SO FREAKING GOOD.

One thing I do want to mention though:  particularly with Repentance, this game is at its best when you DONT just stick to ""the meta"" (which is frankly something I say about all roguelikes).  EXPERIMENT with the different items.  Despite what some players may say, I genuinely think there are very, very few ACTUALLY bad items in the game.  Like, less than 10.  There are certainly some situational items out there (and deciding when to take something and when NOT to is a big part of the game!) but that sure doesnt make them bad... learn when they work well, and when they dont.  USE EVERYTHING... even if you've used it before and it seemed bad.  Again, this is seriously advice for the entire genre.  But this DLC *really* ups the need to approach it this way, if you want the best experience and the most fun.

And dont be afraid of losing.  Dont let it bother you when it happens.  Again, good advice for the entire genre, not just this.

There is honestly sooo much more I could say about this game, and almost all of it is positive.  But you know, Steam character limit.

One way or another... it is fantastic.  One of the best.  And the DLC just makes it way better.  It does have a couple of odd issues, sure, but those can be fixed in many cases (with the DLCs) and for those that cant be fixed, well... the rest is just so darned good that those problems get a pass.

Just amazing.  Congratulations to Edmund and his team for creating something so incredible.  And then improving on it even further.

...Seriously get the DLCs though. They are great."

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"Polished enough to be called a sequels worth of improvement upon the original, Rebirth is a remake of Binding of Isaac in a shiny new engine. It runs smoothly at 60 FPS, there are loads of quality of life improvements, new content(especially with the DLC) and design elements like new enemies, room modifiers, soundtrack, graphics and so on. It really is a brand new Isaac with all the numerous pros and a few heavy cons straight from the original. 

BoI is about a naked crying boy who shoots tears at body horror cartoons in dungeons of poop. I won't lie, the release of the original BoI turned me off of it for about two weeks before I tried it. It's a great game and also a pretty disgusting one at a glance. Isaac lives alone with his mother on a hill, she goes insane, he dives into the cellar to escape her and it gets metaphysical from there. Despite the initial juvenile experience the storytelling is pretty well done and there's a good deal of comedy to lighten things up. It's a light twin-stick shooter rogue-like with dungeon crawling heavily inspired by the original Legend of Zelda. Enemies are all vicious little monsters constantly rushing and shooting at you and greater challenges graduate to bullet hells. Resource and risk management is crucial and the big allure of the game is the hundreds of power-ups that modify things. Combined with the randomized dungeon layout and the dozens of bosses and enemies makes every run feel new, especially as you unlock items and things change. Experimentation is key and usually a joy. Many Isaac players remember fondly those ascendant runs where all the right power ups appeared and they gleefully obliterated their foes with moisturized laser streams.

If you enjoyed the original BoI or are wondering how to start then Rebirth is a fine product. I played OG BoI to near completion(rounding out Satan clears before Cathedral was added and doing a few of those) and replaying Rebirth is enjoyable. It's a very refined and improved more-of-the-same. My only gripes are longstanding ones from the original game: some of the RNG is particularly spiteful and petty, bad runs will bore you to tears(but not extra damaging ones, hence the problem), there is obtuse design at times and some design elements are so terrible the game would benefit from direct removal. There's also a few new Rebirth specific fumbles, some of the new enemies adding tedium instead of variety(Walking Hosts should be quietly deleted with a touch of private shame) or some of the new design elements not working well, such as enemies that can attack or aggressively teleport at the player from off screen in large rooms. A sight/proximity based radius would help a lot here; if I can see the enemy and he can see me, he can use his offensive leap and I can react to it.

I'd say roughly there are about four types of BoI runs. Regular runs where you take what you can get and your skill determines how far you're going. Outstanding runs where a nice wombo combo or several beneficial gains in a row place you far ahead of the power curve and you can comfortably win, only your own hubris or carelessness posing a threat. Then there are the bad runs. The boring ones. Trying to clear rooms in the second half of the game with a low damage stat. Your power-ups don't have synergy and weren't very good to begin with. You can do it. To the game's credit there is virtually nothing you can't defeat without playing better. The real problem is the last type of run, a cursed type. A ruined run. There are several items in the game that are so awkward to use or genuinely overloaded with balancing flaws that picking them up will doom you. This can happen at any point of the run, particularly well into it. Since the game leans heavily on ""do it again you idiot"" to teach there's not a reliable way to tell without memorizing these items after picking them up. Better item descriptions or item name visibility would go a long way here, perhaps a way to discard the last power-up received(this was added for trinkets!) Or just tossing things like Cursed Eye out of the game and into patch documentation. Or the dumpster, either way.

There's just a certain level of frustration that is native to the experience. You'd expect as much from anything that would call itself rogue-like but here it often happens blindly. Now in several well made games the lows help to define the experience so that the highs feel all the better. BoI does that well at times. It's just a shame how many times BoI will slam you straight into the lowest lows for want of a tooltip or daring to experiment, going against the best nature of the game. With that said I stress that Binding of Isaac is a great game, don't get me wrong. It's worth full price. It encourages dozens of replays and comfortably does so. Just be aware that sometimes the poop covered dungeon will stink."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,Extremely good game especially if you like roguelikes. There are so many different characters and upgrades to use and also unlock as you venture through the game and you can get multiple different endings as well. The DLC's add even more content to the game (I prefer repentance because of the addition to so many more things)

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"Ah yes, a child trying to escape from his mother and her obsession with god's divinity. When I played it for the first time, which was the original flash game, I was impressed with the amount of possibilities and it started my addiction to rogue-like games. After playing Rebirth for a couple of hours, I waited for Repentance and the wait  has paid off. Repentance isn't just an expensive DLC, containing the most favourite community mod but it is also a fascinating and new experience of more possibilities and even more item combinations. The sheer amount of input in the ""DLC"" shows that the developers didn't just copy and paste Antibirth but added far more complexity in their game what Antibirth didn't have and the difficulty happens to have increased five times, which can be good or bad. One thing TBoI hasn't changed is how frustrating this damn game can be..."

Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,Hollow Knight is a video game
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,i took a look in my backyard and this bug just went and slaughtered a giant moth what the hell
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"After playing this game for 105 hours, I realized something... I am the Hollow Knight...
I started playing this so much to the point that going beyond extremely difficult bosses made me empty inside, I have no more desires and no emotions while playing this because it's like I suffered long term hypnosis and didn't realize that I spent every afternoon of my week playing again... and again... and again...
It took me a long time to decide to write a review about this game, but I can't blame myself for that, as I was too busy getting hooked on it to remember to do anything else important in my life.
I spent days forgetting to eat lunch while playing this wonder, and after Hollow Knight became my favorite game, I realized it's a path of no return... but not a path of pain like the one in the game, but a path of emotion and happiness, and that's why you should stop looking at the reviews and buy this work of art right away, because every second looking at them, it's a second longer that you're away from Hollow Knight.
Stop waiting for promotions and buy the game soon, then we'll go together Embrace the Void."
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"Hollow Knight changed the way I view video games. Just until now, I was a naïve gamer with roots in taking movies really seriously that spilled into my other hobbies, especially gaming. If there was no in-game motivation to continue playing then I would lose the desire to continue. It's the reason why I dropped so many games that would be considered ""prestigious"", where platformers would never be a consideration again after my disappointment with Mario Odyssey and Rayman Origins. Not that these games were bad or not well-made, they could have had the best platforming mechanics for all I know, but without the cinematic qualities of the games I'm used to - I dropped them. 

Then here's me on a whim, hearing about the praise this game is getting and it sitting in my library for an unspecified amount of time. I decided to play a game that was the complete antithesis to what I enjoyed - a 2D platformer Metroidvania without a narrative. I've tried to play this game at least a few times, but I never got past 20 minutes due to me being confused.

But for some reason I just felt the urge to try at least one more time. At least one more to make sure I have an opinion on this game.

Went into it with low expectations.

Turns out I loved it. This game is a top contender for why games can be considered art without trying to replicate other aspects of mediums. It is a game that can only exist as a game that doesn't borrow anything else. Platforming controls are refined to a touch, making movement and combat feel smooth and rewarding. It may be simplistic, but it is with this simplicity it excels. The combat and movement incrementally upgrade, but never complicate the fundamentals of the game.

But the best part of this game is exploration and how rewarding it is to revisit locations that were once unattainable after getting an ability. The game teases these locations frequently, but there is no indication as to where and how you get there, relying on the player's intuition to put two and two together. It does not hold your hand at all - which is why I was once lost when I first began. But that is the point: the game makes you feel lost, but rewards the feeling of being rudderless as you explore new areas without a map at first. 

Each new area is expertly designed to be a challenge to navigate without being an annoyance, but rewards exploration. The game is not easy, but it's rewarding to venture through the caves and build a pathway in your mind as to how to venture through the caves. This game relies on creating an atmosphere that is gloomy and dark, without inducing a sense of dread. It is mysterious with lore sprinkled throughout without much explanation as to what it may be. It is there without calling attention to itself, but rewards those who seek to find more information.

My only major complaint with the game is the fact that enemies do damage to you when they shouldn't, such as when they scurry away from you. But this is a nitpick at most - it does increase the tension of every encounter.

Other than that: Hollow Knight is art. It is art that changed the way I view this medium and only furthered my appreciation for gaming without a story. The most rewarding aspect is the way this game builds upon concepts and rewards intuition of the player. This game is not easy - it may be one of the hardest games I've played, but it is just so much fun to continue finding out with this game has to offer that it doesn't get in the way of enjoyment."
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"REALLY LOVE THIS GAME <3 I came to know about this game because i first played Ori and Blind Forest and thought they were similar in concept, but this game is amazing and unique in its own away, i love the story, the characters, the gameplay and especially the art style! Before i played Hollow Knight i never was a person who would play games that have tons of boss fights (i even tend to avoid them as much as possible) but HK really opened up my eyes to the joy of taking on a boss, even though it would frustrate me to have to walk the long ass distance from the last bench to where i died especially when there were platforming challenges or tough enemies to get to my shade and hopefully not die, i always felt super happy when i finally beat a boss and get whatever reward for defeating the boss. As of this review i am only at 94% completion so i am still gonna finish all the other content that i haven't touched yet like godmaster and grimm troupe, both of which i am looking foward to completing :D Im so gonna get Silk Song when it comes out. ALSO CAN I JUST SAY I LOVE THE WHOLE GAME'S SOUNDTRACK KTHXBYE"
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,Fantastic game!
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"yes, yes, yes YES a thousand times yes. 
this right here is not a game but instead a masterpiece, something that the average human brain can not understand this is something that only the mightiest of the mightiest could ever desire.

jokes aside, i think Hollow Knight was one of (if not THE) most incredible experiences i've had with a game. the perfect mix between Metroidvania and Souls-Like. If i were to list every single aspect that i loved in this game i would be writing this for hours, but i have to give imense props to the story and sound design, never been so proud of buying a soundtrack bundle as i was with this game's. this is truly a game that i've fell completely in love, and am willing to come back to it later for the 120%. Thank You, Team Cherry for making this such an amazing ride for me.

GIT GUD !"
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,So this game is really. Fuck Pantheon 5 though.
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,Yooo haha broooo yeah
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,this game i love
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"I feel old now. Not enough time to play the games I want to play to the extent I want to play them. I haven't sat down and really enjoyed Hollow Knight in a long time. Haven't revisited it to get the achievements, and I've never been interested in speedrunning of any kind. When I have time to game, it's usually with my friends, or I really hunker down and consume a single player game out of the many yet untouched in my library. I love a good story, and I miss the days when responsibilities were few and I could spend as much time as I could imagine just taking in every moment of every game that I felt like. Despite these things, I imagine one day when my hands don't work as well as they did when I was young, and responsibilities become fewer again, and time is still precious but the days empty, I will play Hollow Knight again. And I'll play it the way I did the first time. Slow, without any goals in mind, heights to reach, or anything of the sort. I'll play it again just to experience it again, because in all my years of playing across every console generation from all 3 brands from NES to the current gen and PC for nearly 30 years, likely approaching the completion of 1000 different video games, Hollow Knight is my indisputable favorite."
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,Not for everyone since it's full of bugs :)
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"Hollow Knight is a deeply moody game that sits on the threshhold of souls-like and metroidvania, taking aspects from both genres into one game. It is also a game that has no desire to hold back punches, and gets remarkably difficult in some of its optional content, demanding a level of mastery from the player in both platforming and combat. If you're looking for an 'easy' game, or a game that guides you in any degree beyond dialogues and looking at a map, then Hollow Knight is not for you.

Hollow Knight places you in the shows of a little bug, running around with a sword in a lost bug-kingdom. Soon, you get caught up in the goings on of that ancient place, as it falls to the grips of the ""Corruption"", a glowing, ghostly alien orange light that seems to infect bugs and turn them into insane, mindless creatures, but also offering them incredible strength. A taller beetle named Hornet becomes your sometimes-guide, sometimes rival through the area, along with other NPCs you'll come across. It's again, very similar to seeing the different NPCs throughout the Dark Souls game, and the comparisons come easy and often. You learn about the story in small cutscenes, snippets of dialogue, and item descriptions - something which likely sounds familiar by now.

The game has you roaming around the world, and swiftly gives you access to fast travel, and equipment to make traversing the world easier. Over time, you'll get access to double jumps, wall climbing, dashes, and more, giving you very swift movement throughout the world - though as always, backtracking will be happening, especially for those looking for high percentage clears. Combat is fast, and enemies generally have 0 i-frames whatsoever, meaning combat can be as greedy as you want it to be - something which will quickly get you kiled against the game's many bosses. Various battle techniques will become apparent, such as using your sword in the air to ""pogo"" off of enemies and spikes to bounce endlessly off their heads, or off of the spikes. This technique becomes mandatory later on for some content, so learn it early and use it constantly. Magic is very powerful, and I found great success using equipment (""Charms"") that boosted my magic power early on, later transitioning into a pure sword (""Nail"") focused build for very rapid, long range melee attacks.

The music and sound effects are wonderful, especially in the Deepnest, a downright spooky and spine-tingling area of the game. While jump scares aren't built into the game, there are several points where the game works to make your skin crawl - but just as many other places where it wants you to admire an ancient kingdom, deep, deep underground, covered in dust but in many ways unharmed by time. Every area ha a color pallette unique to it, and area transitions are readily identifiable - at all times the player is alwys perfectly aware of where they are, and how areas connect to each other, which is critical for a metroidvania. It's also doubly crucial, as seeing where you are on the minimap actually requires you to use a Charm equipment slot, which you can only do at a bench/""Bonfire"". This is a controversial decision, and I'll openly admit I spent the vast majority of the game with it equipped to make my life easier.

There is a very large amount of sequence breaking that can occur throughout the game. It is wildly open even from the very start, and openly welcomes attempts to circumvent its usual progression. For those who play metroidvanias to do things like that, as long as you've got the skill and guts to pull it off, Hollow Knight is willing to accomodate. There is also a vast amount of optional content in the game, both story related, and non-main story, in the form of several DLCs, including boss rushes, and an entire side story about a mysterious carnival. The game also commits my least favorite thing about metroidvanias, which is ""invisible walls with nothing around to point out that you can walk through them"", so be ready to press against walls from time to time, looking for side entries and special hidden areas.

I would recommend Hollow Knight to anyone looking for a thoughtful, and challenging Metroidvania, especially for anyone who is willing to put in the time to do all of the optional and extra content - there is a wealth of things to accomplish and see, and it'd be a shame to leave it half done."

It's very difficult and when you accomplish something,it always feels rewarding!

Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game.

I've sunk 30 hours into it already and still only have a 70% completion score.
The problem is, only about 10 of those hours or so were actually spent exploring new areas, fighting new bosses, learning new skills... you know, the fun stuff.

The majority of your playtime in this game is going to be backtracking. And I get it, it's a Metroidvania. But this is too much. Too unclear. Too many dead-ends. You check your map and see there were fifteen paths where an obstacle blocked you, but there's no way you're going to remember what exactly each obstacle was. So when you FINALLY stumble upon a new ability, you have to recheck all your old obstructions, one-by-one. Powerups/other useful items are given way too infrequently. Even after 30 hours of gameplay, the story is still pretty cryptic.

Basically there's too much backtracking. My sense of direction in games may not be the best but come on. The majority of your gameplay shouldn't be wandering through the same areas swatting the same mooks you've had to encounter one hundred million times over and over and over again.

The actual gameplay (when you're actually encountering something new, that is) is amazing and crisp. I absolutely adore the art style and aesthetic. The combat is tight and strategic, frantic, and exciting. So much to love about this game. But God, so much to hate also.

I recommend keeping a detailed map open in MS paint where you can fill in notes along the way to help you remember certain obstacles. Or just use a walkthrough. Because fuuuuccccckkkk all this backtracking."
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"This game is amazing in every way. Beautiful art, great world design, interesting characters, and fantastic music."
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"Great game, with a lot of fun exploring. You can get to the end without too much of a struggle but there are some optional bosses the really can fuck you up."

Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"Everything about this game is an absolute master piece. The pinnacle of the metroidvania genre, hollow knight's beautiful art style, amazing sound design, and subtle world building suck you into the world of Hollownest. The immersive world compels you to explore every nook and cranny of the expansive map for hours, with secrets and treasures hiding at every turn. Not only is the world of Hollownest brilliantly realized, the simple and seamlessly fluid mechanics make the combat and movement of Hollow Knight an absolute blast, easy to learn and difficult to master, you'll have a hard time finding a platformer with a more elegant combat system. With so much to explore and with 3 FREE DLC's Hollowknight is a one of a kind experience. Everything in this game is so brilliantly executed I find it hard to put into words, it's such a wonderful experience with so much to offer I would gladly sink another 100 hours into this game.

Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,Cool
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"Hollow Knight is an interesting game. Its from a genre I do not like, had moments where I thought it was messing up massively, and has a story I could barely decipher. Yet I feel like it is worthy of all the praise it gets?
Hollow Knight is a game with an incredible amount of charm, depth, character and personality. Every new location has a unique aspect to it and gives off a new vibe. I've never seen a game get its atmosphere down so perfectly like this game has. 
The best part of all of it though was the boss fights present, with a great amount of challenge and reward. I looked forward to every fight and even though there were one or two things that annoyed me about some, every time I wanted to keep playing and wanted to beat the boss. Aside from [spoiler] the true final boss being locked behind the first one  [/spoiler] , I have no faults with the combat, the bosses and the fights that come from them. 
The game is incredibly consistent with every aspect of it, and it's an impressive accomplishment for a small team like Team Cherry. This game easily beats out many games that have hundreds of thousands put into to develop them. 
The genre and game might not be for everyone, but I was pleasantly suprised too. I would advise anyone else to dive in the same as me, and if you need a guide try it that way. There is too much to miss.
I am now putting silksong on my list of games I am very excited for."
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,One of the best games ever made. I just hope they remove primal aspid shit in new game.
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"If you are thinking about buying it, do it. 15 euro is too cheap for this. To be honest, this is the game, for which I would pay atleast 40 euros. This is a masterpiece. Beautiful world, story, characters, gameplay, etc. Can't wait for the sequel :)"

Throughout both journeys into Hallownest, both on normal and steel soul mode, every single aspect of the game has not failed to impress me. The characters, the bosses, the music, the artstyle, even the world layout itself is all so unique and charming in its own little ways. This game was my first adventure into the metroidvania genre, and I regret not playing it, as well as completing it, a lot sooner then I did. I hope this review helps push you to purchase and play Hollow Knight, so you too can descend into the ancient yet vibrant kingdom of Hallownest."
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,I've done all ending and most of what you can do on PS4 and I bought the game on PC too just so i can use mods and stuff this game is amazing one of the best games I've played 10/10 would recommend

Undertale,RPG,391540,"Undertale, such a young classic. It have the biggest community i've ever seen. To this day, there are some people who create fangames, remixes, alternative universes, animations, and they will create even more. But not that it surprises me, I know why it is that way. It's just awesome. Toby Fox put here iconic characters, tons of secrects, great gameplay, perfect balance between silliness and seriousness, and beautiful story. I personally beaten this game thrice, but every time with this same ending, because in the end of this game, you feel that you helped them, and even they are just a game characters, you can feel the bond with them. Maybe thats a reason why it have that strong community too. This game helped to change gaming industry and in many todays games we can see inspiration or easter eggs from undertale. 

If you want to see why this game become so popular, and check if you agree with my opinion, buy it, I reccomend it, with all of the community, especially XTALE."

It's also easy to get smashed by enemies, especially in certain situations.


Standard review:
I've not really ever played a game quite like this, so I've not really much to compare it to, but if Seinfeld (or similar) were made into an RPG, it would be something like this. It's meant to seem more comedic than dark and serious, and it pulls that off very well, even if there are some elements that are not clearly explained and/or can be figured out easily.

The battle mechanics are quite unique; I've never encountered any other system like it. Being able to spare one's opponent is actually a nice touch, though it never works right off the bat, apparently. There's also the defense system, which for me, is one of those things I'm fond of, but I'd improve upon in a couple ways:

1) Larger box for multiple enemies (since they all attack at once and it really makes it difficult to avoid attacks at times)
2) More chances for healing when being kind/merciful (often times one grabs the green only to get hit for more damage than what was healed and that's just bad-especially at 20 MAX HP)

The different soul/heart types are neat and those I'd not alter in any way, but DAMN, are you SLOW as MOLASSES when you do platforming (blue). Caused me to overestimate many of my jumps. Eh, nitpicky.

Ah, yes, the main character. Very ambiguous, kinda reminds me of another novella main character I love, only much cuter and far more benign on the surface (nothing is said about their past before the trip down into Mt. Ebott)...and the fact that everyone refers to the main character as they/them is a really good idea considering the main character is the 'silent protagonist' type (is there really a protagonist here?).

What name did I give the main character? 'Jess'. Not sure why you actually care, but yeah.

There's a lot more I could say, but it would be considered prattling.

So, play it. It's worth getting. Worth the frustration, worth Flowey's condescending and very inaccurate wisdom."

Undertale,RPG,391540,this is the best game i have ever played.
Undertale,RPG,391540,I just can't find any words to explain how special this game is...
Undertale,RPG,391540,Supremely creative. Got scared at the part with the creepy flower. Hoping to get over my anthophobia some day.

Undertale,RPG,391540,idk funny skeleton i guess
Undertale,RPG,391540,My favorite game. I don't really have anything to say that hasn't been said already.
Undertale,RPG,391540,it's good.
Undertale,RPG,391540,"This game has been one of if not the best games I have ever played, in fact I feel rude calling it a game as it is a work of art."
Undertale,RPG,391540,cried.
Undertale,RPG,391540,It is a very fun game that requires skill!
Undertale,RPG,391540,literally my favorite game of all time lol
Undertale,RPG,391540,its a good game
Undertale,RPG,391540,Awesome
Undertale,RPG,391540,"I think that Undertale falls into a certain category of games where you either play it blindly or you just won't be able to experience the game for what truly is, since this story really relies on shock value and putting the player out of his confort zone, if you go into the game already knowing the plostwists and what perspective the game wants you too take it, will in my opinion, ruin half of the experience, and I say half because I do think this game stands out as an RPG alone.

If you are looking for a funny and entertaining story, with lovable and quirky characters, Undertale is just for you! And although you may be desmotivated by the graphics (I like them, but I can understand why some people would think this was made by a monkey who just saw 2 or 3 videos on how to work with Unity). I can assure you that the game uses his aesthetics into his favor (either for jokes or for some new creative way to aproach the combat, dialogue, etc..)

The game also has great music! Mainly because the creator of the game, Toby Fox works as a composer, you can expect to have some real bangers waiting for you (if you want some backgroud, he was the one who composed ""I Miss You - EarthBound 2012"") and you can expect the game to be filled with those ""Homestuck soundtracks alike"" music, either in battle or just wandering around a town, the music of this game is something that never ceases to impress me.

With that being said, I do not recomend you go into this game with the ideia of playing an hardcore RPG, the combat system is something that I find pretty interesting (being a mix of a bullet hell with an actual RPG) and fun! But I don't think you really get ""hard"" battles unless you really seek for those (something that I can't really say much, since I feel it's a major spoiler for the story itself).

In any case, if you are looking for a fun storytelling game, then consider giving Undertale a go! Because I truly belive that this game as something for everyone to enjoy, being the battles, the story, or just the random jokes, this game truly is a classic when we talk about both RPGs and/or Indie Games.

10/10"
Undertale,RPG,391540,wat da dog doin
Undertale,RPG,391540,"This game is the greatest game i've ever played lol, thanks for making this game, i love ittt."
Undertale,RPG,391540,"This game is not the best ""Video game"" If by that, you refer only to the gameplay, the gameplay is not bad so much rather it's mediocre, so if that's not your thing, I wouldn't recommend this.

Overall, this game is an experience, one like legitimately none. The Game is meant for the story, pay close attention to it, and make yourself get lost within the world of UNDERTALE.  The Characters are deeply Fleshed out and so emotive, all are different, for instance, undyne is a Fearless warrior, she Mimics the ""Arnold Schwarzenegger"" Stereotype, however learning more about her shows her past and how incredible it was.   another example is alphys, a very nerdy Girl who has made HUGE mistakes in the past that i'm not going to get into for your sake.

But let's Address the Elephant in the room, sans.   Ohhh boy, this is probably the reason you ever Read this Review in the First place, or even looked at the store page, you've already all seen his Fight because of all the memes and i'm sorry to say, but seeing that fight means you've already seen one of the most shocking spoilers in the game.  Basically, sans is one of the most confusing characters in the game, only being beaten by [REDACTED] which is literally only very rarely ever found in people's runs ever.   

I can't get into every aspect of why this game is perfect, but let's just say, if you're bored, depressed, or have any mental issue ever, i recommend this game HIGHLY."

I fell through a cave on Mt. Ebott I faced an evil talking flower in a pot Explains the plot, wants me dead, wants me to rot Toriel saves me, takes me to her home And hooks me up with a brand-new monster phone Leaves me alone, but I escape and meet some bones

Should I be a pacifist? Or should I use my fists? I'm feeling evil, think I'll kill them all

I'm homicidal, and I've got a taste I want to wipe out the Monster race I've got no patience, got no resolve I will slaughter, screw the dialogue

Undertale,RPG,391540,it's an amazing game! it's got a great soundtrack and i actually cried while playing it :]
Undertale,RPG,391540,"I played all major endings of this game and enjoyed every single one. I even downloaded the soundtrack because the songs were so catchy. Undertale is a turn based game (sort of) which I usually hate but the ""combat"" in this game is not like any game I've played before. It ranged from funny to very very difficult (you know who I'm talking about) and it was really fun to play from start to finish. It has a more interesting story than most games with a decent sense of humour, lots of secrets, foreshadowing etc etc. It was worth playing all the major endings and I recommend others to do the same."

This is a game in which you have a choice in what you'd like to do. Wanna kill everyone? You can do that. Wanna spare everyone? You can do that too!

Each time you play, you're going to find something different. Whether it be a dialogue thingymajiggy, or something else.

This game is really fun and I recommend it!"

"Papers, Please",Simulation,239030,"This game is mainly based around ethics/morality. Do you let through a person needing medical treatment but missing papers, or do you reject her in order to feed your family. Do you support a militant organization against the oppressive government in hopes of a better future, or do you work against them to maintain the ""safer"" status quo. The checking of papers essentially establishes the setting in which these ethical choices are made in, along with adding the additional challenge of keeping track of all the ever-changing rules for admission. Some will find the monotonous document inspection a turn-off, but that was not a problem for me."

"Papers, Please",Simulation,239030,"I think the only thing I disliked story-wise was the ability to detain people over their gender not matching their documents. I get it, but bleh. However, it's a hilarious and hard game that gets easier as you repeatedly play the story.

Mechanics wise, it's hard to move my mouse fast enough, but that's probably just my mouse."
Grimm,Indie,252150,"If you like dark fairy tales then this is a game for you. Lots of different stories that are well known and some that are not, are twisted by an angry dwarf called grimm. It is an easy game to get into, you just run around and corrupt every happy little character into a twisted version of themselves. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to cause chaos and have fun."
Grimm,Indie,252150,"For me, this game is a guilty pleasure. It's not the best or complex game but its a fine casual game for those who enjoy games where you grow more powerful and warp the world around you.

The concept of returning to classic tales to their gritty roots is a fun concept and it's great seeing the world twist around you. It's like playing De Blob or Katamari Damacy but with lower stakes. It's amusing to see the contrast as Grimm corrupts each story but the novelty wears off after awhile. The few platforming sections aren't that great but the levels do offer plenty of variety.

Overall, I think this game is okay and worth at least playing the demo. It offers plenty of content but it can feel monotonous at times."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"Real men know how to cry, get ready for the feels. Make sure you are alone when playing."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"Came for the perfect game, remained one of the best and most emotional games I have ever played. Games like this are not usually my genre. But if you don't just click through quickly and take a minute to think about it, you'll experience a really beautiful and emotional game. 10/10."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,It is hard to write a review through eyes filled with tears
To the Moon,Indie,206440,I recommend to everyone who loves storytelling to play this one. One of the most emotional and beautiful stories I've seen in a video game by far. It will make you cry. Proof that graphics don't need to be great & you don't need a big budget to make a masterpiece. 10/10
To the Moon,Indie,206440,I'm not sad.  I HAVE SOMETHING IN MY EYE.
To the Moon,Indie,206440,This has been my favorite game for nearly a decade now.
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"Emotional, puzzle-like story with some pleasing to ear pieces of music. Big thanks to my good friend who recommended to me this adventure to the moon."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"the game left me in goosebumps, thats all i can say about ""To The Moon""."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"If I had a nickel for Every time I got to play a game with an emotional story where A female character mentioned about Light houses, then i'd Have 2 nickels. Which is not a lot, but I am not complaning. Both made me cry."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"this is the 40000th review of to the moon

Okay actual review though, one of the best games I've ever played. It quite literally is only behind its sequel, Finding Paradise. While there isn't much gameplay, the story is amazing and makes the lack of gameplay worth it. It's more like a visual novel rather than a game, but it's still amazing nonetheless."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"To the moon is one of the RPG Maker engine classics, its short but sweet and since its gameplay is very simple and it's a fun story to experience by anyone. if its on sale definitely pick it up if you're interested, it will put a smile on your face once you're done playing."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"As the game description says, this is a story driven game about two doctors going back through a dying man's memories to artificially fulfill his last wish. Yes, it's a pixel art game. Yes, the controls are a bit clunky. But the story is out of this world. I don't want to say anything else to avoid spoilers so you just have to trust me on this one, you need to experience the story yourself. i wholly recommend this game."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,Played and cried like 8 times. Absolutely fantastic game!
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"[h1]Just perfect plot combined with reverse storytelling[/h1]
Fking Shit game cant see no shit on my screen with the fking tears in my fking eyes fk u developers fuk u Kan Gao FUCKFUCKFUCK"
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"No need to worry if you're bad at games, since the focus of this game is the story rather than the gameplay. It's very heartfelt and memorable, and makes me cry pretty much every time I play it, watch someone else play it, or even think about it. (Protip: If the solution to a puzzle doesn't seem immediately obvious, try clicking the diagonal before anything else. In my experience, the diagonal is the most confusing part and getting it out of the way early usually makes the puzzle very easy.)"
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"I wish I knew where to start. But I guess I'll start with the fact that I've played and loved many games of varying genres over the years, but this is the first time I've taken a moment to actually write a review on one. This game was just THAT good and carried so much meaning. I can't stop thinking about it. I know some people complain about ""the lack of game play"" and state that ""the puzzles are too easy, and they get bored without more of a challenge"" ... fine. But personally, I can't relate because when I dive into a visual novel, I expect an immersive story and to FEEL things above everything else, and that's exactly what I got from this game. 

If you love a unique, overwhelmingly beautiful, poetic, joyful, sad, even at times twisted and haunting, but still emotionally rewarding and heartwarming story: don't hesitate.
The dialogue was well written, bringing humor and bits of romance into a tragedy and time of death. I not only fell in love with several quotes and beautiful scenes from this story, but also spent about an hour or so crying at the end of it. Not sure if it was from sadness, or joy, or a combination of both.. but this story made me reflect on life in a deep way and left me wanting more. 
The added dlc episodes were simple but great too and I'm now about to play the follow up ""finding paradise"" and I'm really hopeful that I'll feel even half of what I felt from playing To the Moon.

To make a long story short: if you are a human with empathy and feelings, and just want a relaxing visual novel game that you can play to take a break from your busy life or whatever chaotic combat-heavy games you usually find yourself playing: this is it. Relax, soak it in, embrace it, and feel the emotions. It's kind of therapeutic, really. 
 I recommend this game now, and would 100x again. 
Give it a shot."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,Beautiful enough to make a grown man cry
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"To the Moon is a special game.

The story is heartwarming yet sad. This will be your main reason for playing. I found the dialect to be well written and interesting. There were parts that genuinely made me laugh out loud while playing.
The two main characters were fine enough as a vessel to experience the story through but I didn't find them to be particular likeable. I was mainly playing to experience John and Rivers story.

I found the game play to be fairly repetitive. While I appreciate the mini games when going back through the memories, they lost their charm after the 4th or 5th one. Other than that it's a simple click here and read journey. It worked well enough but if the game was any longer I guess it would be more of an issue. 

I did have slow down issues while playing on a notebook for some reason, but changing to a beta alternative version through steam solved that. I would recommend for the story and music alone."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,An amazing game with a story that is just beautiful.
To the Moon,Indie,206440,a beautiful story. i love this game so much <3
To the Moon,Indie,206440,My F***ing lord this was a flawless game
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"Another worthy addition to Games Are Art movement.
A game which shows you, you don't need AAA, blockbuster graphics, action, explosiions and everything else to distract you from the story.

A game where story is king and crafting of believable characters shows how you can immerse yourself in the world. Beautiful music and writing that makes you follow everything that happens and invests you in their fate.

Interesting decissions going for the story arc will fill you with all kind of emotions, and the ending opens up a discussion about morality and how little things can impact your whole life.

It's a great buy at 4.99.
I trully enjoyed the game after getting over the RPG Maker graphics, but once I got hooked with the characters and story, it became a real gem."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"""I think they're lighthouses.... stuck on the far end of the sky. 
They can see the other lighthouses out there, and they want to talk to them. 
But they can't.... all they can do is shine their lights from afar. 
So that's what they do. They shine their lights at other lighthouses and at me. 
Because one day, I'm going to befriend one of them.""

To the Moon,Indie,206440,Overwhelming story. That's it. That's all.
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"You play as two doctors traversing backwards through a dying man's memories to artificially fulfill his last wish.
Story is emotional, soundtracks are great... 
If this game had various puzzles it could be a classic.

“Because one day.. I’m going to befriend one of them.”

3/5"
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"So I played this a second time after several years. Also sat through most of it another time, playing with a friend, so ~3x.

Back in the day I voted for this as a steam award for 'tear-jerker'. It'll make you cry, but feel so fulfilling by the end.

No spoilers: You play as a pair of ~'memory editing doctors'. As a client lies on their deathbed, you go into their memories, going far back in 'time' to change something and make a whole new life, existing only in their memory as they die.

It's a story of learning memories of a client backwards, then seeing the change (quickly) forwards, living out a life-wish that might never have come true in real life.

Be prepared with tissues. Learn a life, and maybe a few life lessons. A quiet game, enjoyable adventure."
FTL: Faster Than Light,Strategy,212680,"FTL is the type of game where it seems impossible to win on Easy mode, at first, then you play a bunch of times and learn and realize that Easy mode is too easy. Then you try it on Normal mode and and it seems impossible again, then you play a bunch of times and realize that normal is too easy as well, and then you've played hundreds of hours. 

It's a great game with great music and sufficient difficulty to keep you coming back for more."
FTL: Faster Than Light,Strategy,212680,"fun game! gun go pew pew pew, beam go beeeeeewwwwww. ship go BLOWa!"
FTL: Faster Than Light,Strategy,212680,FTL is a timeless masterpiece.

FTL: Faster Than Light,Strategy,212680,"A masterpiece. So many ways to play this game to get the most out of it in a style and approach which suits you. There are so many AAA games which I have bought but never started because I just keep firing up FTL (see hours played...). I also love their follow up game ""Into The Breach"" but for some reason the space nomad feel of FTL really resonates with me."

Beat Saber,Indie,620980,i feel like anakin with the younglings!
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"Beat Saber is the only game that makes me dread every update.

I know the devs are just trying to improve the game, but it's insulting that they periodically break the game and all the mods and don't even offer a ""betas"" option on steam so I can avoid updates until all hot fixes are in and mod support is ready.

Is there any way I can just totally disable updates on steam for beat saber? I don't care what fancy new features they want to add. I just want to hit blocks with my mods enabled.

This *would* have been a review gushing review in favor of beat saber if it wasn't for this persistent issue. I love the game, I just hate how rarely it allows me to play it."
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,one of the better vr games
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,Late May 2021 update broke the game. Only get to play one song if you're lucky before the screen goes black. Who tested this hot garbage?
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,please help my arms are in constant pain
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,Recent update broke the game and made the load times insanely long. I use mods to download custom maps because the base game includes an embarrassingly low number of quality ones. I literally cannot even start a map anymore. The game just crashes on start and my disappointment is immeasurable.
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"Of course I recommend, nearly worth buying a headset just for Beat Saber... No sane person would do that, right? ...Right?...?"
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"This update completely broke the game. Long ""waiting"" screens, drops back to Steam VR Home, and worst...goes black requiring full restart after every song, and sometimes even between menus or after a pause. No mods, running on a 3080 / 10900k installed on a samsung 980 Pro m.2 SSD. No help from company and Steam prevents rolling back to a non-broken version. Do NOT buy until/unless resolved."
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"fun game but the songs it comes with are terrible and mainstream generic sounding, but you can mod it and add your own music if you're comfortable with it and fixing every time the game does an update. This game creator is now owned by facebook now if you're curious
as of right now for most people the game isn't working from a new update
if you buy it only buy on sale."
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"good workout
"
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,Hands down my fav VR game!
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"New updates feel a bit bad for the game.

Been away for a while, only to come back to a worse optimised game than when i left.... What happend?

If you want to play it properly, find a guide on how to downgrade to 1.13.4"
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,At this point it's pretty clear that the developers have nothing but contempt for the community.  The modders are the ones who made this game truly great.  This latest update is a blatant cash grab that offers nothing more than yet another overpriced DLC with trash-tier music and breaks all the mods in the process.
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"Still broken.
Using the test version. (1.16.1_TEST)
High lag. 
Black screens.

Beat Saber,Indie,620980,Last update totally broke the game. Don't push broken shit out to your players.
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"Worst update I ever experienced.

This horrible update just made over night, and lots of people are reporting crashes.
 
My case, game actually got started, but every single click I made, I saw steam VR idle background every time.
Beat Saber was running so slow, and my eyes were getting tired by switching scenes.

Every update so far, I didn't like it much, yet I could bare few days till the mode gets updated.
However, this time I couldn't wait. I mean, the mode couldn't fix the fundamental problem with loading and switching scenes between in game and steam VR loading scenes. I spent few hours to downgrade, and I went back to 1.15, I am so satisfied with this downgrade.

Great works Beat Saber Team, you guys motivated me to downgrade this game.
I will continue play Beat Saber, cuz this has so much fun to play, but I am not sure I will keep updating the game :/"
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"I actually like this game, I just can't recommend it when they keep bringing it to the edge of unplayability with a patch... again and again.  If they can release 3 updates in a row without breaking the game then maybe I'll consider making this review positive."
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,Maybe just maybe test your game before you release a new update breaking everything...
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"The reason why this is ""Overwhelmingly positive"" n terms of reviews is because they haven't played for long

The developers care not about how your version of the game works, and put updates with ONLY soundtracks to buy proving that they are just doing it for money, no bug fix no help with tracking the best for tracking you'll ever get is version 1.13.0 at least for me anyway,

the other reviews most of them anyway (not all) are under 100 hours of play time, when the more you play the more the devs smile at how much you're trying to actually play, the highest scores now unreachable at version 1.15.0 because of the fact that they have slowed down the blade movements, now the blades are too slow causing (if you swing too fast) for the blade to practically blink from one point to another but since you know you swung it you don't recognise it has happened until you notice the bad hit or miss pop up,

fix your game properly, and stop using it for a shit excuse for a cash grab, if covid is the problem for not actually fixing anything, then TOUGH FUCKING SHIT the whole world is affected and you think you can be lazy by just updating the game for nothing, and ruining what was already there, Either fix this shit, or wait till covid is done"

Beat Saber,Indie,620980,They broke it
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"Recently purchased the game, and when it works the game is great.

However i currently can't recommend it as i constantly get a black screen, it will work fine for 1 song, then anything after that loads a black screen. i can hear everything but can't see it. I have tried multiple fixes but nothing works."
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"The most exercise i have had in years

10/10"
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,My arms hurt
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"I absolutely, profoundly, unequivocally, LOVE this game. It is pretty much my all time favourite game. 

BUT, it is regularly let down by not engaging the modding community. It is ONLY as successful as it is, because of custom song functionality. 

The ModAssistant team say: don't leave negative reviews because the devs are just doing their job by releasing updates that break mods. This is perfectly true, and I am of course, a big fan of exciting feature updates! 

HOWEVER, this suggests that it's impossible to provide updates without breaking mods. This is NOT true. There are a million different ways to enable the modders, (who obviously aren't paid to keep their mods updated, and are dong so out of the profound kindness of their hearts) to keep their mods updated, so everything doesn't break for months after engine/tech debt updates. It is a problem that has been solved umpteen times elsewhere across gaming history, and not doing so is a calculated decision by the developers, and for that reason, I cannot recommend the game until it's addressed. 

Get a beta program, or give modders early builds, or SOMETHING, for heaven's sake. It's absolute madness that this is a problem that hasn't been addressed, especially with the backing of bleedin' Oculus and Facebook. Stop focusing on how to monetise the game, and get your house in order first, please, please, please! 

Please stop making it so hard to love you :("

It's literally plastered on any VR promotional material and for good reason, and once you go into the game, it's even better than you believed, then you realise you can also download custom songs and get cool new sabers and it just is amazing."
Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"Easily the console-seller of the VR industry. A must-have for everyone with a VR headset. There's a little bit of a disparity in difficulty between Expert and Expert+, but on the whole it's worth the challenge. Great base game already, but the best part is the modding community. They'll make custom songs, sabers, tweaks, and everything you want in this game happen. Hell, somebody mapped the entire Shrek movie to create a 1 and a half hour level. And even the modding interface is faster and better than Nexus mods."

Be informed and make your own decision."

Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"This is a must have if you ever get a VR, it is basic, you swing the sabers and hit the boxes in the directions given by the arrows. But the experience is simply fenomenal, from the tracks to the satisfying rumble every time you hit a note, this game is insanely polished. 

Another plus is the mods, you will probably end up engaging with them sooner or later as the difficulty of the tracks, even on expert plus, tend to get rather easy overtime (that said the camellia pack has good difficulty and it comes with the game). Keep in mind that these mods tend to break after big updates but it only takes a few weeks for them to come back online.
Regarding the dlc, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially if you plan to get everything, I would suggest you beat the tracks that come with the game before considering buying those songs, unless you really like a band in which case it is up to you when to buy them."

Beat Saber,Indie,620980,i wish i could play the game i installed the game played for 2 hours and then the next day it stops working ever time i try loading a song it crashes and i don't have mods installed at all so my game should not be broke  but it not working after the update and the only resone it negative on steam is because i only have it for the PlayStation and runs good on the quest runs fine no problem but on steam just nothing cant even play the game and i have a 3060 and ryzen 9 so im good on vr so plez fix and stop add bts bullshit

Conceptually brilliant, one of the most enjoyable things to play in VR, but sadly getting worse with every update.

How so? Disregard for what made a good game into a great one - the modding community.

The game's development is heading more and more towards a microtransaction based cashgrab. Every update increases the visibility of all the new pop-songs you haven't bought yet. Small technical improvements are sometimes added, but are usually quite insignificant-, and sometimes a blatant copy of what the modding community has created. 

Whilst this in itself wouldn't necessarily warrant a negative review, breaking the game with every update does. Especially when there's no option to disable or even postpone the updates. 

When you've modded the game to fit your specific pleasures, every update will disable all those features. Even when the update is just some new songs available for purchase. Being unable to play because there's no opt-out from the update is a big disappointment -every- -single- -time-. Especially with a game that serves as a quick daily workout. 

I realise modding is not everyone's cup of tea, but from my perspective, it is part of what has made this game popular in the first place. The mods and custom songs increase the long term playability by an order of magnitude. Everybody I know that did mod the game is still playing it, whilst none of the people who stuck to the ""pure"" version bother with it anymore.

One consolidation is the entertainment value in reading the comments on any update (steam, reddit, ...). Go ahead and try and find a positive opinion :-). 

Kudos to the original creators for the concept, and many thanks to the modding community for making all the wonderful things they do. If you're not familiar with the game, it's definitely worth a try, but don't be surprised if in the long run the facebook-controlled management will squeeze all the enjoyment out of what could've remained something wonderful."

        [td]Gameplay Loop[/td]
        [td]10[/td]
	[td]Okay, I was not expecting to like this game as much as I did. At all. I'd heard praise but I still had pretty contained expectations. But the gameplay loop is almost faultless. And it's because of this player-driven layered approach to the design. On layer 1 you could breeze through the levels pretty easily for the most part, to just get to the end. But of course, who's gonna do that right? There's strawberries scattered throughout the levels and while they're optional - they will act as the core challenge for most players. But it doesn't stop there. Then you have special casette levels which are music-centric, and unlock B-sides to every level which are WTFFF? And did I mention C-sides??? Like some sick monster who wanted to make each and every player feel sexually inept on their own level designed this game - but it's still so perfect. The game doesn't kick you down for failing, but makes you embrace failure as only a stepping stone towards inevitable success. And that philosophy is baked in every aspect - and executed so very well. If you're even vaguely interested in this - please give Celeste a try.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Narrative[/td]
        [td]8[/td]
	[td]Where I found myself surprised the most was the narrative, actually. It started off looking like some generic everyday story that most indie games would use to move the game ahead, but it actually has some really nice introspective tranquil moments. While I was initially put off by the black and white ""okay so this is your devil form with all your bad qualities ha ha ha"" aspect - I got around to it during the course of the game. I do think the dialogue was a little too cheesy and I think I would've rated it higher with even less dialogue and more food for thought. Why I give this an 8 though is not because of the writing, but because of how the game translated the metaphors of ""running from your demons"" or ""fighting them head on"" or ""finally embracing yourself for who you are"" and ""grasping for that last straw of hope"" into gameplay. It takes these abstract themes of self doubt, rage, anxiety, persistence and somehow creates them into a platforming level each time. A really good marriage of story and gameplay.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Visuals[/td]
        [td]7[/td]
	[td]I really like how the game looks. The art style complements the themes very well, and the characters are well-drawn and distinct. Important things in the world stand out visually, and the hair color being used for gameplay reasons is really good as well. One of the best-looking pixel-art games IMO. I do think they could've added a little more distinct visual cues for stamina running out, maybe make it optional?[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Mechanics[/td]
        [td]9[/td]
	[td]I might update this to a 10 eventually, or when I inevitably return to the game. The mechanics are pretty much perfect. The movement is tight, there is no useless slip to the character, the different elements it introduces are well done. But while there's almost no objective fault with the mechanics as such, there are 2 things I want to note though. One - Caroline's head doesn't have a hitbox, which ends up me going through things that should have killed me, but don't. And getting used to that makes me think I can use that but since there is no visual distinction anymore, it's easy to hit that arbitrary hitbox inside Caroline's neck or wherever in the body. Another is a bit more personal, but unlike a lot of other top-tier games I've played where I don't even feel like I'm holding the controller anymore - I very much had this realization almost throughout Celeste. Like I knew I was controlling a video game interface. Maybe it was because of the weird reverse jump thing I don't want to do but the character does anyway when I press jump while hanging on a surface? This is the reason I think I could possibly bump it to 10, as it could very well be me not being used to this mechanic and a couple little things like that - because the airborne platforming felt smooth af the whole time.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Challenge[/td]
        [td]10[/td]
	[td]As I said in the first section, the challenges are well layered. So anyone can choose how hard they want the game to be depending on their level of experience and skill with video games. This IMO is one of the game's biggest strengths, because it respects player agency while also adding replay value - since I don't think anyone playing blind like me could possibly catch each and every thing the game has to offer. It might be one of the hardest games I've ever played, and I still never found myself raging somehow. That's how much the game eases you into the systems. It gives you challenges that make you say ""that's impossible lmao"" and then shows you how you were capable of it all along. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Variety[/td]
        [td]9[/td]
	[td]The game has just 2 core mechanics - climbing on walls using a stamina meter and an air dash. And it builds these 2 mechanics throughout the course of the campaign, and keeps introducing new mechanics and tools one after another. And all of them are very top tier quality, except maybe the hotel level, where the element only seemed to be ""touch thing and you die"". But apart from that, every new level changed the way you traverse the map, change the way you reach to strawberries and change the way the air dash is contextualized. And for once, a game puts its best content in the last chapter. Brilliant variety.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Mapping[/td]
        [td]9[/td]
	[td]The level design in this game is god tier. The levels harmonize perfectly with the new element that has been introduced, and a lot of them leave enough room to take 'shortcuts' to be faster or do things slightly your way. I enjoyed finding the subtle hints of the secrets that were hidden throughout the game - but some that I found by pure accident felt like they could only be found this way - pure accident. It was the illusory wall kind of thing like with Dark Souls - but sometimes with no hints on which wall to bang IMO. And I don't mean every secret should be a shining through a crack on the wall, but say there was one where you're riding the red ball  to the left and i mistakenly pressed up and dash by mistake, and it turns out there's a secret room there. And that part was visually indistinguishable from the rest of the map. I might think differently on a revisit when I pay more attention, but that's what I think rn.   [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Sound[/td]
        [td]9[/td]
	[td]It's kind of annoying how this game is pretty much faultless across all categories ngl. Everything from the mechanics, to the challenge, to music to the themes are all so well done and go with the singular core idea. The music has a very retro feel with the composition being distinct enough that I could hear it anywhere and say ""ah ok celeste music"" and that's more than most games can say[/td]

        [td]Interface[/td]

Celeste,Indie,504230,"""its a mastahpiece for yo wallet"" - videogamedunkey

Celeste has nailed the difficulty aspect of game design like no other platformer. Each chapter is composed of a series of screens. When you die you go back to the beginning of the screen. That's it, no lives, no gameovers, nothing. Just brush it off and try again. But with each try you'll learn something new, or get lucky and get just a little bit further than last time. So you get more enticed than frustrated. You want to see how far you can get this time, you can feel yourself learning the screen through each try, breezing through difficult sections that seemed impossible five minutes ago.

And so the game leads you on. The main story, collecting strawberries, the hearts, the Core, the B-sides, the C-sides and the epilogue chapter, Farewell. There's so much game to be played, and it just gets crazier and crazier, and harder and harder with an endless set of mechanics and creative twists on them. But it never feels completely out of reach, as you get familiarized and grow as a player.

I feel Celeste only falters difficulty-wise on the C-sides and part of Farewell. There are some screens in them that are not exactly difficult, just long. So they'll take your while not because they present an impossible challenge, but a series of moderate challenges you have to take without missing. Then it can get pretty frustrating learning a part when it takes 3-15 minutes between each time you are able to get there. The relief of finally getting them was still pretty sweet though.

Celeste is also much more than a difficult, but rewarding game. One could praise it's story, plot, characters, soundtrack, and a lot more. But the challenge was what kept me coming back for 76 hours of playtime before getting all achievements, all for less than a box of chicken nuggets. Regardless of the currency you're buying it from or if it's on sale or not, this is the best cost-benefit deal in Steam"
Celeste,Indie,504230,Just use funicular next time
Celeste,Indie,504230,"My favorite game!
I like to call it ""The hardest game anyone can beat"" - because its definitely challenging, but each challenge is only a bit more than the last and never feels out of reach. Made me feel like I was climbing a mountain!"

Celeste,Indie,504230,"Didn't really click for me until the last three chapters, but once I got into it I couldn't put it down.  Some really nice ideas and a really great puzzle platformer."
Celeste,Indie,504230,best platformer game if u love challenge play it
Celeste,Indie,504230,Very good platformer with a great underlying plot. The game has a well designed difficulty curve allowing almost anyone to be able to play this game without an immense learning curve. Overall highly recommend this game as it is very enjoyable and a good challenge.

Celeste,Indie,504230,I just beat the entire game with a guitar hero controller
Celeste,Indie,504230,My favourite game of all time. No more words needed.
Celeste,Indie,504230,"Ive only played this game for 7 hours but the visuals, story, and soundtrack alone were well worth it. Its an addicting yet challenging 2D platformer. Each area presents a fresh mix of mechanics to keep you interested. Have not played recently because I beat the main campaign and did not want to try for the super secret challenges (because I am bad). I still think those hours were well worth the ~15$ I would spend on the game."

Celeste,Indie,504230,"Beautiful game, Great Story and punishing Post Game. 10/10 would definitely recommend."

GRIS,Indie,683320,"This is a just-barely recommend from me. It's absolutely a piece of art, and while it didn't move me too much (I'm broken and old), I can see the themes are there and would definitely click with the right player. And of course the art and music are great.

The problem is the gameplay. It's not agonizing or terrible like a lot of games I've played, but it is annoying and commits a *lot* of cardinal game design sins. The biggest and most obvious is that the biggest challenge in the entire game is figuring out what's an obstacle/platform and what isn't. I had to google for puzzle help twice, and both times the answer was that I couldn't see a platform that was not even intended to be hidden. There's a whole section of the game (underwater) where the walls and places that aren't walls look literally identical (pure black). There's a screenshot showing this in the list (second to last one) - the only reason I know that pillar isn't solid is because there's open space behind it. You just have to infer from what's around whether it's an obstacle or not. That was my biggest gripe by far, but there are a lot of other smaller game design problems. 

Fundamentally though, you're here for the art and message, and the gameplay doesn't get very much in the way of that. It is never super taxing, and there isn't any way to fail, and the whole thing is quite short. I think it's pretty much where it should be on that spectrum. I would not have played it if it were longer, but I don't regret playing it as is."
GRIS,Indie,683320,"Gris is a very emotional and a heart touching game, It will teach the player as how to deal with grief (or depression) and face it with heads held high. The game forces the player to traverse pain and reach the light (overcome grief) at the end. The colors in this game represent a narrative device which will slowly be revealing the plot as the player progresses through the game.  A masterpiece of a game and highly recommended.

GRIS,Indie,683320,"The music in this game is amazing, as well as the art style. In fact, I wouldn't have brought the game without listening to the soundtrack.

However, the gameplay experience is, I would say, boring. The puzzle is not that hard but you lose your sense of direction easily and don't know what to do especially in the second half of the game. There's not much plot to it and I lost my patience to explore and just wanted to finish the game.

Edit: I've just watched an analysis of Gris on YouTube. It looks like I've miss the point. Might replay it in the future."
GRIS,Indie,683320,"Game starts a bit slow, but it picks up amazingly well. The art and sound direction is masterclass and this game is not to be missed.
If you like games like Monument Valley, then pick this up without thinking twice
"
GRIS,Indie,683320,"First let's get the cons out of the way:
1) The game is quite short. 3-5 hours on a first playthrough unless you either really struggle or are very good. I'd say 2 hours minimum.
2) There is no direct threat of failing although the game can become quite intense.
3) Jumping and puzzles are on the easy side except the optional stuff. This can of course be a good thing, there's not much of the risk that you won't see the ending.

Now the good stuff:
The game is a piece of art and in many ways should be treated at such. Both visuals and sound are absolutely stunning.
Controls are forgiving but responsive enough to feel good. You don't need pixel accuracy.
The game is very symbolic and emotional.
The playtime can be extended a bit more if you look for all the optional stuff. Probably quite a bit if you don't follow a guide."
GRIS,Indie,683320,"This game is slow paced. it is good for people like me. Its puzzles is very easy too. Youd odnt really need to think about different path in this game or hidden route or something like in mario or sonic. you just walk and its the right route. The ending is good too. Again, this game is kinda slow paced and im absolutely okay with that."
GRIS,Indie,683320,"Obviously the visuals and audio for this game are stunning but what i found was that, unlike what some other reviews said, this game is pretty intuitive, the mechanics just make sense and it's all very logical, u might get stuck if u don't notice something but if you look around for a bit longer you'll find your way around"
GRIS,Indie,683320,"This is a really unique experience; it does not feel like other games. You control someone grappling with emotional trauma, journeying through various environments that all exhibit the same minimalist aesthetic. The soundtrack is just as impressive as the visual art, usually contributing to the tranquility but also creating tension when it is needed. Although this is a video game, it would be a good short film as well. In spite of all this praise, I would not buy this game at full price: it took me a bit over 3 hours to finish the game and less than 7 hours overall to get every achievement. I would recommend playing through the game before looking up a Steam Guide for how to 100% it, as you can backtrack to each chapter's checkpoints once you are done to find everything you missed. Even then, try not to rush, since finding all the glowing circle things will give you access to a secret scene that fully explains the story and backtracking gets annoying. 

Not on sale? Maybe buy it, depending on how much you value like $10. On sale? Definitely buy it!"
GRIS,Indie,683320,"The graphics and music are 10/10. The puzzles overall are fun but sometimes its hard to tell whats a platform and whats part of the background, making some puzzles tedious and confusing. There were three times in which I was just walking around in circled just because I didnt see a small butterfly in a jar.

Besides that, the game is really enjoyable, the platforming is fun and it portrays a beautiful story that some may relate to.

Recommended."
GRIS,Indie,683320,"Português:
Gris é um jogo sobre uma moral, um conceito, Amar a si mesmo e focar nas coisas que você ama. Essas são as principais coisas que gris me ensinou. Apesar tudo pareça estar acabando, nunca desista, e pense que ""seus amigos sempre estarão ao seu lado""

English:
Gris is a game about a moral, a concept. Love yourself and focus on what you love. This is the things Gris taught me. Despite everything seems to be in the end, never give up, and think that ""your friends are always in your side""."
GRIS,Indie,683320,Really really love this game. This game is feels so strong and emotinal. When i feel sad and happy i suggest the game to myself. Thanks to everyone who contributed
GRIS,Indie,683320,alrighty
GRIS,Indie,683320,GRIS is a piece of ART not a game.
GRIS,Indie,683320,"I burst into tears at the end right when the choir started. Highly recommended, just stfu and take my money."
GRIS,Indie,683320,Truly a work of art
GRIS,Indie,683320,"Audiovisualmente orgásmico, con unas mecánicas interesantes para los sencillos controles que tiene. Lleno de emociones, metáforas y evolución de personaje. Un Celeste, pero más centrado en la trama que en la jugabilidad. 

imposible no cummear con este juego"
GRIS,Indie,683320,A fantastic piece of artwork
GRIS,Indie,683320,Was a very beautiful game but overall felt empty and was boring to complete it. It didn't feel as emotional as I expected it to be. Was a bit let down by the experience honestly.
GRIS,Indie,683320,Goosebump simulator
GRIS,Indie,683320,im still crying
GRIS,Indie,683320,I've thoroughly enjoyed this truly wonderful experience with unique mechanics and captivating visuals accompanied by excellent soundtrack that manages to draw you in beautifully.
GRIS,Indie,683320,Beautiful watercolor scenery
GRIS,Indie,683320,"4/5 stars, minus one because the end made my wife cry too hard

joke aside, its a beautiful game and an experience worth recommending! (playtime around 4 hours, probably 3 without my wife)"
GRIS,Indie,683320,This game wants to be beautiful and perfectly achieves this goal.
GRIS,Indie,683320,"Such a unique piece of art. Incredible story telling through the use of color and sound. I never thought I could adore a platformer style game so much, but I already kind of want to play it again (I just finished it yesterday).

10/10 will inspire you & make you cry."
GRIS,Indie,683320,"A beautiful and emotive game about a young woman going through a grieving process. The visuals are stunning, and it conveys an emotionally meaningful story without any words through the visuals, gameplay, and music. While it can be a bit boring in some places and took me a little while to get into it, I found the emotional impact deepened as I spent more time with the game.

Cons:

The criticisms ""boring"" and ""like a walking simulator"" are valid at times. While I imagine these parts of the game are in there for a storytelling reason, to convey a sense of journey or a sense of what the grieving process is like, there are several times where you aren't doing anything except walking. 

Pros:

-Gorgeous visuals
-Beautiful music
-Relaxing
-Emotionally powerful
-Cathartic"
GRIS,Indie,683320,"smooth graphic, best for chill UwU -3-"
GRIS,Indie,683320,Beautiful game. The ending gave me goosebumps and I was engaged throughout the whole game play.
GRIS,Indie,683320,"Pretty game, but absolutely boring gameplay. Skip it."
GRIS,Indie,683320,"I'm just stunned by the visuals, songs and the whole game"
GRIS,Indie,683320,"An extremely beautiful game about facing the fears inside you and overcoming them, becoming stronger as you do. 

The selling point is definitely its narrative, watercolour style, and emotionally charged soundtrack. Platforming games are my personal hell but I managed to get through the puzzles without much difficulty, so it's very accessible (though perfecting it is a different thing altogether).

Loved it so much, teared up a little at the end too. I don't know why I waited so long to play this."
GRIS,Indie,683320,scrap
GRIS,Indie,683320,This game is so good that i'm worried that it's getting over while i play and what an amazing job the art and sound design team has done....BRILLIANT
GRIS,Indie,683320,Pretentious shit. Repeatedly hoists control from player. Unskibbable scenes. Not very CVD friendly. Not a great platformer and not a great story.
GRIS,Indie,683320,Nice visuals but boring as all hell. Don't fall for it.
Later Alligator,Indie,966320,I love it to death. Highly recommend to ANYONE
Baba Is You,Indie,736260,"This rabbit hole goes really deep. Deeper than you think. The things this game does with its rules gets pretty darn crazy.

Most of the rules are self-explanatory, but some are not obvious in how they interact with you and other objects, which can make some puzzles frustrating and lead to ""What! That's how that works?!""

In general though, they're all very enjoyable and some make good use of misdirection. Getting past that one puzzle you were stuck on for days and being able to say that you figured it all out on your own is something that makes you feel vry smrt.

If you're prone to looking things up you might not get as much enjoyment out of this aspect of the game.
... because it's a puzzle game. The whole purpose of the game is the puzzles. Don't look up solutions. Brace yourself, improve and overcome."
Baba Is You,Indie,736260,"Game is Good

BaBa is Cute"
Baba Is You,Indie,736260,"Baba is you
Baba is win"
Baba Is You,Indie,736260,Very unique and clever puzzle game. Hard as heck though!
Baba Is You,Indie,736260,This game literally does make you wonder if your brain is even working anymore
Baba Is You,Indie,736260,"After 100%ing the game, I feel this game is really worth it. If you're able to, stay away from online solutions. Really challenge yourself. There exist spoiler free guides online that give hints(not answers) and can really help!
Overall, amazing game. Probably one of best, if not my favorite, puzzle games I've ever played."
Baba Is You,Indie,736260,The secret to beating this game is to not beat it and instead watch your math PHD friends play it and every once and a while you figure it out and they are so in the zone that they act like you just did some crazy smart sh*t and that's real nice
Baba Is You,Indie,736260,"very cool puzzle game

baba :D"
Baba Is You,Indie,736260,"I knew for a long time that I was stupid. 
This game removes any suspicion to the contrary.

Great game.

Baba Is You,Indie,736260,oh god it's so hard
Helltaker,Indie,1289310,"Yes. 
Good soundtrack, cute game mechanics, learning that you have a new fetish as you play; this game has it all."
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,accurate portrayal of real life Miami
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"When you play until 3:30 in the morning to get an A+ score on a level, then you know the game has you by the balls :)

This game is set in the 80s in Miami, and that is for me already a reason not to miss out on this one. Hotline Miami is a top-down pixelated game, containing a lot of gore and violence. The game is mysterious and has trippy flashing colors, neon lights, VHS rental stores, blinking lights, shaking cameras and text. There is a large selection of (melee) weapons which you can use to kill/slaughter your enemies. While swinging your golf stick, bat, knife, dart or katana, you make your ways through 20 levels. I loved it where half dead people were crawling over the floor, super funny! (I am not sure how this sounds to the reader.)
 
Make sure you empty your uzi, shotguns and machineguns on hundreds of enemies, who always react faster than light and with an accuracy of a sniper. Take note that every touch/bullet of an enemy means instant death. I was a bit wondered that one of the first achievements I got was 'Die 1000 times', since in most game I try not to die at all or as less as possible. In this game dying is part of the game. The game is extremely fast paced and will bolster your reactions. The pumped up music fits very well to this game and is a joy to listen to.

To master the game and to get all achievements will take serious effort. To get A+ grades on all levels is mostly very doable except for the level 'Hot and Heavy'. To get A+ there, I wanted a 20x combo so bad that at a certain moment I think I started to look like the characters in this game. I am proud to have the ""achievement whore"" in this game :D. Your second-last achievement will be: Get A Life. Now as an achievement whore I have my life back and can sleep before 3:30 at night again, thank you for that!    

If you like games that brutally punish you for the slightest mistake, play this game. The way points explode after every kill, or the fact that the music never stops when you die, leaves you no other option than to continue the game until you end up as an achievement whore like me."
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,I was buy this for music. I love this game!
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,i like hurting other people
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,Commit violence against russians.
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"Run in. Punch them down. Drill their face in. Repeat.

Good game."
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"Some idiots say that ""video games cause violence.""
this ain't true.
games like these are places where you can empty your anger and hate. unwanted feelings.
just like boxing and any kind of sport and martial art.
Video games don't make people be violent in real life,
it's the real life that makes me want to kill people in video games.
Be Smart; Play whatever the f*** u want; and of course... Play Hotline Miami 1&2."
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,really cool murder simulator XD
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"The first word that describes what is Hotline Miami either when completing the game or while playing is: Addictive.
With simple and fluid gameplay and high replay factor, Hotline is one of those short-stage games that makes you lose track of time and not want to stop playing. The challenge and reward in each new success make you repeat to yourself over and over again ""okay, just one more mission and I'll stop"" and you never stop.
The story manages to be simple and mysterious at the same time, you get calls and your mission is to kill people, just like that, without knowing why, who these people are, and what these animal masks mean, it's totally thought-provoking and grabs your attention from beginning to end.
The game mechanics are great, the controls are very responsive and the gameplay is on the verge of excellence, whenever you fail in a mission you identify where your mistake was and adapt to not commit it again. The pixel art is great, the vaporwave aesthetic fits perfectly with the time the game is set and the soundtrack is absurdly good... Very, very, very good, really... Listen to this even when you're not playing.
I really can't see any reason not to play Hotline Miami, this is a ""must play""."

Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"One of my favorite games. 
After completing the game, I can highly recommend it. Game is quite difficult, you need patience to complete it,  if you have no patience, don't buy this game and play candy crush instead. The game takes place in Miami in the late 80's. game is about a man who will kill everyone he sees. Plus music. Don't turn off the music in this game or you'll need help. After completing the game, you should play Hotline Miami 2"
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"This game is worth every penny. I literally mean it. Here is a quick review of the:
So Hotline Miami is a Trail 'n' Error videogame with a top-down view and a very 80's vibe. This game is FULL OF ACTION. And when i say full of action, i really mean full of action. Sometimes the game can be very frustrating but usually it's a fun way to pass time. I cannot talk about the story because i accidentaly skipped one part and now I do not understand anything lol. So I reviewed the story, and the gameplay what else? oh yeah- the music- ITS SO AWESOME OMG! Music is sooooo goooooooooood. Like I said it is worth every penny so buy it :) 8/10"

Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"Some most unnecessarily difficult bosses in any game ever made, but the rest of the game is a certified timeless masterpiece. One of the best soundtracks ever, a story that has emotional impact without being forced down your throat, and gameplay that's fast and exhilarating.

Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"After I finished the all game I can say my really opinion about the game.
This game is from a Roguelike genre and if you like this genre you will liked this game.
Anyone can like this game even if they have not played in this genre.
The game takes you straight to the plot and there are not so many things here that are hard to understand.
I liked how each character did in this game, they look crazy. You can improve them all to legendary characters and then they look better and stronger.
Also the items look good and The items also look good and have ranks like common, rare, unique and legendary. Like for characters.
The boss fights, Well I have no words because they look crazy and very difficult but fun.
In my opinion, this is the best game I have played so far.
GOOD GAME."
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,basiccly hades but you die more and also bonk
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"Good-ish game, but the enemies attacks leave me feeling like I've been cheated. I especially hate how the developer's version of difficulty is often able to boiled down to throw more enemies at you and make it so there's less you can actually do to the enemies around you. For example take the mini boss fights in the middle of each level. Each level you progress they just throw more minibosses at you until you are overwhelmed, or you get lucky enough to have a ridiculous build that can carry you to the final boss. The game becomes a battle of attrition until you die, or beat the final boss. The game leaves something to be desired, it's a novel idea and all, just lacks adequate execution. From a game where I would expect to be defeating heroes I would imagine I would be fighting small parties, but instead I have to fight hordes of worthless soldiers that sometimes get free hits on me. I would also expect to be incredibly tanky, but end up being able to die faster than I can in dead cells. On the other side of things, the art direction and style of the game are impeccable, and are something that keeps me from hating this game. The music often calms me down after a stressful run, and the tracks throughout are honestly good. Despite being mostly foreign (from what I know) the devs are hardworking and seem to be caring for their community, even if they are masochists like me for playing games like this. In conclusion the gameplay doesn't really feel all that skill based, but the game still looks and feels good for the most part (I'm looking at you, concentration mechanics)."
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"Skul: The Hero Slayer is a creative take on rougelikes, you play as a skeleton that slays heroes as the title makes obvious. Instead of having selectable characters you find skulls throughout your run. You can hold two of the at a time and you can switch between them they give you different abilities and attacks. Would highly recommend to rougelike fans or anyone looking for a good challenge."
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"If you like anything like Hades or Risk of Rain 2, you'll love this. 10/10 would recommend!"

"
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"This game reminds me of dead cells a lot, because of the constant starting back from beginning, though there are power ups and upgrades you can get, this game is difficult but very fun and rewarding would recommend to anyone who enjoys a challenge while having fun :]"

Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"Incredibly fun, easy to pick up and mechanics are simple. It can also be intense at times with nice boss battles paired with beautiful pixel art that helps with the theme and fantasy setting of the story."
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"This one is a really well done sidescrolling rouglite.
The main selling point here is the skull switching mechanic: you collect different skulls to transform into one of the numerous ""classes"", each with their unique abilities and mechanics.

There are some balancing issues between the skulls, but I think it's inevitable in this type of game. Some skulls are just bad and have no redeeming abilities, while others are so strong you don't really need to do anything except holding down the attack button (if you collected certain items, at least).

Other than that, it's a fun time killer. I thought it was repetitive at first and and it seemingly gets very difficult in the later areas, so I didn't really think I would finish this game. But I ended up finishing it just playing for a couple of hours when I have free time.

It can, indeed, get a bit repetetive, but only if you try to binge the game, replaying runs over and over again many times in a row.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this one if you like sidescrolling action-rpgs and rouglites."
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,打击感十足到位，元素众多搭配灵活，同时关卡设计紧凑。但是有些boss是真的很难，妥妥的硬核游戏。

Noita,RPG,881100,"This game is not easy, it does not hold your hand. It rewards knowledge of the game but doesn't teach you much. There are hundreds and hundreds of hours to be played that you'd never have a clue existed even after having ""beaten"" the game. You learn something new almost every time you die in some new crazy way. If you want to be powerful, look up how to build videos on how to build wands. If you want to know the secrets don't feel bad for looking them up, the odds of finding them are so insane that even knowing how to do it, it's still a rewarding journey. Highly recommended, one of my favorite games to play when playing alone, I have well over 1,000 hours, most of them are offline due to the fact that it makes janky custom modding easier without steam checking files."
Noita,RPG,881100,"When I first heard of Noita, I kinda dismissed it as a Terraria clone with some cool physics stuff. What I got when I looked under the cover was one of the deepest and endlessly replayable gaming experiences I've ever had.

Of course, the physics stuff is a big part of the Noita experience, but I guess I'd describe Noita more like an alchemical rpg with permadeath. I'm hesistant to call it a roguelike because I feel like that term is a bit reductive, and doesn't really sum up the gameplay loop of Noita in a satisfying way to me. Forgive the comparison but Noita has a darksouls-esque crypticness to it. You're thrown into a vast 2D open world with semi-procedural environments loaded with secrets. The obvious path is to go into the dungeon and keep going deeper until you reach the 'final boss', but there are so many secret objectives, secret locations, secret bosses and secret endings to be found if you go off the beaten path, which the game encourages you to do.

One of the biggest features that isn't publcized enough is this game has an incredibly deep wand and spell-crafting system. Every wand you pick up has different stats that determine how spells are cast, and how fast and regularly they are cast. In safe zones you have the ability to tinker with wands by removing and adding spells from the wand's slots, which all interact in a way that's almost reminiscent of coding more than crafting. This comes from the minds of Baba is You, and as you might expect you can create absolutely insane combinations of spells that can come out in an infinite number of ways. By the endgame you'll have a rapidfire wand that conjures rapidfire lightning bolts that jump from enemy to enemy and freeze them, or a wand that summons goats that launch nukes that home on enemies. It's really insane what's possible in this game, it makes every playthrough exciting and unique. The game encourages you to find ways to break it.

Something that is really emblematic of Noita's design is the fact that the game's saferooms you find the in dungeon typically close off when you leave them. But if you have certain spells, you can dig through the walls of the saferoom and make a tunnel to allow you to come back whenever you want. This isn't an exploit, because when you do the game punishes you by summoning a powerful messenger of the Gods to stop your exploits. It lets players control the way they want to play while presenting interesting risks to the potential rewards of breaking the typical flow of the game.

This is all just scratching the surface though. This game is deceptively massive, and I feel like I'm going to be playing it for a long time, and that's before even getting into the huge number of mods. What a fantastic game, unlike anything I've ever really played before.

Also btw there's a pseudo-Multiplayer mod that's really fun to play with friends. Check out 'Noita Together'."
Noita,RPG,881100,You'll die and shut the game in a fit of rage. 5 mins later you'll be back to the game.
Noita,RPG,881100,"Oh my god, this wand is so strong. 
I can't wait to kill myself with it."
Noita,RPG,881100,"The real difficulty spike was inside us all along.

Much like everything else that was inside us, it's somewhere over there now."
Noita,RPG,881100,This game is ruining my life.
Noita,RPG,881100,"It's the sort of a game where you get told how to move your character and that's it for tutorial
It's a rogue-like game, but where you can't upgrade different things in-between the runs like in Rogue Legacy, unlocking new classes or buffs, or new starting items like in Isaac. No, it's a game where you die - you lose everything. The only thing you've earnt is a bit more knowledge about the game.
It's a game where you walk up to an empty shrine where you're supposed to find a wand, think to yourself - ""Aw man, the heck? Some shrines spawn empty?""
And then outta nowhere a giant saw disc flies into you, butchering you for more than half of your hp
After what you learn that enemies may equip your weapons if they find them first.
It's the game where you find out that some enemies bleed lava instead of blood by dying to a corpse which suddenly started acting like a beautiful lava fountain, sprinking orange liquid of death and pain everywhere around it
It's the sort of a game where you learn that some enemies explode after, most likely, dying to them 'cause you didn't see them shoot stuff so you let them come too close.
It's the sort of a game where where you can spend over 50 hours in it, start a new game thinking that ""Well, damn, I spend so much time in this stuff, SURELY I won't die like a dumbass 'cause of a silly mistake"", forgetting that the dungeon might spawn one of the toughest flying monsters in-game on the first floor of the dungeon just because.
Or perphaps a shotgunner who'd die in 1 shot from your magic wand broke a polymorph potion while shooting at another enemy, transformed into a magical worm monster from the last stage of the game and spooked the hell out of you, literally.
And of course we can't forget about you simply walking into the dungeon and seeing ""YOU HAVE ANGERED THE GODS"", wondering what the HECK does that mean
And then getting slaughtered like a pig in a butcher house by a spooky flying skeleton with a magical shield which repels all your projectiles and who can spam slightly homing magical fireballs at the same time
'cause game spawned Worms and they decided to ignore the worm crystal and ruin the Holy Mountain.
It's a game where you spawn
And sometimes
Something already explodes in the mines underneath you
It's a game where you can complete a normal run in around 16 first hours of the game
Then remember that you can eat enemy's corpses
And decide - ""Bruh, screw that boss for almost killing me, I'll show it that I eat such creatures for breakfast LITERALLY, I AIN'T going into no final portals till I devour its whole corpse""
And then you learn that you can explode by overeating, ruin your best run so far, and fail to reach the final boss in the next 20+ hours
It's a game where you can get ""Victory"" achievement after spending 70+ hours in it, just like I did.
And yet ya'd be proud of it.
11/10, not enough deaths 'cause of shooting lightning into an enemy and hitting liquid that flew from above at that moment, making it explode in your own ass instead
The game is pretty fun and enjoyable, albeit it takes a bit of time to get into it and learn the mechanics.
However, once you get into it you can truly enjoy them due to various perk combinations or wand tinkering, letting you put the spells you yourself want to see onto the best wand you can find.
I, for one, truly enjoy the beauty of perks making dead enemies turn into friendly rats and mushroom kamikazes
Gives you a tiny-weenie bit of that necromancer feeling
Which is exploitable as well, since the creatures you summon this way can spawn more creatures if you kill them yourself before enemies get them.
Can't say that this game is without cons, however, which are pretty much what I've mentioned above for me - 
The game may decide that you are having too much of a blast and spawn almost unkillable enemies at the start due to weird algorythm.
Enemies may steal wands from shrines, and then you could just fail to find them 'cause they'd die somewhere near sand or lava and drop it into them
Or they may simply annihilate you 'cause, duh, you have a starting wand and they get some ultra Harry Potter stuff.
The game plays itself as well, especially with perks for more hatred between enemies, and sometimes it gets angry at YOU for not restarting the run after hearing some quakes, since worms can eat through terrain
And, the most important con of all for some people, perphaps
Even after reading the wiki and guides I still don't get what some things do.
Still, I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of random dungeon generation and explosions"
Noita,RPG,881100,"Don't get me wrong the game has a great concept and incredibly interesting mechanics. However I do not think that they in any way excuse the issues with the game. For starters it is horridly optimized, I understand that everything is simulated, but there have been and will be other games that simulate everything on the screen and they never seem to run as poorly as this. You will die to things completely out of your control, and it will happen constantly (don't you ""get good"" me I've already finished the main game). For a game that seems to pride itself on its exploration of secrets, environments, and spells it loves to go out of its way to punish you for tinkering and exploring. Such as no and I do mean no reliable way to heal. To heal RELIABLY (i know there are more ways then these) you need to rely on rng to give you either a seed with easy ingredients for Lively Concoction, or the right spells to create an infinite healing wand. I have 86 hours in this game at the time of writing and have never been able to make an infinite healing wand. Where other rougelite games will keep their rules so that you may learn from your mistakes for the next run. Noita will often break its own rules just to fuck with you, the simplest example being that some spells will act as static spells even when they are labeled as projectile spells."
Noita,RPG,881100,"Noita is cruel, but if you can look past that you'll experience a truly amazing game. For the short amount of time I've played Noita I've probably had around 10 mental breakdowns, but after each breakdown you learn more about the games' systems and the puzzles within it. Knowing that I have more things to look forward to and more unlocks within my next run adds a sense of excitement that's unbeatable. Along with all of the normal spells and other things to unlock during runs the game also serves as basically a puzzle game with EXTREMELY deep lore. Noita is Noita which means sometimes you'll get killed by things completely out of your control, but at the end of the day Noita is a super fun game."
Noita,RPG,881100,"The games roguelite aspect makes up only a smaller part of the whole game. There is a large amount of content in the form of secrets. Secrets in general are good, but Noita is particularly pretentious with it's secrets in that they are incredibly well hidden to the point where the vast majority of players will never know exist. The game tells you nothing, at all. And in the rare chance you stumble across one of these secrets you'll likely die instantly completely wasting your time. The actual base idea with spells and simulated particles is great, but I'd recommend another roguelite if you want to play a game that doesn't require a PHD in Noita lore and 10+ hours on a single run (where you can die instantly through no fault of your own any time)."
Noita,RPG,881100,fun but way too hard
Noita,RPG,881100,"Noita is one, if not the, most infuriating video games I have ever played. The secrets are so complex and convoluted as to need to google search all of the answers. I have spent my entire time playing so far just dying over and over and over again. 

But, I love the game. It doesn’t just tell you the answer, so you have to work hard to get anywhere. I celebrated even the smallest improvement, because it meant something. I can’t say I have gotten the level of satisfaction from dying in any other game. Dying normally means you have lost, but here it means you improved. I quite enjoy the pixel art style, and the overall aesthetic the game’s graphics give. It is the perfect mixture of the pain of failure and the joy of improvement. While this game is not for everyone, I would recommend it to anyone who will listen."
Noita,RPG,881100,maybe the real noita was the friends we made along the way
Noita,RPG,881100,"I don't understand a damn thing about what's going on. All I know is that I'm some wizard going through procedurally generated biomes on the hunt for spells, wands, all that fun shit, and everything is out to kill you. The world itself is out to kill you. Everything burns. Everything melts. Your spells are out to kill you. It's hard as shit, but it's fun."

Noita,RPG,881100,"This has been a good reminder that ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" review score will not ensure a favorable experience. Different things are for different people, and though I count myself as a huge fan of pretty much everything this game uses as inspiration; I am sorely disappointed by Noita.

Without putting in the time to double or triple my hours; it's hard to explain exactly what is wrong here, but there are a few points I feel are consistently negative on my gameplay experience that have overall driven me to drop Noita.

-Shuffle wands suck. The game is built around picking up wands, and applying spells to them to cause them to produce a useful effect. This can be very fun, but some wands have a stat that is enabled called ""Shuffle"". This causes the spells slotted into the wand to trigger in a random order. This regularly ruins that feel-good feeling of 'programming' your wands to do some interesting, and often-times smithing extremely effective weapons.

-Spell Saturation. Noita certainly takes the rogue-like/lite approach of creating an immense number of items, or spells. The problem here was clear in some of my earliest runs. The shops where you can acquire these spells have many options, and will hardly ever offer anything that will syngergize with any kind of 'build' you might have going.

-Painfully slow to get full rewards. As a minor spoiler, the game doubles the amount of gold (used for buying upgrades) when you kill enemies ""by accident"". You can create said accidents by killing enemies indirectly by burning/poisoning, crushing, drowning, etc... The problem with this is that its extremely boring. Ignite an enemy; wait for him to burn. Smother and enemy with liquid, wait for them to suffocate. You can obviously avoid this mechanic, but knowing you are missing out on doubled rewards on every kill feels bad.

I will likely play Noita a little more to see if anything clicks. But the problems listed above are more than enough to drive me away from recommending it specifically to anyone who feels that these issues may turn them away."

I've put in 40 hours at time of writing this and I still haven't come close to beating this in the simplest way.  I have no idea of how many hours I will play before I finally beat this game, but as in all things, its the journey and not the destination."
Noita,RPG,881100,"This game is the perfect mix of rage and dopamine release in one beautiful package. For a 2D Rogue-like platformer/shooter/spelunker you have complete freedom to abuse every physics, magic, and potion exploit that the engine allows you to...and subsequently your enemies can as well. While not initially realized on your first few runs into Noita, the whole gist is to go as far as you can into the cave system below you, make the most OP broke as fuck magical wands as you possibly can, and still die because you blow yourself up. Not even taking into account all the crazy secrets that I haven't even finished finding yet, if you like doing wizard shit this game is for you."

Noita,RPG,881100,amazing game!
Noita,RPG,881100,"Well this has quickly become my favourite (and most played) game. It's refreshing to find a game which in which the designers seemed to have foregone ""balance"". Sometimes (mostly as a new player but also as a more experienced player) you'll find yourself so horribly underpowered you'll wonder how it's possible to beat the 4th level. Sometimes you'll be so massively overpowered you'll think you're invincible. You're not. You'll die to something.

If you ever venture outside the 6 standard levels you'll find a whole world to explore, and probably wonder - how does this fit into the game I've been playing so far? You'll probably never find out yourself, but there's more to the game than you could ever imagine."

Noita,RPG,881100,if you enjoy masochism play this game
Noita,RPG,881100,"Noita is a very interesting game, but not purely for good reasons. This is a pixel-based rougelike with some unique mechanics, let's looks at the pros and cons.

[h1]The Pros[/h1]
[*] Everything in the game is destructible, and I mean quite literally [b]EVERYTHING[/b] can be destroyed.
[*] Requirements are low.
[*] Spells and effects can be combined to go from a basic shot spell to a cataclysmic hell-storm capable of obliterating everything unfortunate enough to in the way. Some spells and effects will work to your detriment though.
[*] Isn't time-consuming.

[h1]The Cons[/h1]
[*] Some runs can be borderline impossible to clear, like having an area's exit submerged in a lethal hazard such as lava which is near impossible to remove in large quantities. Not a fan of when a game is capable of intentionally ""softlocking"" itself by way of RNG.
[*] Does get repetitive after a few runs. Recommended to play in short bursts, not lengthy sessions.
[*] Doesn't have much in the way of music, it is very muted, for the most part you will almost exclusively only hear sound effects.

[h1]Overall Verdict[/h1]
Noita is a decent procedurally generated roguelike that seems to be intentionally made to put the player at a severe disadvantage at the start of every run. Definitely worth getting if you like a challenge, but I would suggest avoiding it if you get frustrated easily.

I give Noita a decent 6.5/10."
Noita,RPG,881100,WE NEED TWO PLAYERS!!!!!!!!
Noita,RPG,881100,lots of combos lots to learn cool game
Noita,RPG,881100,Died to myself!
Noita,RPG,881100,Its the kind of game where you can leave it for a week then come back and it will feel like you're playing it for the first time again.
Noita,RPG,881100,"One of the best games i have ever played. Im not going to lie to you, this game is very difficult and when you first start playing it can be frustrating knowing that you are dying early into the game and that you don't get any stronger between runs but once you get past that initial state and you start learning more and more about the mechanics of the game then you will fall in love with it. The physics and simulation of this game are amazing but the real star of this game is the wand building which allows you to create near unlimited amount of combos, think borderlands guns except that instead of the ""billions of guns"" just being minor stat changes they actually change the function of the wand/spell completely.
I would not recommend this game if you are prone to raging and easily give up but i would definitely recommend it to anybody who likes to play a single or couple of games for a very long time, if you think it looks interesting i would  recommend it as its very fun, challenging and the feeling of winning your first run is amazing.
however it is also the type of game that tells you nothing so i would strongly recommend that you read the basic and advanced wand building guide on the noita wiki whilst you are in a holy mountain so you can understand fully how the wand mechanics work, if you don't do this and don't know what spell wrapping is then you are unlikely to ever win a run.
some beginner tips i will share is:
[list]
    [*]you can fill up your flask with any liquid by equipping it in said liquid (even if its different to the one in your flask)
    [*]putting water in toxic sludge will turn it into water, also water in concentrated mana makes more mana
    [*]when mixing liquids, you only need a tiny amount. shoot the liquid to mix it together even more
    [*]concentrated mana will melt metal
    [*]health is your most important resource, dodge as many attacks as possible
    [*]cross the lava lake at your own peril
    [*] water is very important for washing of harmful stains and fire, bind your water flask to q for fast swapping
[/list]"

Gameplay is phenomenal and the randomization for levels is also great, every time you die and play again it always feels slightly different.

Highly recommend this game, pick it up and support these lovely devs."

The huge size of the world makes exploration exciting but also makes finding ways to travel quickly a must. 

Make sure you are ok with dying several times before getting past the beginning of the game. Also make sure you are ok with dying after investing several hours of game play in a single life. 

Would definitely recommend if you like a hard, challenging, and sometimes unfair game."

Noita,RPG,881100,An amazing game with some insane depth to it. Both in terms of mechanics and all the secrets there is to find. It would take a long time to experience everything.
Noita,RPG,881100,quite poggers
Noita,RPG,881100,At first it just feels like you're dying over and over again. Then you beat the first floor and see that you can edit your wands. Then you learn that the order of spells changes what they do. Then you're hooked.
Noita,RPG,881100,"I can certainly see the appeal of this game. The magic system is very fun, especially with the physics. You'll find yourself starting fires and knocking things over for fun. The exploration is also very deep, and the world is full to the brim with secrets.

But this is where the problems start to emerge. The game's a roguelike, and an unfair one at that. More often than not random area generation will spawn things in precarious positions, and while one run may give you good items through all of the areas, another might decide to give you bum RNG. 

I know I just described roguelikes in a nutshell, but what makes this bad in the case of Noita, is the size of the world, and the trek you need to make to get into the real game. You can't toy with the magic system or do much of anything until the rest stop of the second area unless you get very lucky, and you can't (normally) backtrack to edit wands you find or reach secrets in the overworld you needed a certain spell or perk to reach. 

This encourages you to comb every area thoroughly for the best items you can find, and this takes a lot of time. In most exploration games, time wouldn't be an issue, but in Noita death is always looming over you in the most unexpected of ways.

Death means restarting the journey and combing through biomes you've been through a thousand times before all over again, taking your time to enhance your odds of survivability, though it's just that, improving odds.

I should also note that while areas are mostly randomized, the locations of them, and the locations of secrets and special loot, are not, meaning you might find yourself repeating the same path over the course of multiple runs trying to uncover the same secret.

Simply put, roguelike gameplay is a questionable combination with long form exploration. If you want you can back up your save and have a ""god file"" for exploration, but that takes any form of risk out of the equation. That isn't to say there aren't people that will find this game fun. I do. Just be aware that this isn't a forgiving game, nor is exploration going to be easy."

OMORI,Indie,1150690,"OMORI is a psychological horror roleplaying game which should be experienced with little to no prior knowledge of its story. It tackles dark topics which include depression, anxiety, and suicide, as per warnings. As such, this review will be avoiding anything that would be deemed too much of a spoiler past the first hour of the game, but I would highly recommend playing the game yourself first.

What OMORI does extremely well with its storytelling is the gradual buildup from the foundation up. You know that the game is a psychological horror with topics like depression, anxiety, and suicide, but you have no idea how and when they fit into the story. While everything may seem cheerful and upbeat in the beginning, you will slowly be shown pieces of the other side, which recurs throughout the game. This leaves a lot of mystery in the beginning, allowing room for speculation on what is happening around you. However, a clearer picture does form quite literally the further you get into the game, and leads to a great climactic ending that pays off all the buildup.

As a story that heavily revolves around the characters present in the game, OMORI does an amazing job at having a cast of characters that you can really care about and can also relate to. They all have their own unique personality albeit exaggerated, which fits in with the grand scheme of things. You will be able to see the character dynamic they have with one another, and how they change throughout the story given the situation. One big thing OMORI hits home on is if you can relate to the main character; through its portrayal of depression, anxiety, and suicide, the game does a great job revolving around how those topics can have a lasting impact. That is not to say that you must have experienced those emotions before to love OMORI, but it can be extremely relatable to those who have.

The story and characters in OMORI are brought together by the visual and auditory charm the game exerts. All the soundtracks are bangers and fit their respective occurrences, ranging from relaxing exploration music to intense boss battle themes that go hard. They are definitely memorable, especially the ones at key moments throughout the game that will leave you thinking about them in the future. As for the artstyle, the pencil drawing the game uses has a unique charm to it that really fits with the story and characters in OMORI. It was always great to see it during combat and cutscenes.

OMORI’s combat is in the form of a turn-based RPG, which was a genre I was not the biggest fan of. That being said, I found the combat to be pretty enjoyable regardless as it had a decent amount of variety in what you could do with it. There are emotion states for your characters and enemies, which added a layer of strategy to plan for and play around. This is on top of the various skills and equipment you would unlock throughout the game, rewarding you for exploring the world. One thing that really kept my attention with the combat was the pencil artstyle; the characters and their varying expressions were always a joy to see, especially when they were at different emotional levels. The attacks you have were also great in that sense, like the headbutt’s animation.

If there was one thing to criticize about the game OMORI, it is the pacing issue it has. Oftentimes I found areas to be drawn out a bit too long, especially when trying to interact with everything in the game. It can feel nonsensical at times when it is not directly related to the main story, but I was personally fine with it as you were introduced to more side characters and soundtracks. This will become an issue though if you decide to run the game again for alternate endings and/or going for a full completion, as the combat starts getting old alongside the pacing issues.

I really enjoyed playing through OMORI, and it is a game I will be remembering for a long time. It has had quite the impact on me through the story it tells and also the message it ultimately delivers, and I have been thinking about it the past few days. This was a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the game, and it was a blast to experience the highs and lows with the main cast of characters. I would definitely recommend this game in a heartbeat."

OMORI,Indie,1150690,"A highly anticipated JRPG for multiple years in the making with lots of love and detail that is visible to see in the experience and joy you would have from playing this game. This is not Undertale with pacifist endings and whatnot but a story of a boy and his friends. 

I personally recommend this game."
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"a wonderful game, i've waited 6 years and nearly turned 18 by the time it released.
i've had a blast playing it, i spent months delaying finishing it because i didn't want to rush, but the ending was more emotional than i could have ever expected. i suggest playing it blind, on my first run i got the true ending with the secret cutscene at the end. once you've done a full run i totally recommend going to the other endings and route.

omori's endings are def well done, as they're able to make you feel the full weight of what you've done and how your choices led you to what ending you got. i also love how it also gives you enough room to think about your own ending when it comes to the true ending.

but one thing is clear, omori is a game about trauma,guilt,friendships,love and forgiveness.
omori is most certainly a game about how forgiveness isn't always easy. that forgiveness towards yourself is probably the most difficult and perhaps the hardest thing to do,how no matter if someone else forgives you or not all you can do is ask for it and accept what happens in hope of finding peace.

a game about how mistakes can turn a person's life around,how mistakes can burden you and warp your mind. a game about how sometimes, you have to face the truth if you want to find peace.
and most certainly, a game about how doing something bad does not make you a bad person and that no one can punish you more than you already punish yourself.


spoilers from this point onwards, be warned.

the true ending is a painful reminder that, even the best ending isn't the happiest in some stories. the way it cuts off right as you're about to cut off,and lets you think- would you forgive sunny and basil? would you forgive yourself? and after all the time you've spent with everyone, how would they react? the way guilt,fears,and trauma are tied in together so well, the plot twist wasn't what at all i might have expected,basil's role was also a surprise to me.

the fact also that you cannot avoid uncomfortable tasks like stabbing yourself,or can't run away from battles that make you uncomfortable are all ways to really allow us to connect with sunny/omori and relate to him, we've all been in uncomfortable positions that we couldn't escape from and had to face head on.

as someone with ptsd and trauma, a lot of what sunny experienced hit home which is also what made my experience so much more emotional. never have i played a game that had my emotionally invested the entire time while making me feel like i was in the protagonist's shoes.

i also have to add- the fact that the title screen changes during certain points is what i love, games that force you to come face to face with whats going on no matter what is really another way to drive home that you cant escape. 

the true ending with blue skies and sunny, the sunny bad ending where omori has sunny jump off the roof with nothing but blue skies if you open the game. the sunny ending where basil (possibly) kills himself (because if you fought him, he wounds sunny's eye with a gardening tool which can be seen on his fight sprite, he was probably gonna use it on himself.) and you walk out with SOMETHING ('guilt of mari's death') following you causing omori to reappear on the title screen. being in black space causing the white background to turn black and red.. it's all a reminder of the choices you made and the guilt he feels.



it was worth every day of waiting."

OMORI,Indie,1150690,"I adored experiencing this game. The combat was surprisingly fun and engaging despite me sucking at JRPG style games. The story was very touching and the music was so beautiful that I decided to buy the soundtrack before even finishing it. Some parts of the game dragged a bit, especially near the end of the game, though it's atmosphere overall was on point (the contrast between it's happy and terrifying moments meshed very well overall). I'll be thinking about this game for a while... Worth it if you like games that'll likely stick with you, if you open up yourself to it."
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"OMORI.




that's it, that's the review"
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"A white egret orchid. In the language of flowers, it symbolizes the phrase, “my thoughts will follow you into your dreams"".

A hidden gem, although at times slowed by uneven pacing, OMORI is a story about self-hatred, depression, and the dangers of hiding from the world.
Driven by a past tragedy, Sunny fabricates a wondrous, vibrant childlike world where his alter ego can still hang out and go on adventures with the idealized versions of the childhood friends he has not seen for the past few years. This Whitespace, innocent as it may seem, is still a product of his conscience and imagination, thus Sunny's sense of guilt inevitably starts leaking into it and haunting him. His alter ego, Omori, will chase after the truth behind this guilt, as to uncover it or snuff it out. 
The ramifications of his choices will echo in Sunny's real world, where he may or may not deal with his long lost friends, and his past tragedy, again.
It's not all dark though, with the themes of friendship, healing and sibling love shining brightly through the bleakness.
More on the bittersweet side is the relentless melancholia of the amazing, unforgettable experiences we had as children, looking at the world through our naive, magical, fleeting childish perspectives. Only through growing up we can finally appreciate these memories, and even though those times are gone, we still remain.

The game itself has a classic turn based combat system, based on three different emotions: Anger, Sadness and Happiness, each affecting different stats. Managing your party's and the enemy's emotion will usually be the main drive behind fights. Speaking of which, that's where the game's art is highlighted the most. Omori and his friends are depicted in -sublime- and expressive portraits, reacting to their emotions and to the fight.
This is accompanied by the manifold of different enemies, each with their own sprites and battle portraits.
The wonderful soundtrack often takes center stage, with moody nostalgic tunes, outright tearjerkers, and some absolute bangers in a few boss fights.

The content warning at the start is there for a reason, as you'll be transported to some very dark places throughout Sunny/Omori's journey. It is a story about the exploration of trauma after all! It does not use it for trauma's sake, through cheap shock value, but it carefully delves through it, making the darkest moments feel compelling and genuine.

I empathized with Sunny a lot. He's an expressionless kid, but a good listener who cares about his peers.
While (luckily) not being as much of a shut-in like him, I often felt as if I was made of black and white tones myself, a mute spectator in a world of brightly coloured people that couldn't possibly, or so I thought, understand me. Never feeling the inner spark that should have ignited that unknown something I did not have.
It did make me feel sad at times, reminding me that my own passiveness had precluded me from quite a few things, but it also made me smile. You don't need to be the most exuberant one at the table to show, to the others or to yourself, that you care about your loved ones. There's also others, less extroverted ways, and there is nothing fundamentally flawed with you.
So, if you were/are one of the quiet kids, play this! you should be able to connect with Sunny more than you might think.



While it isn't a perfect game, the amount of love poured into this work is apparent for all to see, palpable in every detail, every interaction, every beautiful drawing.

TLDR a memorable story about guilt-isolation-healing, solid combat, exquisite artwork. buy it

Thanks OMOCAT made me cry/10

OMORI,Indie,1150690,"Incredible experience, especially since I went in blind. The characters are lovable, the soundtrack bangs, the story is INSANELY well paced, and overall it doesn't hold back with playing with your emotions. Very lengthy game too; by no means is this game short, especially for the price. 
The warning at the launch of the game regarding self-harm/suicide/depression/etc being present is there for a reason, though. Otherwise, would highly recommend."

This game is the most amazing game you'll experience. Despite taking years to release, it was well worth the wait. The game has fantastic art work, characters, music and is very charming and has plenty of side quests outside of the main story to keep you busy as well. The story is very interesting and the many twists and turns kept me invested throughout. Now onto the characters... the characters are also well fleshed out and interesting enough to keep me engaged with the already amazing plot. (Hero is best boi. Don't you lie). Overall I would rate this experience a solid 10 out of 10 would get traumatized again."

OMORI,Indie,1150690,"If you are interested in Omori for any reason - STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND PLAY THE GAME

Omori is a dark twist on old-school RPGs like the Mother (AKA Earthbound) series. The official story synopsis is as follows(find more info at omori-game.com):
Welcome to WHITE SPACE.
Your name is OMORI, and you've been living here for as long as you can remember.
Everything is bright white. There aren't any walls.
A black light bulb hangs from the ceiling… wherever that is.
The floor is always cold. You don't mind, though.
You have a blanket, a laptop, a cat, a sketchbook, and your tissue box.
You have everything you need.

Sometimes a white door presents itself to you. Enter, and you'll find yourself in a perfect world.
One filled with colorful characters, endless adventure... and most importantly, your friends.

It used to be that the door would only appear on certain days...
But now it's always there.

Somewhere in the back of your mind you have an inkling that things weren't always like this.
You weren't always living in WHITE SPACE.

The truth is...

Your story is already over. You just have to remember it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game will make you laugh. It will make you cry. It will make you scream. It will make you squirm. It will change your life.

If you have made it to the end of review, cool. Play Omori. It's well worth it."

And this game did not disappoint: not only is it a great contender in that genre, but it is also all around a masterpiece that I cannot recommend enough.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Spoiler-free review[/h1]

I have seen people compare OMORI to Undertale, and as someone who was crazy about the latter from summer 2016 to 2018, I can confidently say that these two games are NOT the same. While Undertale is a game about making friends (or not), OMORI is a game about colorful backgrounds, intricate enemies, and a magical adventure that are just a cover-up for the horrors of the protagonist's life.
While the beginning might have been a bit slow, I quickly fell in love with this game as the hours went by. Get ready for at least 20 hours of gameplay for the main route and probably an additional 20 or 30 for the alternate one.
OMORI is truly a game that one should play blind. If you haven't played it yet, then I encourage you to stop reading here. Its mix of enchanting worlds and dark themes is more than worth it.

[b]PROS[/b]
[list]
[*]Great characters, graphics, and music
[*]Rich story with more twists and turns than a rollercoaster
[*]A stark contrast between the two worlds featured in the game
[*]Background characters are more than just decoration most of the time
[*]Lots of fun little easter eggs and jokes
[*]Great bosses and gameplay mechanics
[*]Replayability value (because you're probably not going to see everything on your first playthrough)
[/list]
[b]CONS[/b]
[list]
[*]A slow beginning that I wish I could skip
[*]Jumpscares; they didn't bother me at all, but I know a lot of people don't like them
[*]Minor violation of the principle of Chekhov's Gun with the character Ems
[*]And that's it. I tried to find other stuff I didn't like about this game, but I couldn't.

[h1]Long review of the game step by step (spoilers!)[/h1]

Here, I will talk about my experience with the game from beginning to end. You can jump to the end of it for the (spoiler-free) conclusion.

From beginning to end, OMORI kept subverting my expectations more and more. It all starts with some kids going on a picnic, with the only indication of something darker going on being OMORI's sketchbook. And as soon as BASIL's loose photo flashed on the screen, I knew I was in for an incredible experience.

The first two sequences did a great job at exposing the situation we're in: first, we have a sweet pastel world in which evil has seeped in and a very real, very tragic, and very dark real world. As for the characters introduced there: they all have a very distinct personality without being too complex. I really like the main characters.
Out of all the HEADSPACE areas, I think OTHERWORLD has to be my least favorite, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it. The fight with Pluto was fun, the JUNKYARD area was alright, and the battle against SPACE EX-BOYFRIEND did a good job at introducing us to the ""three stages of emotion"" mechanic without being too punishing (I'm looking at you, SWEETHEART). As for the characters introduced there: PLUTO is amazing, ROSA makes for a really appealing antagonist and CAPT. SPACEBOY was very entertaining as well.

On the other hand, SWEETHEART's castle had to be my favorite area: it was filled with jokes and running gags that I still laugh at to this day and ultimately culminated into one of the best bosses of this game. Even though I didn't lose to her on my first playthrough, I could see that SWEETHEART was a spike in difficulty with her immense speed, multiple-target attacks, and taunts that ruined my set-up more than once. She encapsulates the idea of the ""villain that you love to hate"": one of the best antagonists in my opinion.

Finally, the DEEP(ER) WELL was a close second in my ranking. After an emotional scene with MARI, the LAST RESORT was a change of atmosphere. After decimating the alligator population of HEADSPACE, I had my first and last game over during my first playthrough: against MR. JAWSUM, because I thought the game wanted me to lose. One of the most memorable fights for several reasons: the mechanic that forces you to kill every henchman before being able to attack him, the absolute banger that was his battle theme, and the follow-up battle against PLUTO (EXPANDED) that was equally as memorable.
HUMPHREY and the SLIME GIRLS were the highlights of this area for me. The former was my favorite dungeon, and I almost lost against the latter. Seeing SWEETHEART die was unexpected and completely changed the mood, making HUMPHREY a great final boss (yes, I know that SWEETHEART is alive in the alternate route, but it's strongly implied that HUMPHREY ate her before the battle against the SLIME GIRLS).

Now, it's time to talk FARAWAY TOWN, the place where the plot slowly unravels.

The town felt truly alive. Each NPC felt like they belonged, having their own side stories and little quirks. SUNNY and his friends were some of the most memorable characters I have ever seen: from SUNNY who forgot his actions, KEL who decided to drown his pain with friends and sports, AUBREY who went from sweet and strong little girl to violent delinquent, HERO who hides his pain behind his charming personality, and BASIL who kept living in fear. All of them learned to cope with MARI's death in their own realistic way, and slowly learning about how each of them is affected by this tragic event was upsetting (in a good way).

I did not expect what I would see in BLACK SPACE. It was an amazing representation of SUNNY's broken mind. BASIL dying over and over again put into perspective how far he was willing to go to forget that what he did happened.

And finally, the Truth. Words cannot describe the shock I experienced when I discovered it. It changed the simple case of a friend taking her own life to a boy accidentally killing his sister and never telling anyone about it. The way it was revealed was brilliant, and it remains as one of my favorite parts of the game, second only to the fight against OMORI. Tears fell during this fight. Seeing a boy trying to overcome his guilt was upsetting enough, and seeing him fail was the icing on the saddest cake ever that is OMORI's true story. And the Final Duet? Yeah, I cried. And so did you.
Both endings were great. Enough said.

I will conclude this section by skimming over about the extra content: ORANGE OASIS was very entertaining (""Holy cow"" remains one of my favorite jokes), and the alternate route was incredibly engaging, with the extra hard bosses and new BLACK SPACE rooms.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

OMORI stands as my favorite game of all time. With over 100 hours into as of the time I am writing this, it has pained me and made me laugh in a way no other video game has. I introduced it to two of my friends, who immediately fell in love with it as well.

And now, I am introducing this game to you, dear reader who came this far. If you haven't played it yet, please do so. It will be one of the best games you will ever play."

Minor annoyances: when dashing, accuracy is horrid. Save files can be too distant. Juice based attacks cost a lot of energy, an be difficult to win battles without an intense amount of food. never enough jam packets. After life jam is used, character is targeted and is down again.

Bastion,Indie,107100,"A game with impeccable storytelling, beautiful art, captivating music, unique weapons, exciting challenges and satisfying ending.

Even ten years later: a masterpiece."
Bastion,Indie,107100,"There are some games that play at the edges of your memories years after you have played them.  Games that, even when you may run across levels that feel excessively difficult, you want nothing more than to complete it and allow the melancholy-filled satisfaction to flow.  Bastion is a pleasing game visually, audibly, and story-wise, with game mechanics that are both challenging and easy to utilize.  There are some bumpy rides throughout but nothing that cannot be overcome with some time and focus.  There is a smoothness to the pacing that feels right—you go from fast action to a, well, bastion of peace where you recover and steady yourself for the next fight, uncovering and building up an existence for you and…others.  The story that unweaves is incredible, with voice talent so compelling that you can’t get the narrator’s voice out of your head.  And you won’t want to.

If you are not used to this kind of gameplay but are willing to try it, Bastion is a great introduction.  Pick up the soundtrack while you are at it—it is unique."

BattleBlock Theater®,Indie,238460,The narrator needs an oscar.
BattleBlock Theater®,Indie,238460,"This game saved my life.

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you Behemoth."

Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,This game is ridiculously good. I didn't even know you could DO what they did with the second boss. It only gets harder.
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"Simple to pick up, but very engaging.
Charming story and characters.
Pulls some shenanigans that kind of blew my mind.

Extremely good."
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"Don't judge a game by it's cover. 

It's the fun rhythm game so far I ever play :D

"
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"Simply put, Rhythm Doctor is an amazing game. Here’s why:

Rhythm Doctor is a rhythm game that seems very simple at first look, but is the complete opposite. This game absolutely astonished me, with every level having a different story and mechanic to it. The boss levels and night levels were amazing to me, and the characters and story have so much charm to them. The story mode levels were spectacular, and the distractions were so much fun to work through. The hard mode specifically, brings a really good challenge to the game, and makes it extremely satisfying when you S+ a song. The music is amazing, the gameplay is amazing, making this game one of my favourite rhythm games ever. There’s tons of creativity put into the base game, and lots more creativity in the community levels which you can make yourself, using the level editor. Either way, I 100% recommend buying this game."
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,Underrated rhythm game with pleasing art and enjoyable music
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,this game can be tuff at times but the music is banging!
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"pure awesomeness

the emphasize on rhythm is something to highlight about
and the visuals are stunning, though I hope the devs will add like ""REDUCED MOTION/FLASH"" mode

i really recommend it

1234567
get set go!"
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,clack
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,this game is fucking awesome
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"Awesome! The best music/rhythm game I've ever played! The animations, the music, are incredible! Beautiful story and genre. Anyone can play this just because of how easy it is to control and how calming it is. Can't wait for the developers to release more acts!"
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"Everything about this game is phenomenal! The music is spot on, the graphics are quirky cute and pleasing to the eyes. I have had a blast working my way through the levels, while none of them seemed too challenging to me (I am a drummer), the final boss did throw me for a loop and I had to try several times to get it. Overall, I have replayed it several times trying to best my scores. I can't wait to see what else they add to the game. Highly Recommended!"
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,This rhythm game is unlike any other game I have played. The amount of creativity with little cute stories is so well done. Literally the 2nd boss and how they decided to 'play' with you visually is enough for me to be blown away!
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,This game is hella dope. Big reccomend my only issue is that I wish there was a streamer mode. When I streamed the game sometimes the viewers were unable to see what was happening because I can only show one screen at a time.
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,Puff Piece is a jammer
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"This fills in the gap of (the lack of) Rhythm Heaven-like games overall, and it's not based on a complex set of skills to master - just an understanding of time signatures and rhythm will net you a pass on this game.
The soundtrack is also nice, and I tend to sing them from time to time when I'm bored."
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,Great simple gameplay with added difficulty that you can personally choose. Music is absolutely banging and the story line + visuals were much better than it has any right to be
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,good but hard game
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"me: sleep
my brain: 1234567"
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"You only have one job... push a button when it needs to.
And you WILL fail.
BUY IT!

PS: I am using the calibration everytime I play to check how sluggish I am before the game, and see it get imporved and get me more active after playing (and let me keep it that way till the rest of the day). I know its not used for that but with this, I can visibly see my sluggishness represented with numericals."
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"The current main content of this game sums to about 2 hours if you don't fail any of the stages (assuming that's possible, I didn't need to retry any), but don't let that convince you that it's not worth the price of admission already.

I've played a number of rhythm games through the years that don't manage to satisfyingly match up visuals with both the music and with the gameplay audio cues, but Rhythm Doctor absolutely nails that right out of the gate. The game's visual clues are clear and accurate, and explained with appropriately placed tutorials that are just as long as they need to be, and merge seamlessly with the narrative. Many different visuals will be thrown at you in an attempt to break your rhythm, but if your sense of rhythm is strong enough you'll be able to power through with the strength of the audio alone. At no point during the current main story content did I feel I missed a beat because I wasn't given enough information about where it should be.

On top of the stellar gameplay, there is a lovely cast of characters who move in and out of the admittedly short story, and they're mostly well realised, with most of the songs adding meaningfully to the stories and personal journeys throughout.

The combination of rock-solid gameplay, excellent music and touching narrative did actually move me to tears a couple of times! I'm going to have a lot of fun working through the more challenging alternative levels and I'm eagerly anticipating future updates.

If you're a fan of rhythm games this is an absolute no-brainer."
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,its pretty good
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,This is one of the best games I have ever played.

Katana ZERO,Indie,460950,The best cyberpunk action game featuring Keanu Reeves
Katana ZERO,Indie,460950,Cosplay taken way too far.
Katana ZERO,Indie,460950,"This is not a game. This is an experience. Story was shorter than I expected but it was extremely intriguing and well thought out. The pixel graphics are one of the best for its time. The music is by far the best part of the game. What can I say, killing armed men as a badass samurai while listening to synthwave is the best way to describe the game but it doesn't do it justice. Cannot wait for the DLC to come out. Highly recommended."
Katana ZERO,Indie,460950,"It's a tightly composed action game, but I found the core loop really wore on me as the game went. Not too far in, you've seen all of its tricks and the boss fights are relatively tedious--if you like boss fights that ask you to behave entirely differently from the rest of the game, you might not mind as they do vary up the challenge and I just said it was a bit repetitive right? Personally, I like the variety to be a little more spread out rather than dolloped into heaps of boss fight.

I also found the way slow-mo works a bit frustrating. There's, for me at least, an unintuitive delay between hitting the button and things slowing down. This allows for a neat little visual and auditory effect, but it also means that using slow motion felt unpleasant to me. The time it takes to actually be in full slow motion feels like an *eon* compared to the reaction time demanded by the game. This means I went through most fights not really using slow motion at all. I think I would have enjoyed using the slow motion more organically throughout a fight, but the delay made itfeel like a liability since it added one more complexity to calculating how fast you need to click or press to dodge a strike or deflect a bullet.

If this looks like your jam, it probably is. If you're on the fence, probably give it a skip. It's a bit more frustrating and a bit less unique than it looks."

Katana ZERO,Indie,460950,"An absolute masterpiece, 10/10."
Katana ZERO,Indie,460950,"Katana Zero is an overall engaging experience, and absolutely a spiritual successor to the Hotline Miami games - both for better and worse. I'd recommend it if you like Devolver games, even if it isn't perfect! 


[h1]The good:[/h1] Much like the HM games, your goal is to clear out rooms full of baddies with thumping music and intense combat. The gameplay itself is very clever hack-n-slash, it's snappy, satisfying and responsive. The moment to moment combat is for the most part very fun and exciting! The game constantly sets up new and interesting ways to beat levels, and makes you feel clever. It feels incredibly satisfying after you beat each area. The visual style is well executed and consistent, colorful and fits the theme. Again, much like HM, it has that (albeit trope-y) retro-80's flare, and an edgy story.


[h1]The bad:[/h1] This may be a bit nitpicky, but much like Hotline Miami 2, a lot of the annoying parts of that game are also present here, namely a far-too-heavy focus on story, and some questionable level design. Enemies can shoot you from across the map totally offscreen, and this gets annoying fast. Some boss battles are also just an exercise in pixel-perfect trial and error (don't even get me started on the lasers). The story is...kind of a mess, honestly its trying to be mysterious and edgy without actually saying anything, and feels like a bad Tarantino flick. I like that there's a narrative explanation for the protagonist's abilities, but the game dives off the deep-end always introducing new characters/plot threads, and constantly interrupting the fun bits with an unskippable, convoluted, messy story that ultimately leads nowhere. 


[h1]tl;dr[/h1]
If you liked either of the Hotline Miami games, or you just want something to kill a few hours with a pretty fun gameplay loop, this is for you. It's not a masterpiece in storytelling but it is probably worth your time!"
Katana ZERO,Indie,460950,This game is super short but has a great story and supporting characters.
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,The game Nintendo refused to give us
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,"This is an incredible RPG through and through. Everything from the certified banger of a collection of music, to the character design of the main party, enemies, and even NPC's. Same goes for the writing! Not only do the citizens of Bugaria feel fleshed out, but of the setting itself is full of interesting lore that you can learn about from the main story, but also from one of the collectables present in the game in the form of Lore Books. The gameplay is great with surprisingly deep and complex battle mechanics with things like medals that can dramatically change the flow of battle depending on what you use, witch adds a layer of replay-ability.

This is coming from someone who hasn't played a Paper Mario game ever btw. I've heard plenty about how great and nostalgic this game is for people who have played those older games, but as someone who hasn't played them and was simply drawn in by the Bug theme, it's incredible.

Please play this game if you can, it's an honest-to-god masterpiece of a game and it deserves way more praise than it's getting."
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,"TLDR: This game is basically ""how close can we get to Paper Mario without triggering a copyright notice""

After just having beat the game and doing post game mop up for the last 2 achievements I can write an honest review at 50 something hours put into over the last few weeks. 

The Good: This game is reminiscent of Paper Mario and you can tell the inspiration down to some parts, mechanics, etc that pretty much skin it and wear it like a mask. Like almost like someone took some chunks and replaced the sprites and names. That isnt bad per se, but you can tell the heavy inspiration. This game is basically ""how close can we get to paper mario without triggering a copyright notice"". Which is what it is, a spiritual sequel to the series. Some parts also borrow from final fantasy which is refreshing and keeps battles more tactical rather than spam hammer, etc. It keeps you on your toes late game or in hard battles. The writing is also very well done and the lore, etc is cute. Most plot points and ""twists"" you can see coming and I made it a game where I said ""oh let me see if im right, this person will do this and they will do this or reveal this, etc.."" and it did 90% of the time I saw it coming, especially for side quests for the characters. But I also am a published game developer with much experience in the writing and game design of games so I cant fault them for using common tropes and plot devices, character archs, etc. 

The Bad: There are 3 MAJOR stains on this masterpiece of a game which prevent me from calling it flawless. 

1: is the 2 forced stealth sections of the game, for a game built around battle this is a cheap way to pad game length and annoy someone with some metal gear style ""caught and put back the the start"". The clunky over world mechanics just made those 2 parts a slog and in a game of being a powerful team that can kill anything, feels like a cop out for wanting 2 chapters to go longer. skills need their own button mapping as late game there are multiple on the same button. 

2: is the bee, her character and dialogue is grating and 1 dimensional. She has barely any change and is still greedy and self motivated at the end, its not cute to see every other dialogue have ""hur dur we will do this FOR BERRIES or REWARD??, because im a greedy bee. we help people in need but I never evolve past being some 8 year olds version of a cool rogue character who doesnt need anyone but money"". Its exhausting to read and literally almost made me look up a mod to mute her when she spoke.  I know what they aimed for with her, but the character development was lost in execution. Anyone would have been better to swap her out for.

3: is the last 2 achievements. they literally lock one behind getting the high score on a CLONE OF FLAPPY BIRD. like its bad enough to have to backtrack to each zone 5 times to mop up collectibles but to literally have to beat flappy bird and some kind of original doom inspired bug game. Its just lazy, it felt like another way to pad game length. atleast have a method to bypass playing those to 100% it. 

In conclusion after this 10 minute typed rant, I do recommend this game highly. Despite its few flaws it still is a cute and cozy game that makes you think in some battles, has some good writing moments, emotional moments, as well as music and sound effects that remind you of the old days on the gamecube. I hope there is a sequel and maybe they see this review and address some of the flaws brought up."
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,"There isn't anything I can say that hasn't been said already. Just play it, it's good."
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,"If you're a fan of the first two Paper Mario games, or just RPGs in general, I can't recommend this game enough. Everything about it just oozes charm- the art style is adorable and characterful, the story is compelling, the main characters are all great, and the gameplay is an ideal distillation of timing-based RPG mechanics. My only complaint is that there's not more of it- this is a game just begging for a sequel!"
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,"This has brought back the wonder and sense of adventure that the original Paper Mario had for me when I was but a mere child, and with so much more. 

It takes its origins seriously, making sure that both homage and innovation peek at every corner, breaking my expectations and fueling my nostalgia. All these were feeling that I had not felt playing games in a while now, more so with games that take from older generations. 

Great timed combat, good strategies to personalize your approaches, cool abilities, and, for me as a translator, the fact that the game is in English, Japanese, Spanish and now Portuguese is outstanding.

Honeslty, I can't wait to the what's next for Bug Fables, and I have now means to appreciate its origins even more.

From the bottom of my heart, from a very tiny city in Mexico, muchísimas gracias, thank you very much, 本当にありがとうございます, muito obrigado！"
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,omg it's too cute
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,"Being huge fan of two first paper mario games, I think this is as close as you can get to those games. Everything makes me think of paper mario and TTYD, the world you're traveling, the puzzles you need to solve, the music, the combat, inviting partners to aid you in battles, items, badges, everything! 

This game is just astonishing in every way."
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,paper mario but in the universe where nintendo isn't held back by miyamoto's insane obsession with making good games worse for the sake of change
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,"Do you want Paper Mario 3?

Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,"This video game is full of ""bugs"" literally..."
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,"It's not just PM, it stands on its own as a great game. An interactive puzzle filled overworld, engaging battles, a billion hard modes, good characters, nothing really cliched, interesting plot and worldbuilding, fantastic music."
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,this game made it so I stopped losing my shit every time I see a bee IRL.
Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Indie,1082710,"A spiritual successor to the classical Paper Mario games, this improves on their formula drastically, while also having a much better plot and setting. After playing this, I don't know that I can go back to Paper Mario."

My Friend Pedro,Indie,557340,it let me have a friend epic game 10/10
My Friend Pedro,Indie,557340,I generally like to pay money for a game in a 1:1 ratio between the pounds and the hours. I'm not made of money and £1 per hour per person of entertainment seems fair to me but I'm not a developer so I could be wrong. This game was quirky and had some cool mechanics to show off and make you feel like a badass but then after four hours of that fun it just ended. I feel like this is the kind of game that needed mod support or something so they could utilise the mechanics in endless levels made by players with leaderboards or whatever. Thhis is not the case so the game ends up being four hours of fun and a kind of abrupt end. I can't recommend it because of that.
My Friend Pedro,Indie,557340,very fun and enticing game
My Friend Pedro,Indie,557340,"Matrix inspired Slow-motion action with parkour and martial arts and lots of guns. Goofy humor, simple story line that keeps you going."

The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"ESO is a fantastic MMO. The community is great, and the game is just stunning. I am an old WOW player from the vanilla days and I remember just going to hilltops or on top of buildings and being in aw of the graphics. I get that feeling again in ESO. Sometimes I just watch the sun set over the water while casting a line in the water. here are some bullet points of why i love ESO.

- use any weapon you want. You want to be a greatsword wielding mage with light armor pants but a heavy helm? ok. sure. you want to craft EVERYTHING? ok. You can get all the crafting lines!
-such a pretty game as I said above. A well put together world 
-quests are not boring like go and kill 20 murlocs. There is always a neat story of why you are doing things, and its never just go kill mobs of X monsters. I spent a while last night just pickpocketing people and running from the law to get into the thieves guild. then I killed some people for the assassins' guild. want to just read books? go to a bookshelf and open one up! 
-LORE. lots of lovely LORE
- mostly free. People that complain about expansions costing money don't know how the world works. You can play this game (besides the actual game cost) for free. there is no real need for paying the month script fees unless you want to get cosmetic items for your or your house. BUT that being said, its a great deal if you want to get levels faster, and you get some crowns thrown in for that sweet sweet flaming dog mount. But, you get a free horse that goes just as fast, so again, you don't have to spend money. 
- you can solo. I am a solo player mostly. I am old and not good at video games, but that's ok. Its not a hard game to play, and most content is solo-able. I will eventually try to join a guild, but I am a filthy casual. dungeon finders work well and I never think I am missing something. 
- adding that I love going from Keyboard and mouse to controller any time I want. I find myself using both depending on what I am doing and how relaxed of a play I want it to be. This game really is the Burger King of Games. Have it your way. Play whatever way you want."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,Im an adult who still struggling with life living in a rented place. In this game im still renting a place in an inn. immersive 1000/100
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"So, this is going to be a bit long but I'll try to break things up in to categories for those that even care to read.
[h1] Pros: [/h1] 
1) I paid $8 for the game on sale a while back. I've played almost 300 hours.
2) Said $8 buys you a fair number of zones to explore, all of which scale to your character level - go anywhere, do anything, right from the start.
3) The community is usually friendly and helpful. You meet the occasional troll, they become more common as you explore further from starting areas, but more or less people are willing to provide helpful information if you ask in zone chat which is more than can be said about several other MMO's I've played.

[h1] Cons [/h1] 
1) [b] Crafting: [/b]
   I've played almost 300 hours but have accomplished almost nothing in game. I can't even craft a suit of what is considered ENTRY level armor having reached max level. With research speed maxed out it still takes around 12 real world days to research one piece of gear enough to craft a set item, you can research three items at once (with max research) and there are nine slots to fill for an ""entry"" level build to start powering up towards ""end game"" content. This means roughly 36 real life days of time must pass (likely more, as research may finish while you sleep, etc) to make your own stuff.

You also can't craft, research, or disassemble jewelry unless you buy the Summerset Chapter, or pay for ESO+ which leads me to my next topic.

Oh, and if you instead want to try and buy gear (which is insanely expensive to those starting out) there is no centralized market or Auction House. Instead you have individual Guild Traders that will let you browse items posted by the members of that Guild. This can be anything in game that isn't Bound to your character or account. With hundreds of Traders, that can have pretty much any item under the sun, spread out across all the zones in the game you have to rely on third party websites and addons to search for items that may or may not still be present by the time you travel to whichever zone and town that Guild Trader is in. It turns what should be a three minute shopping trip in to a three hour struggle.

2) [b] Monetization: [/b]
    I'm all for folks getting paid for their work, however publishers tend to push that to the extremes for the sake of their share holders. Monetization in this game feels scummy, bordering on predatory. You want to increase the speed of your mount, how much your mount can help you carry, or how long it can run? Great! Wait 3,600 real life hours (150 days, if you don't miss a single minute of upgrade time, but more realistically 180 days) to reach max attributes or pay real world currency (RWC) for instant upgrades. 

You want to hold all those crafting ingredients so you can (attempt to) make things? Great! Pay for ESO+ so you have access to a crafting storage bag, or constantly be throwing things away as character bag space is limited to 60 slots to start, upgraded with a non-inconsequential amount of gold or (you guessed it!) RWC to 140 slots which sounds like a lot, but for Provisioning (making foods and drinks) alone there are 50 different ingredients. Say you buy the first six bag upgrades to save 2/3rd the gold cost, you'd still spend 2,000 Crowns (~$20 USD) PER CHARACTER to upgrade your bags the last two ranks.

The list goes on but the worst of all (in my opinion) Crown Crates - loot boxes which provide random items upon opening. To make it even more enjoyable those Crown Crate items can be scrapped in to an alternate currency, only obtainable (to my knowledge) by opening Crates, which are used for purchasing other items from the in-game store. Granted, I haven't delved too deeply in to that aspect of things as I do not have any desire to waste money on in-game gambling for pixels but to lock things behind a currency that requires you to gamble seems rapacious.

3) [b] Repetative: [/b]
   Yes, it's an MMO so it's mostly what you make of it however each of your characters has to go through the same Public Dungeons, Delves, Quests, and Zones. Delves, Dungeons and Zone exploration are essentially required to collect Sky Shards which award extra Skill Points (used to learn combat or crafting skills) outside of the Skill points you receive while leveling. You get 64 Skill Points in total by the time you reach level 50 (max character level) however crafting skills alone can require well over 100 Points (ignoring some of the traits I find less useful) meaning you will spend hours and hours grinding. But hey, once you collect all the Sky Shards from a zone you can use RWC to buy those same shard unlocks on an alt to save time. It'll only cost you $5 per zone you've already cleared and with a dozen or so major zones only $60 per character. Yay?

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]
All in all, for $8 it's not a bad game though it does feel like any old generic MMO with an Elder Scrolls skin stretched over top of it. I personally refuse to spend a single penny more on anything else related to this game even though ESO+ feels almost mandatory (+10% gold, XP gains, crafting progression and research, double bank storage space, the ability to actually customize your armor appearance, and more) if you want to actually play without dipping in to your bag every 5 minutes to make space. I am however going to leave this as a negative review as their monetization offends me to such a degree that an otherwise okay game can not be something I recommend to others wholeheartedly but you can't go wrong for $8.

The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,The sewers are full of smelly rat
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"TESO did not come up with anything radically new and actually just dusted off the familiar mechanics of the MMO genre. But it offers them in a greatly improved coat of an otherwise traditional concept and, of course, in the popular world of Tamriel. For some it may be little, for others a sufficient reason to pay monthly fees and have fun.

Jailbreaking and knowing that you have a higher goal is a big cliché in itself. What kind of chosen hero are you when you see dozens of similarly chosen people passing by? In previous The Elder Scrolls games, this model was accepted because it was a singleplayer game. But online with hundreds of thousands of players? And they are all chosen.

Tamriel and his states create the impression of pomp, but later you find out that a large area also suffers from inner emptiness. To some extent, this is due to a graphic concept that lacks the hallmark of originality. The world around is desperately monotonous over time. What bothered me the most was when I came to a town or settlement and found that it looked exactly like the previous one. However, I would expect some specific landmarks or architectural differences - in short, more interesting ideas.

The Elder Scrolls Online is an above-average game, but it expects a great deal of enthusiasm from man for the TES series, world and realities. The better you know Tamriel, the more you will enjoy it. Be sure to try the game, provided you don't normally play much online games or you're a big fan of The Elder Scrolls. I will definitely come back to TESO to see what the updates have done with the game. [b] 70% [/b]"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"This game is amazing.
World doesn't get old like in other MMORPG's, so questing and exploring is always relevant and rewarding. Endgame is challenging, but it comes without pressure to do it in a haste. Expansions expand the game, but without forcing players out of older zones and content. I'm having the most fun I had in a while. Subscription is optional, and there is so much gameplay freedom.
I wish I had started playing it sooner.

Give it a chance, first levels might be confusing but if you press through them you're gonna fall in love with the ESO journey."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Great game which I just came back to after some time off, unfortunately to discover they changed the privacy policy while I was away.

 Definitely not buying any DLCs or ESO plus, as you can get the extra money by selling my personal info instead.

Sells your personal info to anyone with the cash, including: ""username, name, demographics and other characteristics or descriptions, email, address, telephone number, and other contact information, account credentials, communications preferences, billing and payment information"".

 Change the privacy policy if you want a positive review, and also give me some compensation for this breach of trust (not a refund, actual COMPENSATION for copy and pasting my personal details all over the internet). Pretty annoyed that I paid for this, for you to later decide it wasn't enough and try to get that extra cash out of my personal details too."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"The blatant greed in this game is getting much worse. I'm fine with buying cosmetics, but they keep hiding them in loot boxes and consistently lowering drop rates, not to mention splitting cosmetic armor into pieces so you have to keep buying to get the whole set. Want to bank on the go? That's $50. Want to buy a house so you can put all those cosmetic items somewhere? $50 to $150 for anything worth buying. Not to mention the subscription of $180 a year without buying the $60 expansion. If you plan on playing for any decent amount of time, the subscription is definitely required, otherwise you lose half your bank space and the crafting bag which is infinite.

Look, love this game and the community, but ZOS is a terrible company who only wants your money. They don't listen to the community and keep jacking up the prices. I only hope Microsoft can fix the mess they've created"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"According to Bethesda, my own country doesn't even exist."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Loved the ending! Reading other reviews some folks complain about the monthly pass price though, largely senior citizens it seems. I stand with them, the pricing model is unfair. For that I have to leave a harsh but fair thumbs down."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"I keep losing my connection from the servers. If that wasn't bad enough, the launcher frequently becomes convinced that all the game's files have disappeared and need to be downloaded all over again, which can take hours. I'd estimate that a third of the time I've spent playing the Elder Scrolls Online has been downloading it over and over again. While the game is fun when it works properly, it's not worth putting up with all that."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"""Best permadeath ever encountered""
Via account ban.

So after 85 minutes of gameplay I had a single 2-level character in a starting zone with something like 20-26 coins and a bag full of loot, with no guild, no friends, no mail, no chat messages. Not a lot of progress, but hey -- I love to explore a game world, so I spent time crawling into every possible corner of a starting zone (and looting everything around, that's Elder Scrolls after all).
I decided that I like the game, purchaced another copy as a gift for my sister (so we can loot twice more!) and happily turned off my PC and went asleep.
Now, time for magic! I don't remember having a habit of sleepwalking (or sleepgaming). But according to the email I've received from TESO support next morning, they've caught me selling the gold during that night. I've requested them to provide any evidence (I am really into it, because I don't even know how to sell gold -- never thought of it), but received no response.
So... If you are planning for any long-term play, I can not recommend this game."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"i was starting to get into the game but now they decided to sell my private info? no thanks, i guess its time to quit."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"This shity launcher installer is taking forever, 90% of my game time is installing the game instead of playng"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"It's not that it's bad. I just don't recommend it. I am looking for an MMO that feels like an MMO and this just doesn't feel like it's it, not for me anyways. I can basically do everything alone, and I hardly see or feel the need to interact with others. 
I'm only 60 hours in, though. Which by an MMO isn't much. 

I just didn't have the fun with it that I was expecting, but that shouldn't deter you from trying. Especially at the base game's going price- It's worth a shot. 
"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"The game is decent, plenty of interesting dungeons and the combat is better than a few other MMOs i've played.

With that being said i just CAN'T reccomend this game from a collector's point of view. 
If you're expecting to collect plenty of mounts, weapons, minions ecc. you WILL be disappointed. 90% of the mounts are from the crown store, 90% of the pets are from the crown store. Of course, there are a few you can only get by playing, but simply put, they're all s**t compared to the paid ones, apart from a SINGLE mount that's decent looking, BUT, to get it you must do one of the hardest raids in the game! One. Decent. Mount.
Talking about raids, there ARE rewards for doing the end-game content, yes; what could it be? Mounts? Armor? Weapons? No no, you get some cosmetic that changes your character's skin texture. So if your character is fully armored (Like me) you might as well go f*** yourself.

The game has armor and styles, basically:
Armor is the stuff that gives you stats
Styles is what you use to make transmogs, basically consuming a style page unlocks that specific gear piece to be used for transmogs.
There are a few cool styles you can get from PVP, specifically the Xivkyn style. It's basically the Daedric armor from Skyrim, to give you an idea. To get these pages you must grind a lot, with the danger of an enemy player coming in to steal all your progress (You can only get the pages in a specific mode, but i won't be explaining it since it'd be too long), BUT, guess what?! You can just spend a few bucks and you'll get em instantly! Ain't that cool?
HELL, the only way to get a few good houses is to spend money! And i'm not talking about 20/30 bucks no, i'm talking about 90 f***ing dollars! For a digital house!

Do i have to say anything else?


Of course, you CAN get all of this for free if you have a Plus subscription, since you get a bit of crowns every month. Still, that doesn't change anything. Almost nothing in this game has any real value/rarity. I figured this after way too much time, so if you're a collector like me, don't make my mistake, play a better MMO."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"I was going to pick this back up, but the fact that they sell your information to third parties now means I'm gonna forgo that. I have other games I can spend my time and money on."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"its meh. dont know how to describe, but something about it lacks any soul. if you really want to play this, make sure you play with friends."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,Just buy Skyrim
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Buy to play, keep buying to keep playing."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"The game has some nice tie-ins with familiar characters from the single player series, but is best approached as fan fiction executed on an epic scale. If you can reconcile the game that way, you'll have a great time.

As an MMO it stands smack dab in the middle of your hardcores and your casuals. It's a game that can be played passively enough for people just looking to lose themselves in an immersive environment or actively enough for people really seeking to challenge themselves through achievement hunting or PvP.

With no shortage of accessible content, from questing to exploration, the solo-player experience is wonderfully executed. For the most part. Since the world is shared between yourself and multitudes of other 'Champions', the in-game player reference, it is often easy to run into other players completing your objectives for you and wholesale ruining a crucial story moment. The best example of this is mini-boss or boss fights being completed even a second after you load into the area. With no hits on the boss, you get no loot, and with no time for the game to set it up, you miss out on bits of story and unique NPC interactions.

The game world is vast and beautiful, with equal effort given toward recreating familiar areas from the single player series and creating new areas from TES lore. As is fairly standard for a modern game associated with the TES universe, the soundtrack is outstanding, filled with immediately recognizable pieces and just as well-crafted new ones. 

The main story segments (known as chapters) are generally well-executed, with side-stories being hit-or-miss. The challenge for newer and returning players, is figuring out exactly how to go about approaching the story as each major expansion exists as isolated narratives. This can get confusing when you run into characters that you shared 20+ hours of adventures with that have no idea at all who you are. It can get just as confusing when you're meeting a character for the first time and the game assumes you finished an earlier chapter that included them without you having actually done so.

As a product, it leans a bit on the predatory side when it comes to cosmetics, cash-store boons (looking at you $50 personal merchant) and loot boxes, but its $15 a month subscription service gives access to an infinite storage space for crafting materials (essential for inventory de-cluttering), a handful of crowns (one of the premium currencies) and any expansion content excluding the latest release. If you're looking for content alone, you'll find yourself with a heck of a deal.

A lot has been made of server reliability, but even with long weekly maintenance (5-8 hours downtime), it's easy enough to put in 30+ hours a week if you can find the time. The game has its warts like any other, but many of them are overstated by a vocal few who have been unlucky enough to experience them more often than the rest.

[b] The short version: If you dive in expecting a new TES experience that may or may not be connected to the grand story of the single player series, you'll find a beautiful game world with good-to-great storytelling, fantastic music and seemingly endless content to explore at your own pace. Not spending money on the cash-shop does not impact your gaming experience. Depending on your play style, not subscribing may become a hindrance as inventory space is at a premium for newer players.

The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,This game has an amazing amount of content. Almost 900 hours as of this review and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. One of the best MMO's out there

The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,the game got amazing in 2020. 100% worth the money now.
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"A complete time sink, but damn it keeps me coming back.  THIS IS NOT A ROLE PLAYING GAME, but this is a great MMO.  It's not role playing game because your character almost never has real options.  Basically, almost every quest assume that not only is your character good, but that you have a particular view of the situation which is the same as the developer.  If you are coming from other TES games, this can be a harsh contrast.  There is no true equivalent to the daedric quest lines from other TES games where your character does something complete beyond the pale like become a cannibal or murder an entire town, though daedra are present in many quests.  In general, the quest design is quite weak and boils down to collecting x objects, killing x enemies, or defending an ally while they do something.  There are quests which break this formula and those really stand out. The game truly shines in its dungeons and trials.  There is lots of cool enemy design and running random dungeons is fun and rewarding.  The biggest problem is excessive queue times as DPS, which is the role of the vast majority of players.   They need to do more to encourage players to spec as tanks instead of DPS.  The wait times as DPS are simply to long when compared with queue times in league, Overwatch, or really any other popular multiplayer game."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Dishonest marketing to their customers. When I pre-ordered Blackwood, it wasn't known to me that the game for a mere 20.00 dollars more would be fully playable in their collector's edition. I spent 20.00 something back in 2019 for a game I never ended up playing, so I had everything they were offering, then a few years passed, never played it, came back in 2021, pre-ordered Blackwood, then realized I bought an upgrade, not a collector's edition, which meant I would be missing two packs which I'd need to fully enjoy the game, and now they want me to fork over another 80.00 dollars for said packs from their crown store. No thanks. I quit!

These people sell collector's editions and upgrades. I mean who does that? They have their own terms and conditions in the realm of MMO gaming to the likes that I've never seen before and I've spent 20 years playing these games!

You idiots got 60.00 dollars out of me for a game I don't play now, because you've made me mad now. You scammed me out of 60 bucks for 200hrs of dungeon farming in an MMO and your game is buggy, even though it's been out for at least six years now, even in the old content--it's buggy!

Get it together folks.

I pre-ordered your latest pack and you gave me something I didn't even want! Besides, your latest attempt at a six year old MMO is full of bugs too, so what should one expect, and you want a house, be prepared to fork out another 100.00 dollars!

Dude, the prices here are higher than in Forza Horizon 4!

Oh, you don't have all the content, subscribe to ESO monthly for a mere 15.00 dollars a month, but listen closely, it doesn't include the latest two packs for the game!

I wouldn't have a problem with it, but you're literally giving the game to other people at a discount, and all I was trying to do was own all the content, so screw it, you made it impossible. Also, you want to do all the dungeons, fork out even more money for that too, it's not included with the packs, they have their own DLC for that too, and it's not what you think it's, it's a separate form of DLC on top of DLC."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Elder Scrolls Online has an incredible amount of content to do to keep MMO and Elder Scrolls fans occupied for hours. Originally, I played ESO on Xbox One in 2017. There I logged around 130 hours of game time and just barely scratched the surface of what the game had to offer (That might not happen for most people though as I was playing at an extremely leisurely pace). Anyways, I've re-bought this game on the release of its newest expansion, Blackwood. So far, I had a wonderful time questing, leveling up skills, and collecting resources in Tamriel and hope to reach the endgame unlike the last time I played in 2017.

Now, one of my only complaints about ESO is that there isn't an easy way to buy all the DLC. Through the Steam store, the most DLC you can buy would be in the $60 USD Blackwood edition. In it, you have the base game, Cyrodiil, Morrowind, Summerset, Elsweyr, Greymoor, and Blackwood. While those expansions will keep people occupied for a long time, if you want to receive the rest of the DLC zones and dungeons you'd have to buy at least $100 USD worth of crowns and individually buy the other expansions in the in-game Crown Store. In the Crown Store, none of the DLCs are bundled for a slight discount except ESO's first four DLC. As a result, it feels daunting trying to decide if it'd be worth spending the money to buy the other expansions since it'd cost a lot. Thankfully, people are able to trade millions of in-game gold to others who can purchase the expansions for you through Crown Store gifts. This is facilitated through Discord servers such as Tamriel Crown Exchange and World Crown Exchange where you can rely on brokers or reputable sellers for safe coin to crown trades. So, the DLC is technically earnable, but one would have to spend hours farming gold to get enough to trade for one of the DLCs.

Edit: Also, I dislike how to fully upgrade your mount it'll take 180 days or $100+ USD in crowns. This is per character (You can make 9 characters.) by the way and not account-wide. Having to slowly upgrade your mount on a fresh character is not fun since the extra carry capacity and speed from upgrades is a huge boon. Even if you're playing on one character at the moment, if you have any interest in trying another class/race you should make that character. This is so you can transfer gold to that character so they can start upgrading their mount while you play on your main character."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"ESO was a great game 3 months ago. I was really enjoying creating characters, levelling up, following the stories, etc. Even PVP was fun sometimes, specially when they removed the ridiculously powerful proc sets from use in the PVP war region (they're back now, as well as unbelievable lag).

However, in the past month and a half, ESO became ridiculous. Servers are shut down for hours almost every day and developers don't even care that some people pay for a MONTHLY subscription service to be able to access and play the game whenever they want. 

Ignoring the fact that ESO's dev team can't ever fix anything quickly and need to have more and more maintenance periods, the most disgusting thing is that Beteshda and Zos don't even have the shame to compensate ESO Plus subscribers for the time they can't access what they're paying for. I'm not talking about refunds, but if I pay for a month's playing time and I can't play for extended periods of times, it's only a question of elementary justice that the downtime is added to my playing period. 

Well, it would be, if they weren't greedy and inconsiderate to the people who keep this game viable.

Don't bother paying for ESO plus. You won't be able to play when you want. Just money out of the window. Regarding the rest, if you really like MMOs, wait for a sale where you can buy all expansions and the game for like 8 quid. It's not worth more than that now. 

A once great game, destroyed by greed and shamelessness."

I enjoy this game and believe if most people gave it a chance for things other than fan service and etc., they would probably enjoy it too. But what do I know XD"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"[h1]TLDR[/h1]

There's some very good Elder Scrolly stuff in here including some great stories. Sadly, the MMO format hinders rather than helps the game. It's still worth playing if you are a fan of The Elder Scrolls but know that this is a meeting that could have been an email.

[h1]The Ramble[/h1]

'I am dying. Let me give you the sword of my people that has been in my hands for longer than you have been alive.' - An important NPC.
*Your inventory is full*
'Hang on, let me manage my inventory a second... Hmm don't want to destroy any of this. Wait here while I teleport to town, sell, deconstruct, then come back. Uhhh, don't die while I'm gone.' - Me.

This is in a nutshell how a lot of the game feels. Arbitrary limitations because it's an online only game instead of a single player game. Players deck to the nines zooming at mach 3 with their Wild Hunt Rings of Sanic murder hobo'ing the entire dungeon while I, a novice adventure of a hundred and something hours feebly crawl, winded, on the first bend of a dungeon. Boss fights that are supposed to be the end cap on an otherwise interesting story ends in an anemic clink and clank before the boss falls down in two shots from the nearest rando.

There is good music in this game. I just have no idea where to point you to in order to find it. It is underused in key moments and a majority of it is background and atmospheric. That is not a complaint, rather an observation of the design choices made here. Do not expect Final Fantasy or hell even other games in The Elder Scrolls series where dramatic moments are marked by a rousing score. Here, silence echoes the clinky clanks of swords and axes and weak splishy splashes of magical shiny bits as the big bad boss fight ends leaving you go... wait, where's my fanfare?

Sound effects lack oomph and don't give enough feedback for any situation. A two-handed sword sounds like a fork and knife.

Graphically, the models look great. There's a lot of detail in the armor as most the body models are the same leaving to more focus on the art usable for all races. The faces look distinct and the helmets are the MvP with many racially unique looking hats and head-a-ma-bobs. Spell effects range from weak to alright (lightning looks cool, fire not so much).

Animations are terribad. It looks as if there's two frames and they just sped it up over and over. Except the mounts, they look pretty good.

Voice acting is mostly good with some questionable quality differences between some key characters. In the same scene the quality could range from 'wow, this is like SWTOR' to 'oh wait, that's totally Elder Scrolls Skyrim-in-the-knee levels delivery'.

Writing is hit or miss. There are some great stories in there but much like WoW, there's a lot of poop to scoop through. It's just poop of a different flavor.

Level design is pretty much every dungeon being squigglies of forking paths that lead to the same place until you get to the last room with a boss, kill it, then there's a one way door/drop back to entrance. Overworld design is 'let's place a distraction everyone 5-10 seconds' and copy pasta that through a map. It's really, REALLY effective carrot-on-stick design. My hundreds of hours were mostly spent chasing these pantsing squirrels. This is not to say the maps are not well designed, they are atmospheric as all bananas, it's just a shame the gameplay loop encourages me to run as fast as I can through these places. The smoke and mirrors are mere jangly keys and aren't well done enough to keep a player exploring the lovingly created character that is the map itself. The focus is on getting through to the story and the map acts much like the music, as a background noise rather than main attraction.

Enemies and difficulty balance is pants. There's a reason for this (I'll get into in a second), but it could've still been done better. Outside of dungeons and -some- world bosses, enemies are an annoyance rather than a challenge. They're so easy, fighting them is boring, but they all have annoying knee cap moves that slow the player down for a few seconds and can knock a new player off their horse so fighting them becomes a chore. The game encourages running from point A to B to see the story as the fighting is not the best and the difficulty is trivial through most the story stuff.

Quick side rant. Leveling up your riding skill is on a timer, researching crafting, timer, dailies, weeklies, log in rewards, all of these things drag down the game in order to fit the 'MMO' genre. It. Feels. Bad. The great parts of an MMO? Playing with other people. But the story stuff is so easy, it's boring in a group. Oh but the dungeons would be the place to group! And there -is- story to experience there, but only if you are in a guild or with ALL friends because some coconut-on-a-stick is going to zoom their way through the dungeon while you're still trying to read/listen to the story. *pause ranting*

Back to the point on balance, ESO has changed a lot since launch. It's now restructured in a way that any content can be experienced in any order (well, you can START any quest chain in any order, not jump in the middle of one). As such, the content is scaled to the player's level. This means if you do things bass ackwards, lore-wise more powerful enemies can feel weaker than a skeever. The great part about this is, it feels like an open world adventure where players can choose to take a bite out of whatever content interests them the most. The bad parts, a player can be confused why something they very obviously stabbed moments ago is now talking to them as if they're meeting for the first time because the player decide to bass that ackward. Also the difficulty thing. Oh and that you could have 99 NPCs surrounding you screaming 'I've been looking for you adventurer!' because each one is trying to lead you into a different story thread. Oh but you can only have 25 active quests in your log. SIDE RANT!

Management in this game, because it's an MMO AGAIN is pants on a panda. Inventory is constantly overfilling due to the system being created heavily to encourage purchasing certain things and money sinking. Hey, here's a daily reward, it's a crown scroll of poop on your inventory because it's a new item that you have a limited quantity of and rarely get so more than likely you either pop it and waste it or save it for that one time you're totally gonna use it on a boss fight so now it sits in your inventory staring at you taking up precious space for poopy loot. Let's have you swarmed by NPCs and side quests, and mini quests, BUT only allow a space of 25 rather than just letting the player pick up all the quests and ACTIVELY tracking a small list. BECAUSE MMO! *flips chair*

[h1]End of suffering[/h1]

In short, there's good stuff in here. I'll still play the crap out of my remaining time of the subscription (which grants access to all the DLC's outside of the Expansions) but won't be going any further most likely. I really, REALLY wish this was a single player game OR an MMO. Not a single player game in an MMO trenchcoat piloted by the most undecisive racoon ever."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,yay
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,Game devs would rather apparently protect grifers than the ones actually trying to enjoy the game. wish I could get my money back.
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,Definitely one of the best MMORPG games I've ever played!
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,46 hours in and i still have a lot to learn in this game but it has been MAGICALLLLL
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"My first MMO, lots to learn, but realizing there is no one way to play it and to enjoy the journey and not grind makes this game exceptional. Love the different races and classes. But what keeps me coming back are my fellow guild mates and almost daily guild events. Amazing social aspect and story."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,AYAYA
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,Good mmo.
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,i can be sneaky cool cat
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Great game , if you like to journey in a awesome RPG Open world game with good class designs and fun CO OP dungeons this game is yours , i have not finished the late game content yet but still love to play this with my friends"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"if you like any elder scrolls game you have to pick this up at any price. there is so much to do and they always add more content (even if it is another 60$ it still worth and gives you so much to do) you'll never be bored while playing. 10/10 the only problem i have with the game is the prices of the dlcs and the prices in the crown store, but if you have the money to spend then its def worth it, but if you don't just be wary that you wont have all the cool things like dark brotherhood and so on."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Everything about this game is amazing. The music, the world, the story, and even the combat."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,kappa
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,Played Skyrim decided to try Elder Scrolls Online  Absolutely No Regrets Reeeeeallly Enjoying it!!!
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Good MMO, has come a long way since launch."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"if you like the elder scrolls series then you will dig this. its fun, and incorporating online stuff like multiplayer dungeons into the elder scrolls setting is pretty sweet. if you ever wanted to play oblivion or skyrim with a bunch of other people, then here ya go."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Large and various enviroments.  Lot of various things to do in game, quests, dungeons trials. Lot of soloable things plus group, always something new to do."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Great game and great community. You can always count on great help in zone chat or you can say something dumb in zone chat and people will join in and it can always lead to great conversations. The game itself is so fun, there is so much to do. As a massive TES fan it's amazing to see these lands I have only read about in person. If I am bored (which is rare) I can chose to go on a fishing trip, scry for an artifact, go resource collecting and explore as well, or find a fun quest chain to help save a town from some threat. There is so much to do and I am excited for whatever is to come."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"This is easily one of my favorite MMO's. The lore is rich, character and equipment customization is plentiful, exploration is vast and immersive with breathtaking scenery and landscapes. This game is a beautiful work of art. I can easily play this game and lose track of hours. I am a big fan of the Elder Scrolls series and it was a dream come true to have this game created. 

There are two things I would love to see, though I doubt it will get any attention but here goes nothing.  The first thing this fan of elder scrolls would like to see is the introduction of a playable Snake Race like the Lamia race, humanoid upper body and serpentine lower body. When I first saw the Lamia race, i was immensely fascinated because the Naga serpent in folklores are my absolute favorite creatures. It would be the best thing ever to be able to play as one of them in Elder Scrolls. Please please consider it for a big fan.

Lastly, I would love to see the introduction of player interaction emotes such as hugging, kissing, riding mounts together etc. For players that enjoy roleplay and immersive experience with their friends or significant others, having these kinds of interactions available would deeply enrich social experience within the game. Being able to have that kind of bonding experience in this kind of expansive gameplay would be highly appreciated by those who also like to immerse themselves within the experience. Thank you again for this beautiful game."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Please read the privacy policy.  I was interested in coming back with Blackwood and saw the first review saying they will sell your information.

They aren't selling your PII.  That would be illegal."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Khajiit has wares, if you have coin."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"An MMO different from all the rest.
If you want to play in an immersive world, with an interesting story line, fun combat system, huge amounts of end game content and developers that throw updates and new content all the time. This is the game."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"A very immersive game, truly live up to the Elder Scrolls lore."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"nice game overall, new update should unlock more things give it a try"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"I'll be as brief as I can with this one cuze there's not much to say. Also [b] this might contain spoilers for those who care about that sort of thing [/b] : 

Pros:
-Decent storywriting and voice acting
-Tons of fun houses and accessories
-Endless skill customizing potential
-A huge world to run around in, even in the base game

Cons:
-Locking out certain pieces of the map behind DLC is stupid
-The grinding is insane, unless you want to spend actual money
-The digital Crowns conversion rate is terrible (normally)
-[spoiler] After the major storylines, there isn't alot to do until the next DLC comes out [/spoiler]

Final Thoughts: This game is definitely a step forward in the quality of the game, but there's clearly still some Bethesda weirdness in here. If you really want to get into this game, get it on sale.

Final Grade: C-"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"The graphics and atmosphere are pretty fresh and the skill trees/professions are fairly fleshed out. However, after forty hours of almost exclusively fetch-questing, it's hard for me to enjoy this game anymore. There is nearly no substance to the quest lines or activities besides ""Go to point A"" or ""Interact with X"" or ""Listen to Y"" and while I typically enjoy reading the lore in games, the reading requirement here is strait up overwhelming, especially to new players who are first familiarizing themselves with the worlds references.

At face value, this is a very playable MMORPG and can be fun with friends. But in the end, there just isn't enough there to distract me from the very shallow gameplay which is more of an 'explorative fetch-questing' sim, especially when compared to competing MMORPG's like Black Desert that offers a more dynamic combat system for PvP and questing as well as a more versatile Life Skill/Trade system.

The true nail in the coffin for me however is the fact that the developers thought it would be a good idea to splice up all of this games content into separate DLC requiring you to subscribe in order to avoid their in game microtransactions on top of needing to purchase certain ""chapters"" to receive further content. Seems pretty ridiculous to do considering your game is lacking in content as-is.

If you're a solo player, I wouldn't recommend it. However, anything is fun with friends."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,The time span that I played ESO was one of the happiest times in my life. This game is truly amazing.
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,grate game and one can play for free but membership is worth it.
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,Loved it
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,Loved Skyrim and Oblivion and now Love ESO
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,11/10
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"I was thinking to buy this game for like 2 years and finally i bought it last week. I never liked mmo games, cause I knew mmo means tons of brainless grind and other repetive stuff. 
I heard a lot about ESO that it is different than other mmos and it turned out be the truth. It is different in every way. I mean, there are still some typical mmo stuff in game like dungeons and other mmo bullshiet grind missions etc, but fun fact about this game is that you can literally play it like it is a single player game, which is awesome. You do not need to do this dumb repetive mmo stuff. This is the reason I am in love with this game. I'm playing it like it is a single player rpg game. Just doing story quests and exploring the world. I do not care about dungeons and other mmo dumb grind.

Area's storylines are really fun. I really enjoy them. :) They are really well written and they are not some fetch quest like ""bring me 5 potatos or 5 bananas"" bullshiet, plus all of them are fully voiced which is awesome.

This game has also really good soundtrack, I just feel so relaxed when I play this game. Music is fantastic.

Also I need to mention about community. They are really helpful, always trying to help. Even two players gave me 5k gold each to help me at the beginning. :) Now I'm doing it sometimes too. Trying to help If I can.

Also add some addons to the game. I'm only using 2 for now. Minimap and adblock to block this dumb guild spams on chat. :) Minimap is freaking awesome and very useful. There are tons of addons on esoui.com. Check it yourself.

Just buy it, my dear players, and enjoy the ride and do not be shy to ask for help on chat."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,its fun.
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,Better than wasting time on Warcraft
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"SOOOOO MUCH CONTENT. Almost too much to be able to focus on specific quest lines. However, the ability to install and utilize add-ons makes this MUCH easier to mitigate. 

11/7 Stars"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,possibly the best game i've ever played! very well thought
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"very good game yes, even better with friends yes! ._."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"If you're a fan of Elder Scrolls, RPGs with MMO-lite features, and lore/world building, then you won't regret playing this game.

Really beautiful MMO-lite. The cities actually feel like cities, and not little hubs. Every single zone has some kind of city or establishment that is so fleshed out and filled with named NPCs. The zones are gorgeous and flow together nicely as well.

I say MMO-lite because at it's heart, this game isn't an MMO. Yes, it does have group content such as dungeons, pvp, raiding and guilds, but the vast majority of the game can be played solo or with friends. There's no gear scores in this game either, and play styles are determined completely off the skills you choose and the gear sets you have equipped, all of which can be switched out and experimented with for a ton of character building. By far my favorite part.

If I had to share a complaint, it's that like most games today with an online shop, the prices can be pretty atrocious, and there are so many cool items such as polymorphs or mounts that can only be gained from the shop. If you sub, you get 1500 crowns a month which is cool, but to get some of the larger houses for example, you'd need to wait 5-6 months plus of saving those up just to buy the unfurnished models. Not game breaking by any means, but still sucks to have some of the cooler optional content behind a paywall.

Give it a shot, you won't regret it."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Aside from all the bugs in this game, it is really enjoyable."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,its a good time spender if you and a few friends want to play together. Lots of lore if you're into that sort of thing and crafting isnt bad
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,3rd platform I've owned this game on and I still get addicted.
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"This company should refund me my money. They sell all of your information to other companies! I paid for the full game and expansions and you still don't get all of the content, that's only $15 extra a month..
Customer support is so slow. They put everything inside of the Code of Conduct to allow for them to delete your account at any time without notice. You'd think you'd get a warning first but nah, straight kicked out. 
New users beware of naming your character. A short list that's not allowed are African, Hispanic, Indian, European, American, Boy, Girl, Female, Man, Woman etc!

I have a duty in life to not support weak sauce companies like these that are running it like Tyrants. Companies  like these should go away like the dodo bird imo for a better world period. You're either part of the problem or the solution and it's easy to see what this one is. 

They are total hypocrites"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,So this is one of those games that could have been fun could have been great.  However the devs made the mistake of FORCING PVE players to go into pvp areas.  The pvp is filled with trolls campers just in general annoying people.  The devs needed to get people to pvp because most pve players can't stand pvp the numbers of pvp players was to small because SHOCKER people don't like pvp!. So they add this lead you need to get for a chest item that drops in the pvp area trust me you wont get it because its just filled with A holes that you cant even damage because all they care about it pvp and want to rip open the pve players that are forced to go there for that item.  This game in my opinion shot itself in the head forcing pve players to go into pvp.
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"I heard great things about ESO and it has an incredible crafting system which I love. But know this;HUGE AMOUNT OF CONTENT  is LOCKED behind PAID DLCs. You bought the game? You have like 65 % of the game.You want to play as imperial race? NO you can't! You need pay for that... Necromancer class? No, no, no!Pay us please.You want to learn jewel crafting ?Noppppee... You need to buy Summerset content. Be warned, depending on where you are from and what kind of value your currency has, you may need a ton of money to completely unlock the game.And the worst part is that all of that stuff is in your face.You download it, you see it and at every opportunity that game will tell you that you don't own a content and you need to purchase it."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Combat is okay at best. Other than that, its a pretty good MMO which differentiates itself from the rest of the genre."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,Dream game
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"This game has so many things to do, the story lines and quests are amazing, the dungeons are beautifully designed, the character creations are endless. I would 100% recommend this game!!!"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,here is a comment that meets the requirements of length. play game. good game. game good. ok.
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"love it so much better then WoW, better graphics, game play, and character development."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Community is polite, you can duel other players like in WoW, seems to be a wide variety of quests along with content like crafting. PVP is an option but more to higher level players. You can steal stuff from NPC's. Its pretty much just like the single player Elder Scrolls but the world is much bigger, separated by provinces. The game is well worth atleast looking into. I ran into a level 1000+ player who helped me out with gear and showed me the ropes a little, showed me his house. Community is active it seems, developers also consistently releasing content."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,This is my all time favorite MMORPG
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"This game could be good, if only:

* Had a moderation team that did not target non G-rated content
* Allow for age-locked rooms, to prevent children from joining and to allow adults to be adults
* Allow for password-protected rooms to play with your friends

The number of times I've seen moderators ban people for next to nothing is likely going to prevent this game from actually becoming successful. It's unfortunate because the formula they have is actually pretty good.

UPDATE: Shortly after the posting of this review, I found myself IP-banned from the game. Cannot even access their website. The VRChat video of the banning also was ""banned"" from their community page. 

TLDR of the video: Someone else's actions resulted in a mass-banning of the entire world. This is not the way to generate a fanbase."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,now I can finally be anime
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,why be with your waifu when you can BE YOUR WAIFU ????
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"developers ban normal users for having fun, while their friends get to virtually molest and curse at you while being on a whitelist that prevents you from blocking them...

steer clear of this, alternatives like altspacevr exist and are much better"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"I am having a VR setup since December and I have seen A LOT, that includes a ton of games, ""experiences"", demos. And also a bunch of social VR apps, incl. Altxxxxx, HiFi and some others. This one I have to say blows ALL these experiences out of the water - by miles!

Let me see. Today, this Friday night...I have been in a giant show which was excellently done with anime dancers. I climbed about a mile up in the sky with some people and then we dropped down. I have been in some sort of anime/game forest. I have been in a bowling alley which appeared very real, complete with 50s music and disco light :) I have been in a bar with about 20 people and a bar tender busy running around and serving drinks. I have been in an abandoned prison with scary ghosts, traps and all kinds of stuff. We have played games like CTF and we've been in an old Western town where we were the Sherrifs and shot some bad Bandit dudes :)

A lot of fun also with people showing off their insanely creative avatars. I took my headset off later on and realized that I ""experienced"" more things in one single night than a normal person could ever experience in ""real life"" in a night, uh..a week or a month even. This is just frickin' awesome beyond words.

From a technical point of view, the avatars are excellent and VRchat even allows making and importing your own from Unity. Lip sync, eye tracking and all. Some of the best avatars I have ever seen. The entire system seems polished and runs smooth.

VRChat must have hundreds of ""worlds"" including games etc. to choose from since you can browse them for an half an hour and still didn't see them all. This is crazy. Uh, that being said people can also design their own worlds and games and put them in there. Possibilites: Endless. MIND. BLOWN.

And the people are ALL extremely friendly and supportive etc.

This is VR as good as it can get with TONS of fun and infinite things to do. Seriously it's mind-blowingly good.
"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Pretty amazing game already i see frendly and nice people :D keep the keep going with the game ^^
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"so  i thought it was pretty great. Talked with some great people. Until one day the ""host"" decided to get mad at me because someone in the room was speaking arabic so he banned me???? dont really know what that is about but whatever  I only recommend this game if you are willing to bow down to whoever is the current host or be banned. Im personally not one for putting up with some guy getting off to having a sense of authority."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"This was a blast. It's fun visiting all of the cool places with people. The only thing I would recommend for the devs is in the smooth locomotion mode to make it ""hand based"" orientation like Onward does it as opposed to ""head based"" turning. It makes me feel a bit off when I turn my head while moving forward and my direction changes. If dev is reading check out the difference in Arizona Sunshine's new locomotion update to see what I am talking about. I would also recommend slowing the forward locomotion down 20% or so."

VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Gameplay/review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKusRXHALCc

VR Chat is the best social game which I've played in virtual reality. I've played it for well over an hour and already had lots of fun. The people I've met have been very welcoming and friendly. So far I've only tried two minigames (discs and wild west) and both of them were well designed, bug free and simply fun to play.

I've played a few other social games (e.g. Rec Room, AltSpaceVR) but VR Chat exceeds both those games in my mind. It just seems as if there's a more established community here and overall everything just seems better (e.g. the games)."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"This is the best application for virtual reality, hands down. I have been a member of VRchat for over two years, and the community is what makes this place so special. Each ""room"" in VRchat is a direct upload of a scene in Unity (software used to create most VR experiences). This makes it very easy for community members to upload new rooms and content. The developers of VRchat are also making the games they have (Capture the Flag, Battle Discs, etc) available in the SDK. This means over the next few months anyone can adapt these games and create new versions of them!

VRchat is a great way to gain exposure to Unity/development...but you can also just have fun and talk to others here. Other social VR apps don't even compare in that feeling of community you get when you log in. Our meetups are on Sundays, but since its public release there have been people logged in continuously. 

Come join our community, and see for yourself what makes this such a special place!"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Best VR experience I have had, super easy to meet new friends who you can speak to and play games with for hours!

EDIT: Making custom avatars is super fun, if you are able to deal with the price of major depression trying to get them to work this game is made for you <3"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,The first game to really make me forget I was in my room. Stable and  fun games. Even without them the atmosphere is great.
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"The best of the social VR experiences around. Extremely customizable, lots of room for growth, and a very friendly community."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Alright my home dogs, I got say this game, This game is the game of all games it's without a doubt the best game in the universe, I say this having 2k hours in tabletop and I quit that to play this. Honestly you need to get in this game as fast and possible. The Devs treat you like a actual human, I say this meeting and personaly talking and hanging with them. I send nights just chilling with devs 1 on 1 or with others, There the best I have only meet VRPILL,Mechlaid,Kirito,Gunther, Somewhat Violet. There the best I got to say I'm telling you once you play this you won't ever need to play another game. Honestly I'm not plainning on playing anymore games or buying anyothers. Endless its series I play before that are coming out with new games cause memorys. I do have to say I'm only on desktop as of now, But even if I am I'm having loads of fun talking etc. A few things to note there updating the game constintly adding new things, Avatar Creation and World Creation very tricky and complcated I don't recommend you try to make one right away if you never dealt with, Unity,Belnder,Maya,Cinmea4D cause you will be very confused. Though there are videos online that can put your mind set in the right direction taking you someone step by step. But you could always ask staff,devs etc for help even people with avatars already, But keep in mind even if they have avatars they may or may not know hwo to help you. Its still pretty difficult to make one. But what really put this game on the top is its open source anything within the games rules is allowed I say ask the devs what your planning before doing so. The hub consintly being checked on , Also this is a E for everyone game so keep in mind its for kids also. So in the hub you got watch what your saying my first day in the game someone got banned for loads of not okay words to say if you get my drift. Scripting is not allowed yet but that will be soon there working on it as I write this all in all 100/100 as of now.Do you recommend this game? 100% Yes"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"So far i like this social VR platform the best, it has a lot of mechanics that i would like to see incorporated into future VR games, especially any that have multiplayer (especially MMO's, i can wish right?). But seeing a guy be an undead from world of warcraft just makes me want a VR MMO so much more :P"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,One of the greatest VR games I played!
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"had tons of fun so far, while it needs more things to do its a great start. def. recommend this to anybody that has a vive or is demo'ing one."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,pretty feckin good
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Best social vr game ive ever played.  10/10
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Some of the best fun I've had in a while. Supports desktop and VR so you can play whichever way. Lots of weird people to talk to and lots of places to go and games to play. So much fun.
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"next gen social mmo hub
seems like evolution of garrys mod cinema mod

Best thing is it also supports non VR players and not hardware demanding"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Fantastic
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Admin is a pedo, beware parents. Dont let your kids play this excuse of a game."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"This felt like the Second Life of VR, and if that is a good or bad thing depends on where they take the software. When I say that, it feels like the developers made an engine that could be used across multiple applications, and VR chat at this time is a demo for other people to take the engine and create a specific application. 

Or in another way, it feels like the second iteration of AltVR. 

Now it is free, and it is interesting to try out.. so on that it gets a YES on recommend. 
That all said, it feels unpolished in the graphics, and the activities don't really grab me. After under an hour, I hopped back into the bright and happy world of Rec Room. 

That all said.. I am going to follow this, and see how it grows. Gonna say, my other impression is that it looks like somebody wanted to transcribe EverQuest into VR."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"This game is fun but it would be even better if the desktop mode was supported as much as vr mode. Yes i know this game is more twords the VR audience, but i saw the trailer for this game and i saw that it supports keyboard and mouse controlls and i instantly fell in love with the game. so in my oppinion, this game is like a 6/10"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Download it no questions asked! I was astounded when i opened this game was portaled in and greeted by devs and mods!  Really supportive and everything this is the future of gaming and wow just wow! Thanks for this experience now i really need a VR headset!
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"If youre in to random weirdos who try to hump your leg, this is for you!"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Really need the ability to select which Microphone the game uses for Input like any other VOIP software/game allows. Otherwise you're left hoping the game picks up the correct device (in my case it does not). 

VR Control leaves quite a lot to be desired. When I played EVE Valkyrie, it was amazingly simple and easy to adjust as you could hit a button to re-center / re-calibrate the forward-looking direction. VRChat seems to assume that the sensor is directly in front of you, with no way of re-calibrating or re-centering it, I did happen across what seemed to ""recenter"" the VR headset but when trying to walk forward, well... I personally know my left from my right, and my front from my back, but the game doesn't.

In addition, I checked the options and ""Gamepad"" is checked as though it is enabled, but is greyed out as though it is disabled, and unable to use a gamepad to play as shown in the store page/options.


All of that said, I would like to see the direction this game goes and would recommend it if some more basic functionality was corrected to allow users to handle things a bit better."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,One of the most creative and amazing VR experiences out there! It's a complete toss up of random and amazing adventures everytime I go in!
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Good social game with a great potential. In my case I played without VR and was a bit lagged, but with VR should be a greater experience."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Recommended in the highest.
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"The social VR games have always been my favorite, and this one is the best in my opinion.  The dev's are always on and incredibly helpful to anyone with questions.  If you've got a VR headset just grab it.  It's free and its fun."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"This is one of the most promising, brilliant, social apps out right now. It's as random as the internet and VR should be. It's got endless potential, has tons of random things to to and runs so bafflingly well I am shocked.

Someone wanted us to checkout his PT hallway world. There were like 60 people shoulder to shoulder and not a second of lag, or any framerate drops. I am baffled by it. The amount of customization they are offering and will offer in the future is crazy. It's free, everyone should be trying this out. Making stuff, turning it into the Second Life for VR we've been asking for for so long."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Best VR game out there! (Discaimer: you need vr to do certain stuff) I rate this game 10/10
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"A stunning display of humanity.
One of which I want to return to all the time.
I love this game, and I love (most) of the people in this game."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"about time it came out on steam ,i have been running around V.R chat since 2015 it has progressed so much in that time so many worlds to explore awesome multiplayer V.R arena battles that awesome V.R show gunters universe and the V.R community just keeps getting bigger it really kicks ass i use to love ALT SPACE V.R but it just does not compare in any form or way to how much more better V.R chat is i can't reccommend V.R chat enough its fun without vr but just amazing in vr 10/10 https://youtu.be/ow751zmsMrA i just updated my review here are more vids https://youtu.be/WD314dWmdwg  https://youtu.be/kNiC0XLUXj0 https://youtu.be/gUJkz2gXAzA enjoy"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Very cool game. love the design of the avatars and the environment is beautiful. Played CTF and had a blast!... Developers are extremely friendly and make you feel more than welcome into their game. i have alot more to explore with this game and excited to see the rest!
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"I just recently started playing around with this VR experience or collection of games, or interactive application, it is hard to define really, but it is awesome.  This is now my new go to application to show off just how cool VR can be.  Not only does the communication with other uses work almost flawlessly (if both have good headsets and a microphone) but the app itself is beautifullly constructed with multiple ""Worlds"" on can visit.  Some of these worlds offer pretty fun competive multiplayer games, like capture the flag or gold with either laser pistols or six shooters (depending on the game) other experiences are in sight and sound, like multiple movie theater spots (where you can use your Youtube to play the content you desire), presentations rooms, etc.  There is so much to explore and/or create it is awesome.  Just last night I visited a moon base, not only was it beautiful and peaceful, I was surprised to see I could leave the moonbase and walk around the moon, jump in simulated low gravity and explore!   The avatars are full body and you can choose from a number of pre-created forms as well as upload your own.  I was standing next to Wolverine (with claws and everything) yesterday.    Definite a must have for any VR user."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"I really like ""Games"" like this I feel like there is definitely a place for an App like this to go mainstream at some point in the future.  These VR social worlds make me excited for the future."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Looking good so far gents. Keep up the good work. Friendly Admins, smooth fluid for both desktop and VR great little social sim/game. Looking forward to more and bringing in some custom models."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"VRChat is a great social platform.
I reccomend getting a VR headset Pref VIVE and have a Quadcore Cpu with 8gb ram and At least a 2GB Video Card.
It Can Play with a controller Although not as Good As Vive.
You cand download the SDK to create your own avatar aswell as set up voice and facial Recognition.
It really is a great Social Platform and i recommend it too."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,2nd world.  Vr.
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"It can be played with or without a virtual reality headset and or motion controls. It allows you to create your own rooms or avatars with Unity, so there is a lot to see.  And there is a few games you can play with others or watch videos (mainly youtube). So it is a chatroom for the virtual reality age. Unfortunatly at the moment there is no way to text chat if you need that."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Nothing to do and the owner/operator bans people that use voice chat.
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Remove the memes and get reported!
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,fun hurt head after a while
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Thanks to you and your staff for VRChat. It is without argument the best social program on the world wide web. You have brought the world to your doorstep and made it just a little bit smaller in doing so.
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Very fun and social experience, would recommend."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"easily the best social vr app so far if what you want to do is design your own characters or build worlds.  the avatar interaction is super comfortable.  and i like that there's no teleporting, i find it better for group activities.  you can still kind of teleport if you're sensitive to motion sickness like some of us but your avatar moves at a normal pace, and then you catch up to it.  

vrchat is quite powerful already and is only going to get more so, i encourage everyone to get familiar with unity since it's easier than it looks and you can create your own little corner of the metaverse now."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"This is the killer social app that VR needs. With the vast amount of customization, and the diverse, friendly, and accepting community that already exists, I seriously doubt that any other social platform will ever come close. The creators of this app truly understand the needs of the VR community. If you have VR, you need VRChat."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"    Such a fun experience, meet some fun and interesting people and have had a lot of laughs.  Excited to see this evolve and become even better. If you're looking for some great social interaction this is the place to get them. 
   
"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"If you like 1984 or the saviours from the walking dead than VRchat is for you.

Say any curse word or if the admin doesn't like you, you will be banned on the spot. 

please make a G rating, M rating and A rating filter system similar to second life so this nanny state moderating can stop please.

EDIT: 6/01/18 

Since the game has Exploded with popularity The Ban happy modernation mentallity is now very rare and the game is actually enjoyable now"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Good games and community.  Its free .
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"10/10 I had a great time, met Hitler and Thrump."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,I like it... Its like Second Life...
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Best social VR app. Custom, full body avatars? Friendly devs? Fingers on the Vive? Flying into forbidden areas of the penthouse? Nice Hub and ""hyperspace"" loading screen... Yesssssss. Can't wait for it to grow and be full of activity all the time!"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"After 2 hours of playing this game i gotta say that i would recommend this game!
You can play VR mode  and or Desktop Mode
At first i thought this game was just VR only till i figured that it can be used in these 2 modes
Other thing is you can meet new people, Plus they are friendly! (By the way, i didnt know that you can visit their creative worlds, i visted one when i first played this game and it was amazing!)
However, there is most games in VR chat that require just one hand and some games that you need VR only (less they update it, witch it is still early access)
This is going to be my new favorite game and i gotta admit, its addicting.
Keep up the great work devs!"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Geniunely a great concept, love the interaction part. Few minor bugs but a brilliant Free-To-Play"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,10/10 a modern masterpiece
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,soooooo fun i love!!!
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Holy cow! It actually works with a DK!. It was quite an experience to be able to be in a virtual world, chatting to the friendly ppl that reside there. I can only wonder what it must be like with the CV1 or Vive."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Partytime!
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,The Ugandan people showed me the way to enlightment I am now a proud member of Uganda.
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,You haven't lived until you have seen a slime girl Camilla.
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Bad moderators. Ban people for playing their game in ways they don't like. Feels like they're trying to cater to either an audience of SJWs or people under 10 years old. Also, the game has glitches which have been present in it for the 2 years before it came to Steam. Want to fly? No problem, just jump off a cliff and continually press whatever button you have bound to forward. Did you work hard on rigging a character to play as in the game? Too bad for you, the moderator is triggered by your avatar and will ban you from the game if you don't change it."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,It Really Awsome place To Chat with other people you can make your own Avatar in Unity if you look up with youtube video about it. It show how to make them
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"WOW.
I can't believe this is FREE!
"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"I  DONT  LIKE IT
"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,its like second life with autism
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"this game wouldent even start up loading got to 80% then just stoped i have a great pc and wifi i got it so me and my friend can play around and have some relaxing fun instead of fighting to the death in other games but my freind got in and sead a guy went over to him and was very rude and nobody cared he got called a and i quoght a 
""niger"" and he uninstalled it (EDIT) idk why i reviewed this game in this light i dont play it since i have old drivers but it seems to be a good game to play and meet new people"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Did ya ever play Second Life? If so....
1. You sick bastard, how do you sleep at night!?
2. The local authorities have been notified.
3. You'll get this game.
4. I don't like this game.
5. If the devs contact me and ask why, I will not respond.
6. How to make a souffle? Reply in the comments below. I need this to impress my friends at a dinner."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"As a furry, being able to present myself using an anthro character in VR is very important to me. So far this is the only app (other than Anyland which is just too much going on to be useful) where I can create and upload an avatar that represents how I prefer to see myself. It's quite new, so the process of creating and uploading an avatar is still very complicated and buggy. Many people complain that they upload avatars and they can select them, but they never rez. There's also the thing where you have to map every individual part of your body that moves (including each individual finger) to your avatar in the Unity application before you can upload it. On another note, the things you can do in this VR space are fairly limited and static: There's never anything new, so the few demo worlds that are available are all you get, and it gets boring quickly. It's like the devs just arrived at a point where they went ""okay this is enough content, we're done."" At the moment there's no way to change the luminosity of other avatars, so you've got those people who will crank the luminosity to maximum on their models so they glare in your face like direct sunlight. You've also got people who will make gigantic room-filling avatars and stand there waving their arms around in groups of people. While this app is an excellent concept, I see the freedom people have with avatar creation being stifled quite a bit because the way it is now just isn't scalable; the potential for abusive avatars palpable. Basically imagine all the problems jerks cause inSecond Life, but now it's all around you in 3D space."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Full of weirdos
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Vrpill the head admin is outright abusing on anyone who is a fan of ""Britbongreturns"" who he bans unfairly and for no reason for promoting the game?

The other admins also ban people for just casually having fun and enjoying the game, avoid at all costs."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Pretty fun. Runs great. Is simple and easy to get into. Doesn't require a headset. Interesting worlds. Looking forward to updates.
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Gonna see if i can get the first pc ban on this game...Anyone wanna race?
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"MUST HAVE: VR title.

It's f*cking FREE! Just try it!!!!"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,full of autists
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,stuck on loading screen
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,shady
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Incredible!  It gets better all the time!
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"The game looks great but i have an FPS problem. This problem is also affecting the microphone. No one can hear me, they say i sound like a robot. I have seen other people with the same issue. Talked with one dev inside the game and he told me to send some log file to them. I did it but i had no reply. hope they are working to solve the issue because the game is really good."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"A fun pioneering environment for creating shared experiences and experiencing surreal encounters with a wide range of humanity. Creative-minded folks can use the free Unity editor to import avatars and create shared virtual environments.  It's fun to run on the desktop, but you really need to try it in VR for the full immersive effect.

In short, VRChat is full of friendly helpful people, thoughtful role-players, goofballs, storytellers, casual chatters, and all of them part of a supportive community working to build a shared dream."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Love the game and cant wait for more updates. ps i would love to see a workshop come out of this
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,The ability to customize through Unity is awesome. I can see myself spending a lot more time in here.
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,FUNNY THIS WILL GET BIG
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,I have recently downloaded this game and fell in love with how awesome the game and concept is.  i met one of the admins and he was very helpful.  this is a must have if u are hanging with ur friends and wanna just chill.  so far one of the best games ive played on yet.
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Awesome software truely amazing things already and the future is so promising developers are in amongst you and taking constant feedback and everyones so friendly genuinely such a cool game
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Could be the closest you get to a ""Second Life"" VR experience. 
Friendly people with interesting avatars. 
Developers and team members constantly ingame and answering questions.
Whoever made that Disc Battle game deserves a medal!
Only things I could suggest is hopefully workshop support for custom avatars, and a push-to-talk mic function. 
5/5"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,so good
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Plays great on desktop PC. Also ..it's FREE!
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Best social VR app out right now. The avatars and play possibilities puts VRChat in a league of its own compared to the other entrants in the social VR space. So far the vibe is friendly and open and hosts have a range of tools to kick/ban trolls. However avatar customization is done offline so for the moment you are stuck with stock avatars unless you know how to rig, animate, blend etc. Free SDK allows uploading content and avatars for so at least the devs can build experiences for the rest of us without having to pay for SIM space! Bring on the block chain economy / super agro privacy settings --don't store my PII and the NSA can't ask you for it-- and VRChat has a solid chance at becoming a big part of the evolving metaverse."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Lots of neat mini-games and environments.  This is sure to become a VR staple.
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"This game is has many things that are still in development, but is amazing beyond that fact! You have an avatar that moves like you move, including squatting and lying down. This game is pretty cool to meet people with and I had a lot of fun when I played it! Deffinately worth the play for anyone who likes to socialize and goof around with random people around the world."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Absolutely love VRChat and it's openness to user-generated content. The IK system for the avatars works really well especially if you find an avatar with proportions similar to your own body.

Pros
Stays pretty active with between 20-50 people at almost any time of day (pretty good for vr multiplayer)
Devs and moderators are really active, helpful, and love to show off what VRChat can offer
A few good CTF style games to play and Tron discs
Open to user-generated rooms so there could be more really fun stuff coming out soon
Easy to grab people from the hub and have them join you in a game
Easy to see what people are already playing or hanging out in
Its totally free
There are rooms where you can hang out and watch youtube videos with people
If a room is full, you can easily create a new instance of that room for new people to join

Cons
You need a pretty good understanding of Unity to create your own content (devs/community are making tutorials though)
Can sometimes be buggy/drop frames but not too often
Not as popular/active as Rec Room
There arent currently a ton of fun games
No user market place or workshop so you can easily download new avatars/etc (i think devs are considering it currently)

All things considered, VRChat is pretty dang amazing and a good spot to hang out and chat with people or play some fun games."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,Wish it was easier to get a custom avatar into the game. Besides that this game is great
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"VRchat with HTC Vive- Amazing even being a little buggy, this has unbelievable potential.  If you have VR, you must have this."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Look, you can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it. It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it. You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really good.

What I *am* going to try to do is let you know about a few things before you buy that I don't see a lot of people telling new players.

First, and maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*
- What does this mean?
If you buy FFXIV from Square Enix directly you can only buy future expansions from them and only them. This means that if steam is having a sale on the expansion you cannot participate in it. The same goes with Steam. If you buy the game on Steam you can only buy future expansions from steam and not Square. This can be frustrating as I've seen people buy their game from the wrong place and waste money. Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.

Second, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different
- What does this mean?
There are two types of subscriptions. 
The first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.
The second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. 
There are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. 

Third, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character
- What does this mean?
Every character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.

Overall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,did you know that FINAL FANTASY XIV™ has a free trial up to level 60 that includes the entire base game as well as the critically acclaimed first expansion Heavensward™ with no time restriction
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Played WoW for 16 years or so. Switched to FF finally been playing past couple days nonstop. Dont regret a single minute of it. Cant wait to start the actual expansions though. Already recommended to all of my friends that play WoW.


!!Update!! 

100 Hours more played later. Im completely addicted. Still have yet to hit the first expansion. Just content everywhere I look. I cant remember the last time I genuinely woke up or got home from work and was excited about actually sitting down continuing an adventure on a game or just to have pure fun and enjoyment. One of best communities I have had the pleasure of starting to be a part of as well. Experience is still amazing for me so far. And I know its just going to get better and better. Cant wait!"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"This game presents itself for a large part of the main story as a single player RPG experience; the story is qualitywise comparable to single player Final Fantasy games which – in my opinion – is already an achievement. What really sets aside this game is the love for detail however. I was not expecting a world so full of life, colorful characters and well written plots. Especially the side adventures feature lots of comical elements.

The combat system feels refreshing. You get visual announcements to know what to do and where not stand. Learning by doing is often a welcome approach. You get extra rewards for having someone in your group who has not done the content yet.

The jobs in this game start out with a very basic concept but soon develop into a very well rounded and fun toolkit. The cooldown between the skills may make the battle system look slow at first but you keep unlocking skills that build up on those basic concepts in order to be able to create own solutions and approaches for all types of battles. The jobs differ nicely from each other in terms of core gameplay and positioning. All classes can be played on one character at the switch of a weapon and a crystal. Just to mention a few of many: There are summoners who utilize some of the well known summons of previous games to battle, healers who utilize white healing and protective spells to keep the group healthy or certain gunblade wielding tanks who give you a heavy sense of nostalgia. You will be able to unlock a mount in the form of a Chocobo early on who will also join you as a companion in battle. Different roles (damage dealer, healer or tank) can be taught to your Chocobo as skills. The chocobo is customisable in terms of color and gear (purely cosmetic).

Groups for content can be accessed by a search function or self-created. The size of the group (4 up to 24) depends heavily on the amount of time and effort you would like to invest. Queue times usually are not too long and can easily be bypassed by picking up a small adventure or two on the side. Hard content with different levels of progression is present in this game but not mandatory meaning that if you really want a challenge you will not have a trouble finding it.

There even is an amusement park, Gold Saucer, already known to some of you from playing Final Fantasy VII, which can be accessed to play small adventure games or e. g. Triple Triad (just as glorious as in Final Fantasy VIII) or to hang out with friends. You can purchase an appartment or a house which you can fill with self-created or purchased furnishings. You could even shape the layout to your liking. The location can be picked depending on which country you enjoy the most.

One of the jobs offers access to instruments (for example keyboard, guitar, flute) that can be used to perform. In some of the main cities you can sit down and watch people perform – sometimes even concerts are being held.

Flying is easily acquired in almost every zone by progressing the main story (not early on). Teleporting makes traveling fairly comfortable and easy. Leveling can be done with a variety of questing, dungeons or (non-instanced) world content. With a few weekly challenges you can get secondary jobs up to level swiftly.

The crafting system is a true gem. There is a variety of professions to pick from (e. g. goldsmith and carpenter). They are easy to pick up and items can be crafted with different qualities. A quality craft requires a certain amount of points to be acquired – this can be done by performing different kinds of rotations (you will pick up skills for this – just like in the jobs – while leveling up). There are also gathering professions that will yield you some of the required materials. Monsters can be avoided by a skill learned at early levels to gather efficiently. Later on you can even use your crafting to help rebuild a city.

The graphics are pretty and had – in comparison to a few other more current games – quite a low inpact on my system. With mid range components form years ago I could pretty easily play on high to maxed out settings. The animations are fluid and everything you press in combat feels (and looks) impactful.

Another awesome aspect of this game is the community. It is fairly easy to meet other players who also look for an enjoyable and positive experience. This game features a newbie chat where you can ask questions while playing. Mentors are also part of this chat to help. Becoming a mentor requires quite a bit of work in terms of ingame activies but from what I have seen people treat it as a privilege. Asking for help rarely goes unanswered here at pretty much all times. 

This game can be easily accessed and putting it down for something else was never an issue. Even a small amount of time can provide you with a good experience. I progressed the story in the evenings the last few weeks and was really impressed by how many weekly challenges feel optional instead of mandatory.

A few final words? First of all chapeau for releasing A Realm Reborn and Heavensward as free content (the core game and first expansion). Reading all of the above again this review feels overly positive – so far more than 300 hours in this game have not changed my mind. I wish I would have stumbled earlier upon this gem of a game. The love for detail in pretty much every direction is amazing. Thank you for all the hard work of developing this game over the years.


tl;dr: One of the finest RPGs and even single player experiences out there, even though its an MMORPG. Easily accessible. Creative and unique job and crafting system with depth. More than 200 hours of free content."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Less to do with the game and more the steam client for it. If you have an old account do NOT purchase anything through steam. Accounts are branded permanently either windows or steam and purchases do NOT cross over/codes cannot be redeemed for the other. You will also NOT be able to login the steam version with a windows account etc and all purchases are NOT refundable for this game on steam.

FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"World of Warcraft refugee here.

I've been playing World of Warcraft for quite some time, and with quite some time I mean a few darn years. 
I am so used to that game that any other game just seems to dogshiz compared to it. 
Due to Blizzard having such a delay in releasing their content with their latest expansion I've decided to give Final Fantasy XIV Online a try.

Expectations weren't that high, as I am just trying to look for a game I want to play due to WoW boring the living hell out of me.
It entirely surprised me how much content this game has to offer. I don't even know where to get started with this; so let's start with the character creation.

OPTIONS!  So many options, More than WoW I'd say at this point. You can mix and morph stuff you want, colours and haircuts. Facial structures and all types of dazzle wazzle.
I am not much of a weeb myself but I already took a liking to the game from the get-go.

After creating my character and entering the game, and learning that I can play -any- class on this character, makes me have 0 need for an alt; at least. As far as my game knowledge goes, Which is perfect for someone like me.

The Playerbase is SUPER friendly. Me and a buddy dinged lvl 50 and some random guy came over and told us about the game and introduced us to so much stuff, helped explain a lot and answered a lot of questions. Even invited us to a chat for new players where we can ask all our questions.

The combat by far is something I like. Though I am playing on NA servers while I myself am EU, the delay is there. But it is not that noticable. It's rather smooth and enjoyable.

The fact this game doesn't charge you your entire savings to rename or change character appearance is also a massive bonus compared to World of Warcraft.

Unfortunately; due to having the ""The Road to lvl 70"" Buff, we aren't really able to play the game fully, we're mainly just racing through the Main Story Questline, and are by far a few levels ahead of it!

Don't really have to add much other than, 31+ hours in and I am having a -blast-"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"As a long time MMORPG player, I used to judge FF14 by its graphic, see friends plays it, but never convince myself to play it. Until one day i just jumped in and give it a chance. Look at me now, just about a year or so, i maxed out all the classes, got the mentor, cleared savage content, loving the story with the music (one of the best story if not the best in the ff franchise).

If i have to name one bummer, it got to be the pace at the beginning, the combat is slow and fetch quests are tedious. Imagine doing 2.0 quests without flying, ahahaha.....ha, ha, yeah.

if the subscription based model doesn't turn you down, give it a try, there's a free trial."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"I played something called World Of Warcraft for years, like many others. But after spend 1 month in this game, I never going back, this is by far the best MMO I played in an long long time! And it just keeps getting better and better!"

That being said, if dinosaurs had access to FFXIV back then they would very much enjoy playing it! As you know, dinosaurs only played the best MMORPGs out there. Since they can't do it anymore, I think it's only fair we do it for them. Or do it for fun, I don't care, I love this game and you should try it out too!"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Chocobos. 14/14
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Overall the game is great.  The fact that you can play with very few restrictions all the way to level 60 is fantastic. It makes it so you really don't have to spend any money on the game to know if you will like it. There are quite a few things unique to this MMO compared to others, so my biggest advice is to come in with an open mind.  There are some quality Youtubers out there that give great insights on different aspects of the game, so if you want to know how specific systems or classes work definitely watch a few of those.

PROS:
-New player and veteran friendly
-World design is so unique and gorgeous from region to region
-The community is friendly and always willing to help new players
-Each class is very unique and feels that way in combat
-Leveling alt classes is fast due to the built in xp boost
-End game is much more accessible than an MMO like WoW due to the shorter required times to run Trials and raids compared to full raids in WoW
-Large XP gained from relatively easy quests makes them feel very worth it

CONS:
-Much of the story is told via text which can make those scenes feel less immersive
-The game takes away your abilities when running lower level dungeons rather than scaling down the effectiveness of the abilities and allowing you to continue using them
-Loot drops much less frequently than in most other MMO games
-Purchasing a story skip without a level boost will likely ruin your early game experience with the game"

But bro, I don't think it's a joke anymore."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,thanks for the crippling addiction to catboys guys
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"This is one of the best games on the market now. Shadowbringers specifically, is the best Final Fantasy story ever, and even one of the best in all of video games. The gameplay, while different depending on what you've played previously (I'm primarily a FPS player), is super satisfying and very engaging. If you like great stories, incredible music, or fantastic characters, you should play this. No questions asked.

I would recommend buying this off of Square's own website and setting your account up there, as there is less hoops and tape to go through down the line if something does happen like it did for me.

The combat-gameplay is something I didn't think I would like that much. As someone who has mostly played action and FPS games, when I experienced the early level combat, I was severely unimpressed. It was hard to control with the keyboard, and it was just super linear and boring. Now, I think that combat is one of the best types of combat I've played. This is tied to two things: the class abilities, and the controls. The class/jobs get more complex the higher level you are. At around level 40, the jobs start being more involved, with skill combos, rotations, and a bunch more that I don't have the word count to describe. All jobs are both fun and good, so no worries about picking a ""bad"" job. For controls, I highly recommend getting the 12 num-pad mice if you want to use mouse and keyboard. Don't know the controller experience. It is the only reason I stuck with the game as I was very frustrated with the controls very early on. I can't understate how much of a game changer this was for me. 

There are two roadblocks for people that are unfamiliar with MMO's compared to other games: time needed to play, and paying for it. 

Regarding time, the hours I have on Steam are just me playing Realm Reborn (ARR), Heavensward (HW), and Stormblood (StB). On my Square Enix account, I have 670 hours, which starts at the end of Stormblood as I skipped the expansions the second time around. This takes a long time to play, and about half of the 276 hours are pretty bad. ARR specifically is almost entirely forgettable, and has almost nothing in it that I would recommend you go play. However, playing through it is something I would say you do, as it sets up other story lines in future content, and those will feel less impactful if you do skip ARR. Past ARR, the game improves dramatically. The missions are all better, combat is more interesting, the story involves more engaging characters, it's all just better. Won't saying anything more, but if the first 100 hours were a slog, the next 170 will fly by.

On to pricing, which will seem daunting at first. First off, you can play ARR and HW completely free of charge. This is great, as HW is amazing on it's own and shows how great the story can be. In terms of everything else, you have to pay for the StB and Shadowbringers (ShB) expansions along with the monthly subscription. Again, I would purchase and manage everything through Square's own page and not Steam. I will say that this is well worth the price of admission. You can turn off your payments for the month if you just want a break, and you'll lose no progress or anything if you do. You don't pay for any playable content, outside of the expansion, any time. There are both cosmetic purchases, which are up to you on how you feel, but there are story skips and job level boosts. I would highly recommend against both of these. The story is by far the best part of the game, and isn't worth skipping. (Maybe ARR if you are on the verge of quitting because of it) As for the jobs, they get complex pretty fast, and if you jump in with no clue what you're doing, it'll be a bad time. I would just steer clear as it has more problems then benefits.

If you read all this, I hope you consider giving this game a play. The trailer for Shadowbringers, which is two years old, gives me goosebumps whenever I watch it because of how much impact it made on me. Even some of the songs will make me tear up because of the moments they represent. Not many games have that level of impact."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Best MMORPG's ever created
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,the account registration is hard
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"  Ive played a few mmo's in the past (Wizard101, BDO, Runescape, WoW) and I have to say FFXIV is by far my favorite. It has a great story which makes leveling a pleasure instead of a chore. And unlike in WoW I can actually explore without ripping my hair out because I get swarmed by mobs if I get within 100 ft of them. Instead now most mobs will ignore me even if im right on top of them. Im a casual player and I love how relaxing it is to play this game. The music is awesome and just makes the experience that much better.
  As a casual player I dont really find dungeons/raids enjoyable at least I didnt in WoW and the few dungeons Ive done so far I FFXIV havent been any better. But one thing FFXIV does have that I love which WoW doesnt is the trials (Just fighting one boss in an arena). I absolutely love the trials in this game and when I finish the story and max out my character those will be what ill be running for fun.
 In conclusion FFXIV is an amazing game which I would recommend to any MMO fan.

FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Game is still downloading and its already better than wow
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Do not buy from Steam.

All of my data is in Steam from my previous purchase and 95 hour playtime from a few years ago, as were the expansions I h ad bought and played. Bought Shadowbringers through Steam and their access code is 'invalid' according to the Square Enix site. 

The most help Steam offers is a 'Sorry that content isn't on our refund list. Here's a link to a page with a link to Square Enix support.'

Just go straight through Square Enix. This is not worth the headache and the loss of $50."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"One of the best mmos available at the moment. I was, and still am, a longtime fan of World of Warcraft and this game does most things way better. The soundtrack is stunning, the characters and fashion are beautiful, and the world is diverse and full of life. My only complaint so far has been that none of the npc speak to you with their voices, it's entirely text-based conversation; not even a ""Hello!"" voiced when you click on them. There are no voices. This would be almost a deal breaker if I didn't have people to play with, as the not being able to hear idle chatter in the background or be greeted by npcs is extremely lonely, which is not how I want to feel while playing an mmo. Still, even with that compliant, the game is quite remarkable and I see myself enjoying many hours in it's well crafted world. It's superior to WoW in almost every way except for pvp and npc voicing. I recommend playing with a friend in vc so you aren't lonely, but that's just me."

FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Calling all WOW refugees......
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"I switched over from WoW because of the massive gap between 9.0 and 9.1, and getting generally burned out. FFXIV is excellent and I'm really enjoying it. The music and story are front and center, in true FF fashion. You have to go through main story quests to unlock long distance travel and dungeons for example. 

There is a lot I can say here but to be brief: ARR (that's level 1-50 content) is decent and then it only gets better from there. It's a game that somehow seems to keep getting better and better the further you get. SB (level -70-80) content is a league ahead of the rest, and judging by the trailer for the next expansion, it's about to get even better.

Some basic MMO specific info:

They do have typical dungeons and raids, with a tank, a healer, and 2 dps.

Queues for dungeons are typically 5 mins

They also have raids, they come in 2 difficulties, roughly equal to Normal and Mythic from WoW

All content from all expansions is viable at level cap. Think of it as permanent time-walking if you're coming from WoW, but you will get tokens that are viable for endgame gear

They have single boss fights (a bit like World Bosses in WoW) that they call trials, and those start early, like level 20 ish, and also scale up to end game

PvP I haven't tried yet, but I'm told this is not the MMO for you if you're into PvP, try Guild Wars 2 instead.

Yes there are mounts and that includes flying mounts. They have all the other usual collectibles as well, and achievements, titles, /dance emotes... nothing seems to be missing in the 'casual' category

Community is probably better here than in any MMO. New players will have a 'sprout' icon next to their name, and veteran players have incentives for helping you out. It's a brilliant system; they have really cultivated a friendly community by design. And somehow I see less ""weebs"" and ""ERP"" types here than in WoW, despite what you'd expect from a game where one of the playable races is cat-people and FF tends to attract anime fans. People are surprisingly ""normal"" here

Anyway, I say give it a shot. It's a fantastic game with a lot of great players."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Overall Impressions: Final Fantasy XIV is able to deliver a genuine MMO experience and a RPG experience all in the same game. The story driven narrative plays out similar to a JRPG and you can expect over 150+ hours of the main story. Side stories adds to the immersion and the world building established by the writers and reinforces the diverse world of Eorzea. Almost all activities outside of the main story can be enjoyed in a multiplayer experience. From 4-man content like dungeons to 8-man content like trials or raids to 24 man content like alliance raids, this game will push you to play with others and reinforces the ""MMO"" in mmorpg. Square Enix also introduced a lot of miscellaneous activities that gives the players a fresh and novel experience such as deep dungeons, Eureka, and Bozja.

For casual gamers, this game offers a relax pacing. Extreme trials, normal raids, alliance raids, relic content can all be beaten by gamers of any skill level. Developers will often introduce new game content that encourages players to rerun older content such a mount farming, relic questline, relic farming, etc, so old content is never truly phased out of existence. PVE content is also not the only facet of this game. Crafting and gathering has an arguably larger percentage of player participation than raiding and FFXIV players will often say that ""housing is the true endgame""."

FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"As someone who is a big Final Fantasy fan, I was always a bit dubious about playing XIV as it was an online platform. I didn't like the idea of relying on other people to get through dungeons and raids, particularly since I'm quite social awkward and get anxious. However, taking the chance on it was the best thing I could have done. I found a FC of people I love as well as found some of my best friends through the game. The story and graphics are incredible, and I can only say that if you are worried about playing the game because of the same reasons I did, don't be. You'll find people just like you on there and you'll probably end up like me and lose your life to the game. It's an absolute masterpiece that's just gotten better and better."

FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"I'm writing this review as someone who would be considered, by most standards, to be a ""WoW Refugee."" If you've been finding yourself in a similar situation where you're in need of an MMO itch, but the main game you play isn't helping you, then I'd recommend giving this a shot.

Pros: - A character can be every class and master every profession. There's no need to worry about making different alts to see every corner of the game. If you'd like to stick to one person for the entire experience, you can.

- More involved storytelling than I've seen in other MMOs. Everything slowly builds throughout expansions as opposed to things being brought up and then subsequently abandoned when the next big content update rolls around.

- The art style can be hit or miss for folks, but I like it. The soundtrack didn't need to go as hard as it did, but Christ, you feel the hype.

- The community is, by and large, the least toxic community that I've seen in an MMO. You've got your gold sellers and trolls, but honestly, what large scale game doesn't have a few of those? I've had more pleasant experiences here so far than I have in other social games with people willing to teach and run through mechanics multiple times.

- UI customization. I have a friend that could spend hours tweaking what his UI looks like, and in this game, you don't even need an addon to do it. (Just as well, because the default one it gives you is, uh... a choice.)

- Glamours! You can make your character look however they want. You want to look like a typical adventurer? Sure fam. You want to walk around in a golden speedo with a chicken head? Go with God! You want to look like a cypertech abomination? We aren't going to stop you. While inventory space for your glamoured items is limited, I can't see anyone realistically running out of room for the outfits they'd constantly want to use. Compare this to WoW, where even the most basic of items for transmogging are locked behind weird caveats just ""because.""

However.

Cons: - We need to address the elephant in the room here. When everyone talks about the good story, they're talking about expansions, NOT the base game. It starts out fine enough, but it goes into a slog really fast. I'm sorry, folks, it's rough. It ain't good. There's only so much you can do for worldbuilding and fetch quest stuff before it starts feeling like padding. This is also AFTER they've done some pruning to the questlines. It took everything in my power not to buy that little boost that skips a character directly to Heavensward.

If you even have to offer something like that to people, there's a problem. There's also only so many times you can tell someone ""just to power through it"" and that ""the good stuff comes later"" when this is their first impression. If you have the patience, you should be good. If you don't...

- This is less a gameplay issue, but a technical one. Logging in through Steam, going through Mogstation, and setting everything up can be a real hassle. I've heard stories of people being charged multiple times for the same game or getting a new phone and having to re-fangle with their account to get the authenticator to work again.

- Combat for some classes can feel a bit slow in the earlier levels. This is perfectly fine for an MMO. What's *not* fine is having some of the abilities that are core to your rotation and really start making your gameplay interesting coming in at levels 50-60ish. Wanderer's Minuet, something that as a Bard player I quickly realized was essential in my arsenal aside from Mage's, I didn't learn until level 52. I can't speak the same for others. Will have to play the game more for that.


Tl;dr: Give the game an honest shot, whether you're looking for an RPG or an MMO to sate that urge. The community is good, the customization is better still, and the gameplay, while slow at the beginning, can ramp up quickly enough to keep you entertained."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,50 hours in and it's all the little things that make it for me
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,sexc game yes hair very good yes
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"persona 3 come to pc.
Jove dies"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,It's pretty good
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Gameplay is slow at first but if you can get through the beginning it is very fun. Expect to play this game a lot if you get into it.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,i came into this game with a LOT of reservation.... but 3 weeks later this is better than the 7 remake.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Best MMORPG around
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Best MMO I have ever played. The ability to multi-class on a single character is amazing, the graphics are beautiful and the combat style is on-point. Would 100% recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good MMO to call home."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"After playing a fair amount of hours now i will have to say that this is honestly one of the best MMOs i have played. it has compelling stories amazing characters and the customization is amazing so long as you dont want to customize your class. there are a lot of outfits to choose from a lot of armors to use as a glamour  and they allow model mods. (addons like recount for damage is against the TOS so you dont have to worry too much about someone bitching about your damage output online).

*Pros*
 - you dont have to worry about being yelled at for damage
 - great story and characters
 - solid character customization
 - lots of classes and life skills to choose from
 - friendly overall community.

*cons*

 -little to no class customization
 - novice network isnt all that helpful (the novice chat is on par with barrens chat from wow..)
 - a bit on the easier side where mmos are concerned.

in a world of cookie cutter mmos and companies being unable to innovate or take risks Final fantasy XIV is a very valid choice and a very fun one at that. the game doesnt do a whole lot thats wholely unique but it does what it can in the enviroment it was made in. it would be nice if it was less tab target and more action but sadly those sorts of MMos are few and far between and normally tend to be super grindy slogfests.

 in short what final fantasy does do it does quite well.
"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"The best MMORPG since World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King. Best story, best characters, beautiful world, a complex and fun combat system, thrilling battles, great endgame, and a fluid job system featuring waaaaaay too many jobs for a casual like me (I've mained a single job since 2015 and only maxed three jobs).

XIV makes great use of the Final Fantasy universe, especially VI, drawing partially from what feels like every major title while maintaining its own distinct identity. Aesthetic, combat, jobs, items, villains, there's a lot of fan service but as a fan I love it.

The only thing WoW has over XIV, the only thing I feel XIV lacks, is a good PVP system. The closest equivalent is 1v1 dueling, but good luck as a beginner. Battlegrounds reduce everybody to the same baseline stats and highly limited job moveset. I don't bother with PVP due to the milquetoast, constrained experience.

XIV would be a very fun, very enjoyable game as an offline, single player adventure. It's true that the online aspect presents drawbacks like long dungeon queues for DPS classes (since there are significantly more DPS jobs than tank or heal) but the recently introduced Trust system eliminates this problem for normal dungeons (no raiding) and allows you to run dungeons single player.

I've become less active because grinding for gear gives me an existential crisis and is boring besides, but I still recommend this game to everybody."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Nice game i recommend it!
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,By far one of the best MMOs I've played and the trail is really good for people looking to try this game.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"I've played WoW and ESO and enjoyed those, but wanted to try other mmorpgs out for when things slow down in those since I'm not much for post-story content.

FFXIV has been pretty fun so far! The graphics, while very anime, are lovely, and my character feels a lot more expressive and alive than in the other two games.

I also love (/hate) that the pressure to try alts is non-existent. You can switch between classes and seemingly experience nearly every story on one character. I do tend to have alt-itus in WoW and ESO (one of each race and at least one of each class), so it is a little annoying that I don't quite know how to justify going through all the effort to do the same story with another character just for an extra race!

One thing I'm not nuts about is that, to progress the main story (as early as level 15ish), you MUST run through multiplayer content (dungeons/trials). Have kids at home so you try to avoid getting locked into multiplayer stuff? Too bad, you're at a screeching halt in progression until you can set aside however long it takes to beat a dungeon. You can run side quests, but if you've kept up on those, it is a pain. To be fair, so far the multiplayer content has been incredibly easy -- took about 10 minutes to queue plus 10 minutes of following experienced players, and we were through. But then, 15 minutes later, there is another dungeon required! Agh! I looked it up, and this appears to be a thing every few levels. I guess that will be my use for an alt -- when my main character gets locked in the story and has to run a dungeon, I can switch to my other character until kiddo is asleep and there won't be interruptions. 

Last thought echoed by my husband when I convinced him to try the free trial -- the map system is certainly inferior to the other two mmorpgs we've played, but you get used to it after a while. I just wish addons were a thing like they are in WoW or ESO. I also wasn't a huge fan of ESO's map but a quick addon download was plenty to fix it and now I've long forgotten what the original system was. FFXIV to my understanding from google does not allow addons at all.

Overall, cute and active game, with tons of content to play. I've had no issues with lag like I do in WoW and ESO sometimes."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,poggers
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Pretty top notch game play.  A lot of good story.  Could be more action base but overall great game.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"This game follows the trend of other MMOs in that there are three roles: tank, healer, DPS. You  have an essentially open world wherein you can choose to do battle, gather things, meet other people for optional activities, take screenshots of the landscape and/or yourself, and so on. The breadcrumb series of major and minor quests will lead you around Eorzea, ever guiding you into higher level areas, introducing you to new NPCs, new encounters, and new gear. There's a lot of lore to unpack for each region if you're into that, there are minions, mounts, aesthetic gear, book logs, in-game cards, and other optional stuff to collect if you like. There's even a cash shop for even more aesthetic gear, and none of it will assist in your gameplay other than give you a particular look. You never need a cash shop purchase to be an effective player here.

Where this game differs slightly is in how it's all implemented. You are not locked into a single role or class, and this appeals to me greatly because I enjoy expanding my viewpoint of this game through different roles as my whim dictates. Wield a different weapon and bam, you are that class. Most classes start from level 1, and the benefit of that is that you can learn to play that class from the ground up. Each class has a basic rotation, with some extra stuff thrown in for extra/burst damage. Some of it is 1v1, some is AOE-centric. Most classes get their better attacks and more full rotation after lvl 50.

This is my seventh year of game play, and I still don't have all the mounts, all the minions, all the aesthetic gear, all the in-game cards, and so on. I have played a number of classes but I still have half of them to level to the maximum. I am a casual player and I still find reasons to log in every day--quests, gear, friends to party up with, personal goals, an ever-changing list of random things to do due to daily/weekly quests. Leveling is satisfyingly fast, gear is easy to acquire, and most dungeons and creature mechanics are pretty easy to figure out--they always show you what's going to happen and get you a taste of damage before they go ham. I have arthritic hands and I will never feature in the top tier of DPS because of that but I can still hold my own in combat and contribute meaningfully to a successful run. 

tl;dr
Cons: 
--GCD feels slow
--low-level combat is unsatisfying
--main scenario quests and instances are required to unlock higher level areas
--monthly subscription is required beyond the first expansion
--there is a small learning curve
Pros:
--optional cash shop is truly optional
--combat level 50+ starts getting good
--each area has its own lore, aesthetic
--you don't need to have played any other Final Fantasy game to thoroughly understand and enjoy your time
all players on PlayStation, PC, and Mac can coexist and interact with each other
--the free trial (limited in function, not in time) is still robust enough for you to truly see how this game is presented, allows you to interact with other players, and enjoy your time
--despite it being a Japanese-made game, there are robust English (also German and French!) voice-acting, text, and interface elements, allowing you to view and interact with this game in the way you choose in settings.

Please try it, I think you'll like it!"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,LA HEE!
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"IMO best MMO on the markert right now.
Robust and interesting story that has enough emotional scenes and twists.
No need for alt characters as you can level all jobs on one character and switch between them in a second.
A lot of content with interesting dungeons that have involving mechanisms right from the get go.
Awesome community.
Also remember that when you see a Falafel, slap it."

FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Final Fantasy does not do anything particularly new in the MMO genre. But it does everything that others do just as well, with the addition of a far superior story (Past the 50 hour mark). Trying it can be free or extremely cheap. So don't take my word for it."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,It's better than wow. If you're going to waste time do it here.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Gaming
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"This game, just wow. It's a slow burn, but once you hit the end of the main game and start the expansions it's far and away the best MMO on the market right now. Nothing even remotely holds a candle to it. If you haven't played, the free trial will get you through Heavensward, the first expansion. It's very worth trying and maybe making your main game for a while."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"best mmo class design, best endgame by far, community is great and also a little cringe"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Still loving it
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"This is hands down, the best MMO around and the only reason I didn't go insane during the pandemic."

Please, Have a good day and Have fun!


2/18/2017 Edit: Some of my outfit/platoon mates gave me some ideas as to what to put for the 10 things as I could only think of about 4 on my own :P 
So thanks to them to make this review entirely possible!

3/1/2017 Edit 2: a few more tips for you are   
1) dont run infront of your allies that are shooting, go behind them so you stay out of their line of fire.   
2) use the terain around you for cover.  
3) if your a Heavy Assault turn you shield on when entering cover, even if your not being shot at. reason is this is a CLIENT side game if you can see them, you can shoot them. so if your in cover they may still see you out of cover for a short time after because they havent recieved the info from you yet. so use the addage of ""I can see you, I can shoot you"" the same goes for the other players aswell   
4) Don't go straight for the enemy UNLESS you have several teamates with you. Try your BEST to FLANK the enemy. don't attack them head on. come at them from the sides, above, or even behind them, if one tactic dosen't work... Try something else. the fight is dynamic, just like you!  5) Finally, LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of your weapons, it WILL take time.


P.S. Feel free to add my on steam or PS2 (ingame) the name i listed is my primary although if you want i can tell you the others via PM or steam chat.

P.P.S. I added some tips my teamates and friends gave me. some others on Youtube, like Wrel (Dev) Nico101, Joshino, and others have also said some of these tips. If you want to know more about the game look them up on youtube Especially Wrel, as he's a developer. Nico101 I'd recoment to Older audiences, as there is some ""Humor"" that younger audiences may find offensive or dont understand. (he and his team swear a bit aswell) i do squad ops with them and its mostly moments of WTF?! and general fun. Joshino and Wrel are a great choice to see if you want to Learn more about the game, its mechanics and also for general info/guides for weapons or tactics. 

Now all this is simply my PERSONAL opinion, while i agree that some others may not agree with me, i hold my opinions of the game and the players in fair judgment. 

Also, if you have any ideas for tips/tricks/unspoken rules/etc. post them in the comments. I will add them to the list and give you credit. feel free do discuss this game in comments below. Happy Gaming everyone!"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Pros:
  + HUGE open worlds
  + Large servers
  + It's FREE

Cons:
  - Can be hard for new players
  - A little bit of grinding 

      Planetside 2 is an online tactical shooter in which you choose to be a soldier in one of three different factions that are involved in an eternal struggle for various planets. Each faction must capture control points in order to gain control of the planet. There are 6 different soldier classes which allow for large differences in personal gameplay. Give it a try because it is free.

 This game was curated for PC Beta Gaming - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Old review below.

Oh man, Planetside... Where do I even start with you?

Okay, let's start with the noticeable stuff first:
- The abyssmal performance:
The performance has been quite bad since launch. After years of patches, it still hasn't really gotten any better. The one trick they pulled was to label the old ""high"" settings to be the new ""ultra"" settings. I think you can see where this is going...
- The weapons:
A billion iterations of every weapon there is, with little to no differences between the guns themselves. Originally the factions were designed to have strengths and weaknesses. Now there are guns which every faction can use, which have no apparent weakness.
- The lags:
Oh god, the lags. Dying behind corners is pretty normal here. Also, other forms of glitching around, bad pop-in (like literally other players popping in 2 metres in front of you... yes, enemies aswell)

I could list several additional problems this game has, but I'm just tired. There is no hope here,



OLD REVIEW:

The game can be quite frustrating at the beginning until you get the ropes. Then it starts to be incerasingly more fun. I'd recommend getting into an outfit as soon as possible and participate in their squads, it will enhance your experience."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"You thought Battlefield was war. You were wrong. 

This is war. 

Battles with hundreds of people fighting on each side in Combined arms battles with air and land vehicles across maps that are more than 100 square kilometres. Grab your 980ti and hold on tight, because you're in for a treat."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"#Pros and cons#
Epic, unique, one of a kind. It's 2017 and still no game like this one.
A war, vast worlds, playground, massive battles (and also opposite), variety, tactical, outstanding.
A war, free2play but no child's playground.
Well in a chaotic massive battle everyone could find his role and spot......
Teamwork, lone wolf, support, scout, infiltrator, cloaked bugger, jetpack flank warrior, mechwarrior, tank force, air force, gatherer...
Unforgiving, complex and overcomplicated.
Outstanding deep ballistics.

Very very slow progress to unlock this and upgrade that, add these and fully uncap those. 
Grind or die, grind to win, play or pay. 
Anyway time is money. Free2play can turn into the most expensive game by far, by far. No respecs, no refunds.
Brainer. One way or another?
Yea, teamwork, leadership and tactics, that's what matters, 
well you will be facing the most equipped warriors and platoons over n over, also you will be swarmed...,
and well the factions and powers are kinda unbalanced and varied on purpose here and there, 
so you will be facing some OP sh1t over n over. A war.
Well yea mostly everything has a downside. Challenge, outsmart, tactics.
One faction population decrease, the faction can be outnumbered. A swarm. Depending on server, can happen often.
Limited numbers, sometimes queues to one world. At least playing underpopulated faction kinda prevents you from queues. Membership has priority. 

#Honorable mentions#
CPU demanding (average GPU is enough).
Dont expect 120+++ FPS, stable FPS
Beside ingame, you can edit config file for performance, visual clarity, FOV, etc.
Stuck in queue? Just try reenter the queue or ""Join Combat"" button every 1-2mins, should help."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"I think anyone who likes multiplayer FPS games should at the very least try out Planetside 2. This is a very special experience, I can’t think of another FPS that is as ambitious, varied, and outrageous in its dedication to all out chaotic war as this game. Thousands, and I mean thousands of real people at sitting at their computers all across the world battle in this never ending sci fi conflict from a first person perspective, all in glorious real time, and for the most part, it works. It’s astonishing to stare across a field at a giant group of advancing enemy infantry, easily larger than even the largest Battlefield server, snap to iron sights, and fire into the group and score a kill, only to get run over from behind by one of a hundred tanks cresting over the hill, firing in all directions like maniacs. The game is an MMO, but just the very fact that it still manages to feel like a standard FPS with decent controls and shooting mechanics is a grand achievement. Planetside 2 feels, at times, like the perfect game I wanted as a little kid while going “pew pew” with dozens of little plastic army men.

Like other MMOs, you can join an outfit (guild) and fight for one of three distinct factions. The scary red space communists (guns are weak but shoot fast), the freedom loving space Americans (guns are strong but shoot slow), and the spiritual xenophile space hippies (laser guns). These factions are engaged in an eternal conflict over several continents, and the game centers around various control points. Choose a class ranging from the vital medic to the jetpacking Light Assault and help out your team crush the enemy forces. The size of each continent is mind boggling, and while large stretches are usually unused for long periods of time, it is easy to find conflict zones and jump straight in by the game’s intuitive map system. See all of those flashing booms? Shit’s going down there, get in the meat grinder, soldier!

The land and air vehicles are easy to operate, and the infantry controls are familiar if you’ve played any recent FPS. There is a ton of variety in how the gameplay unfolds. One minute you are firing at distant targets in a barren desert from a tank’s turret, the next you could be dropped from a hovering Galaxy troop carrier into the thick of an intense CQB firefight. However, there are definitely long boring stretches of inactivity like in other MMOs, boring car rides or endless sprints to the objective that can become pretty grating over time. Thankfully, you can always kill yourself to respawn somewhere closer, or spawn on a mobile spawn truck known as the Sunderer, so if you’re an impatient type action is never too far away.

The game unfortunately isn’t perfect. Performance is all over the place, despite having a good system expect things to slow down in some of the more hectic combat moments, which is expected since the game is trying to render hundreds of people shooting each other. The F2P system isn’t too bad, the starting guns are definitely viable in combat, but in order to get another weapon or even to unlock a new attachment can feel very grindy at times. Players who spend a ton of money will definitely have an advantage over you in a 1v1 situation since they have access to more gadgets, scopes, etc. than you do, but since the battles are so chaotic and packed with people, this is rarely an issue. 

Planetside 2 is an ambitious game that truly makes you feel like you are a small cog in a giant sci fi battle. I feel as if many multiplayer FPS games are becoming more and more obsessed with making every player feel like a cool guy special forces operator, but Planetside 2 basically says, “You don’t matter, you’re one of hundreds of dumb grunts running around and you are most likely going to die real quick.” I really enjoy this and I wished more developers would work towards making a similar MMOFPS like this of our dreams. Imagine an MMOFPS set in Europe during WW2 (Not that Heroes and Generals shits), now that would be something I really like. Imagine Allied forces landing in player controlled LCVPs, while Axis Luftwafe strafe the beaches, and Panzer divisions massing for a counter attack. Now THAT's my dream video game. 

Planetside 2 is definitely worth trying out, it’s free, so why not?"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"I love this game! I play it on the PS4 a lot more than I should, honestly! It's a great game for those looking for a big open battlefield! 7/10, would play again."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Planetside 2 has ESCALATED to a whole new level.

I'm not wrong though, it's pretty awesome."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,I played this game for 75 days (that is 1800 hours) so far. I'm beginning to get into it.
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,Very Fun Game I have played it it gets boring if you play it everyday but yeah its a pretty good game
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Best free 2 play game I have ever played, It actually feels like a battle in a war, there can be sooo many players in one place at a time it's really is fun and unique unlike other games and it's also free so no reason why not to get it."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Great game with incredable large scale battles, or small 10 on 10 fights for a small outpost. Great weapon diversity and abilities which and unique dynamics to each fight. Would highly recommend everyone to try it for free."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This is one of the most difficult FPS games I've ever played simply because of the sheer number or people who can end up shooting at you because of the smallest mistakes... This game puts the OP in ""Teamwork OP"" because a well oiled outfit that has its tactics down can storm a base and turn the tide of a battle even when outnumbered. This game is not pay 2 win but it WILL require you to grind to acquire the gear you want if you're not interested in investing some money for DB cash. There are many class unlocks that cannot be bought and must be earned. 

At this point of the game (like 4 years running now) there are many vets on both sides with lots of gear/weapons unlocked and it can seem daunting for a new player. However the unlockable weapons tend to be sidegrades rather than an outright upgrade, meaning that the stats of the new weapon won't necessarily be better than the last but it may be better for different circumstances i.e. CQC, or Long/mid range fights. Each weapon excels in its own area.

I Believe there is even an xp bonus for soldiers under BR (Battle Rank) 15 to help you get some quick Cert points. I suggest medic for new players as you can earn a TON of xp without having to kill anyone and medics are SUPER useful in big or small fights."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"It's a decent game if there's a lot of players, but the PC version is dying, over the last week I've been on the U.S. West servers and there's never more than 75 people on, for one whole night there was only 3- 8 players at a time. If you want to play this game and enjoy it try it on a console, I played on PS4 periodically for the last year or 2 and it's always had a much larger player base during that period"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,well
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"I have a few hours logged and it is by far my favorite game.  I may drift away for a bit but I always come back.  This is everything you want in a war game.   You can change a battle by yourself or roll over your enemies in a 40 man platoon.  I grinded almost everything out f2p but ended up buying some camos so I could look sexy when I killed people.   
"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Pretty fun game. It's like Battlefield meets Diablo on a HUGE scale consistent conflict. However, after reaching rank 17, and I moved to areas beyond novice, the Pay2Win aspect showed it's ugly head. It got boring being 2-shot wasted by players with bought weapons- despite laying into them heavy with my weapons and they remain uneffected.

It's a free game and it was fun until I ran into those players over and over again. Something I'll play with my friends, but not on my own."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,i am litterally flying planes in real life yet i still cant fly in this game... but aside from that its the best game ever!! :D
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"I have 4 fps in the menu.
"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"One of my favorite games, nobody plays with me though"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Planetside is a great game, but it's dying.  It may not be the most graphically stunning or on par with more modern FPS open battlefield shooters but it has it's own flavor with its varying fights. Although people whine and complain about P2W because it's a F2P game thats not true, all weapons are to be used in their own way and Environment. Cross faction balancing is pretty good, seems one faction has better weapons? They really don't, theres always a downfall between factions.

The NC are hard hitting and close quarters, weapons with a high damage but low rate of fire is their specialty. At distance they are weak but if they get close they hit like a truck. One MAX unit with dual shotguns can quickly make way for allied units behind it and clear out the most clustered of areas.

The TR are fast firing and large ammo capacity, their weapons fire faster and need to reload less, at medium range with controled fire these guys can easily become the lead flinging harbingers of death. One heavy can easily clear a room of unexpecting enemies in one long spray of fire.

The VS are fast reload and almost no bullet drop (Damage drops at range still), Their bullets travel straight so no need to compensate for drop and coupled with a fast reload to get that last needed round downrange, Watch out for Vanu snipers, they can easily drop a man from long distance without the need to take extra time to gauge how high they need to aim.

I've been on every faction and have heard the many complaints about other faction weapons being too overpowered, or their weapons too underpowered. They are just not using their weapons properly or don't know how to control them. Same with faction specific vehicles like Light Aircraft and Heavy Tanks.

Planetside is a good game to try and very fun to get into when you learn the game mechanics of bullet drop, bullet travel, Nanites, Weapon Effectiveness, and squad strategy. The devs were even nice enough to throw in koltyr which used to be a place for new people to get used to the game mechanics in, but now is a great place to test and understand new weapons.

The planetside community is still active, we just need new players to liven up the servers a bit more. Most of us are willing to help and there are plenty of open outfits for you to join. A lone wolf does not hunt as effectively as a pack."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,SUPER PAID TO WIN........
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,Really enjoyed the combat despite the short playtime I've had. Lots of fun.
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Unique complex massive multiplayer shooter which struggles with lack of the players and bad optimalization. Do not let it die and give Planetside 2 a try, its free after all."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,The Grind is real!
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"- Join with a 4 man squad
- over 2000 players in the game
- Uber realistic battle simulator
- Lose track of time
- Play until 1:00 AM for the first day and then continue to watch videos on it all night
- Love the game, especially dropping as roleplaying as airborne.

10/10, AMAZING OPEN WORLD BATTLE SIMULATOR"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,No Russians
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"***Please do not let the low hours retract from this statement | I have played it much longer on the non-Steam version***

PlanetSide 2 came out five years ago and much has changed. From the old SOE days to now DayBreak, PS2 has changed somewhat substantially. There has been good and bad with every update and I should know; I admit I have a founder account and even played in the Alpha and Beta. This game has slowly and lethargically evolved over the years. While there are many that show disdain for the DayBreak I do not find them to be that horrid. Sure it feels somedays that the server population for Emerald isn't what it used to be (Remember when Emerald wasn't a thing and there were about three other servers/player account that got merged into it, I do.) but that does not mean that the game is dying, I keep running into new players every time I log in. Many of them are great and many are little sniveling CoD kids. The main draws of this game are and will forever be:

-Massive maps
-Massive fights
-Coordination/Teamwork
-Forward Operating Base/ HIVE building

I hope that this game will last for many more years as there really isn't anything else like it right now. I give the game a rating of 8/10, it's solid and I have stuck with it but there are still some old issues from the SOE days that were never addressed."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"The most original FPS I have played in a long time, and probably my favourite."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,crowded
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Its entertaining enough, the only problem is at this point, with the diminishing player base, its hard to find a reason to get into the game. Not to mention the grind is horrendous, the only people still playing are people like myself, who have hundreds of hours, and some money invested, so we have damn near everything unlocked. I would not want to be a new player in this community, because the game is pretty unforgiving."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,i havent played this game yet
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This is a pretty good game i have to say, but there are moments where you will rage like when your in the war with other people, im going to recomend this game to people who are good at shooting fps mmo's like call of duty gamers as its basically a never ending futurustic version of cod."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,It's a little on the pay to win side. But it's still a great game overall.
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"After the amount of hours I have spent in the game, I feel legit to give an honest review about it. I had FPS experience before I started to play PS2, mostly just casual gaming with various titles from the genre. Sadly I got spoiled too much of the scale that it is difficult to go back on those. The only reason I will play other FPS games too is to have more competitive and very controlled environment to try out own reaction times and skills in well known titles.

If you are expecting very polished and smooth experience with always balanced and fun fights, then PS2 might not be for you. There has been ups and downs during the game's life time, but dev team has done their best to keep the players satisfied.

At this point I want to say that put the game already to download, because it takes a while, unless you have limited data plan or small storage. Otherwise there is no reason to try out, except if you are easily addicted or do have unsupported operating system. Some of the older computers will have performance issues, but my oldish rig is doing fine with competitive performance.

What can you expect from the game:
[list]
    [*]You will die, many times, all the time.
    [*]There are people who have been playing this game since beta and they know every minor detail of their favourite weapons and good locations to kill you. But don't worry, there are also same people in your team, who will probably save you before you get in danger zone.
    [*]Game has cross faction textual chat for the area you are fighting, so expect to see people cursing how sad other team is by bringing too many players in the fight to break the population balance.
    [*]Some people don't have legs so they just sit in their vehicles all the time and try to shoot infantry with easy to kill cannons if they aren't in real danger.
    [*]Maps are quite huge, but usually the killer is hiding nearby even when the shot comes out of nowhere.
    [*]According the chat many people have RTS background, specially from StarCraft and from zerg faction.
    [*]You can play alone or be part of a squad of 12 players, which can be part of platoon of four squads, which can be part of some outfit public operations to run multiple platoons. Depending the situations you are alone or there are 96+ friendlies with you in same fight.
    [*]There are no matchmaking or any custom game etc. You are in your character in one of the five servers, in one of the four continents (not counting Koltyr the new player training ""continent""), in one of the many bases. There will or won't be enemies or friendlies, but you have all the right be in there.
    [*]It is very confusing at the first, because shots coming from all over the place or from nowhere. There is an in-game map, which you can use to navigate in the fights (think as joining a match).
    [*]You can get all the stuff with the in-game currency you get by playing the game. Only the swag and character vanity are restricted to DBC, which you get only with real money.
    [*]Weapons are ""sidegrades"" so that they specialize in certain roles, like gaining firerate by losing damage, etc.
    [*]You might get fully upgraded vehicles with swag from veteran players if you ask kindly.
    [*]There is no Pay-to-win, but you can buy XP boosts and premium membership to get more value out of your in-game actions, which will make your cert (in-game currency) gain faster. Also paying players might have squad boosts, which will affect to other players in the group, so F2P players can get extra XP boost without paying.
    [*]There are three different factions, that have different style of weaponry. For new players some might be easier to start with, because more controllable, but over the time it is just personal preference which backstory you want to support. Spandex babes, teamkilling blueberries or oppressive internationalists.
    [*]Community can send own cosmetic creation to player studio to get them in game.
    [*]There is no PC-PS4 realm, so can't show the PC master race dominion to console plebs. (/s)

[b]TL;DR:[/b] Gud gaem, not ded gaem, not P2W, crying redditors, nice content creators, Player studio <3<3"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,great game highly recomend to anyone that loves a good grind and a open world shooter 11/10
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This game truly encapsulates the feeling of being blindsided by some invisible guy 20 bajillion miles away.

More often than not, that guy could also be one of your team mates in the spawn room."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Picture a mix of Halo, Star Wars: Battle front, and some other massive, class based fps with awesome vehicles...and you're picturing PlanetSide 2. Really great game."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Ive been playing for a couple of years now (on ps4 and pc) i got to quite a high level on ps4 as vanu but i have only played a couple of hours on pc because i brought other games and got addicted to them for months. I recently had to restore my computer so iam gonna install it again right now and start playing again. Absolutely worth downloading it has everything you would want from a shooter and more. 3 empires fighting it out in one huge continent (huge fucking maps, not your call of duty or battlefield bullshit), Different terrains that suit different playstyles for example if you like playing pilot dont play on Hossin because its a dense jungle and you cant see infantry for shit. Hossin is more for infantry. Its pretty good for inflitrator because you can use the trees and stuff for cover. It has Exellent weapon customization and really gives you a veriety to choose from once you have enough certs (in game currency). By Level 10 you should have at least 1000 certs and that can get you one of the best weapons. Say for example you like playing inflitrator, by level 10 you can spend your 1k certs on the most powerful sniper for whatever faction you are playing as (each faction has different weapons with different capabilities). Each faction has different vehicles also. Last time i played there was atleast 500 players in the game and it was fucking mental. Its one of those games that just keeps on going. Huge attacks and defences, massive firefights, and just an all around great fps. one of the greatest i have ever played actually. idk if this happens on pc much because like i say, only having a few hours on record, but on ps4 there were a decent amount of team killers. They werent everywhere but they were numerous. In all the time i played on ps4 quite a few tried to purposely team kill me, some succeeded, but on pc it only happened once and it was an accident because he said sorry. So if you like a good firefight and you like big maps with many ways to play and contribute toward your empire, go and download it right now. start of in koltyr (the noob area, you are forced out at level 15 and cant go back) then when you are level 15 go and join everybody in one of the four massive continents and prepare to fight with and against hundreds if not thousands of people at a time. you can go to any continent at any level at any time as long as one of the opposing factions hasnt won and locked it down but it is better to start of in koltyr because it is smaller and there will be people of roughly the same level as you and you can gank some easy kills. (hossin, amerish, Esamir and indar are where the big boys play). Download, play and enjoy is all i can really say. If anyone Team kills you, i can assure you that he or she will get their comeuppance. Everybody is generally nice and play as a team really well. Every game has their knob heads, but on pc, i havent found any yet. just on ps4. You can also purchase helmets and cosmetics for vehicles and camos for your weapon or character using Daybreak cash or DBC (in game currency brought with real life money). But that is just cosmetics, The wapons and attachments are all obtainable in game with certs. (on ps4, by level 20 i had a damn good loudout, never spent a dime). And the vehicles are unlocked through levelling and you can use your spawn tokens to spawn them, the same as the max class (walking tank). These spawn tokens will recharge over time. So, there you have it, i could type more about the game but these are the basics, i dont have time to go into depth right now, i need to go play lol. Nothing bad i can think of apart from team killing noobs that i havent managed to find yet on pc but they will exist. Its a thumbs up from me and a solid 9/10 ( i would give it a 10 but the team killers drag that 1 percent down, ik its not the games fault but i refuse to lie). Like i said, havent found any on pc personally yet but i know they exist. But i gave the game a 9 because other than the team killing there is nothing bad i can think of right now. Its a really fun and addictive game and iam gonna get back into in and see what has been added since i last played. Gotta give credit where it is due and it is definitely due here."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This is a fast paced game to the fullest. One minute you'll be riding your flash, and next thing you know an Infiltrator picks you off or a tank blows you to bits.

I absolutely love it, but let me tell you one thing. NEVER run solo. This game can be overwhelming to lone wolves and new players. There are no spawn limits, so you might end up in a war zone with dozens of players, vehicles, and aircrafts swarming around you and you WILL die, no doubt about it. Yes, the graphics are a bit dated but that is ok, they need to be. There are multiple areas with over 2k players and it can bog even the best of systems down.

Pros:
- Multiple classes that stick to their purposes
- There is always action to jump into
- TONS of enemies to kill
- Buildable Platoon bases (completely destructable aswell)
- plenty of vehicles or aircrafts to ride in
- AMAZING dogfights
-Gives you a pretty good idea of what war used to look like (WW2 for instance) 

Cons:
- Sometimes to many people for some new players
- REALLY easy to die (can be considered a Pro aswell)
- Pay to Win (Better guns you otherwise couldn't get)
- Hard to keep good vantage points
- Platoon leaders tend to be easy to upset (at least from my experience)

I highly recommend this to any veteran or beginner FPS players as it works your reaction timing, distance judgement, and aim a lot more than other games.

I rate it 9.85/10 Would play again"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This is a great game i would recomend it to anyone that likes future themed fps games, it is very realistic and the way the teritory functions is very unique and i have never seen anything like it in another game, my one complaint is that certs (money) are very hard to get, but are obtainable"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,FIRE
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,Played this game for around 4 years. Can't get enough of the thrilling carnage of futuristic war!!!
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Honestly a one of a kind experience. There are no games out there to the public like this one, that set hundreds of people shooting at each other in order to take control of an area. Even though unfair to newcomers, since it puts you straight onto the battlefield where people with over 1000 hours are when you barely have 10 minutes and have no idea what you're doing, it's worth it to learn the basics and slowly get the hang of it. 
Frustrating, but fun.
11/10 would smash my computer again."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Great game that a player can get a lot of 'free' fun fragging out of.

To a new player this game can be a bit daunting and farming certs (at first) comes slow and turns many away.

To gain certs faster (at first) you need to be an engi/med, stack your ability to gain more certs by spending certs in things that help others, forget weapons at first, if you work on your repair tool, ammo giving, health/shield giving, remote repping/ammo in a sundi while acting as a passive mobile medic for people close to your vehicle etc. Maybe spend a few certs on a scope if you find time to use it.

Join a platoon/squad and actually fight with them as support and your +% bonus to certs increases giving you more certs. Joining a platoon/squad is also a great way to find big battles. Some outfits can be a bit authoritarian e.g. if you do not come and fight in the spot they are fighting in then they will kick you. Personally I think that is a bit lame, however you want certs and being in a constant battle is the best way to earn them.

It is a hard slog at first and I made it harder by buying a gun for 1k certs when I could have increased my passive cert making skills as above, now however I make so much passive certs using engi/med with little work that I have 1k certs to spend on guns etc every couple of days.

I have never spent a penny on this game, some customisations are given to the non spenders like me, such as the big christmas bow and the salty paintjob etc.

There is a lot more to say about this game, such as the huge maps and battles that push front lines back and forth for hours whilst trying to outflank the opposing force. 

It is f2p, give it a go."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,Chased a guy across a continent to stab him with a knife. 11/10
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,great game with tons of variety in ways to play. I do wish that the things you could buy in the game didn't cost so much for how old it is now though. Paying for guns is not necessary because the base guns for all frations are good compared to what could get.
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,A lot of genuine fun.
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"You like Battlefield?

You like Starwars Battlefrount (The Orignals like 1 and 2 not that new shit show one)

Then get this game 3 sided warfair with 3 factions each with their own styles, weapons and other stuff only for them thats awesome

If you really want a good Review i would suggest you watch Angry Joes Video on planetside 2 while abit dated it gives the basic impressions on the game that still holds strong allthough things have changed like a new intro with new characters thats Highly Improved

But the Number one Reason you should get this game is for the Paid Member ship Now hear me out

Not only does the Paid Membership is worth it in my Opinion but here is the good part

One Membership like 14$ amonth = all of their Games as a Premium, Which are 

Planetside 2, Dc Universe Online, Ever Quest 1 and 2 and i beliave that Day-Z Game they have, and their Currancy that you need to pay for with real money, also connected to all games, so you gotta think ""Should i pay 50$ For a bunch of points and spend it on one of their games, or spread it out to their other games, it would be nice to run around as harley Quinn (Custome wise) in their DC Online Game and have a nice gun or two in Plantside""

So yeah if your planning of  getting this game which is free get the membership It was worth it for me and i will be for you"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Hmm , still new to it but i like it ^^"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Pros:
Probably gonna like it if your a halo fan.
Decent graphics
All types of styles and gameplay from support to dogfights in the sky.
Its all free!

Cons: 1 curt every 250 xp is bullshit.

This game is awesome and I play it a lot but please make it like 5 or 10 atleast thats the only thing that bums me out. I get it you wanna make profit but hey I would still get this game if it were 20 bucks."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This game is absolute trash, unbalanced, unmoderated and full to the brim with hackers and 'lag wizards'. Don't waste your time on this cancer"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,Old game I used to play but gave up due to new games. I still like the game no matter what. However I may be f2p on this but it's still an amazing game. The war never ends and there's loads of players to fight everytime. The game is amazing still even though I left for a long time.
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Only Install If you have a High-end PC
Otherwise Don't Waste your time."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Highly recommended Free Game.
Its got some futuristic Battlefield feel to it and servers are populated (its Jan 2017).
Not much of a new idea but its really fun!"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Really unique and fun experience some days, others not so much. Fundamentally flawed in that you can't always jump in and enjoy the game."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Edited review time: After spending way more hours than what Steam says I have, by a factor of almost 10. I can finally sit down and write a review for this wonderful, beautiful, like no other game. What makes this game so special? What separates it from Battlefield, or Call Of Duty. The quick answer, a combined arms game with anywhere from 80-90 bases. Each with its own unique layout, its own bias towards Defenders and Attackers. This is a procedurally generated nonstop battle. Is there ""meta"" to playing the map? Absolutely. However, no matter how good of a strategizer you think you are, there will always be moments when you lose control. 

This game provides you the tools to be apart of a much larger group known as a Squad, which consists of 2-12 players. From there you advance upwards to a platoon that consists of 13-48 players. All following their leader's instructions and working together towards a victory. When you grow tired of running in public squads and platoons, you join an outfit. This is where I would say the core of the game is centralized. Not to say you won't have a good time being a solo player, but playing with an outfit is a far different perspective. You see these people daily, you play with them daily, eventually, you begin to trust them, and coordinate with them, you know they've got your back, and you've got there. A level of trust is formed, now the entire squad trusts one another, they excel where others would have failed.

What makes this game great is the adrenaline of capturing a base with underwhelming odds. The taste of victory when all seemed lost. Drawing from the past, I can think of a moment where my squad (10 players) assaulted a contested base between 2 other factions, each brings 24-48 players. The enemy had vehicle superiority, air superiority, and outnumbered us 8 to 1. Under normal circumstances, this would have failed miserably. Due to the level of communication, trust, and to a degree skill, we were able to hold off this entire group, right down the moment the base captured in our favor. When that last second ticked over, we were all dead but 2 of us, and the enemy was right in our faces. That moment is what resonates in my brain. The pure adrenaline of battle.

This game is better with friends, yes. However, you will gain even more on this battlefield, some will be enemies, some will fight beside you. You will gain familiarity with everyone on the server. This game is a community. There's no other way of saying it. It has outliers sure, but it is a community-driven game that stands the tests of time. 

A closing note, I started this game back when it first launched in Beta. I am, to this day still playing, and in fact, alt-tabbed out of the game right now to write this review. There is no short explanation. This game is battle on a grand scheme, where movements of platoon and squads dictate the entire flow of the battle. Where solo players can make differences. Where outfits clash in all-out war. You will die. You will die a lot. This is Planetside."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,Some seriously impressive battles happen in this game. Nothing like this available anywhere else.
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"The best PC Master Race Elitest shooter you can play. My wife tried to run it on her, pretty decently equipped, laptop and the house nearly burnt down. 

Pros:

Fun FPS combat with huge open world battles and all types of vehicles.

Cons:

Low population a lot of the time; most likely due to the hardware requirements. I have 2x SLi 1080's and even I sometimes will drop below 60fps randomly. I cant imagine how someone on a medium-tier PC would run. 

Tons of microtransactions. I don't usually care about it but I feel like everything in the game has a price attached to it, kind of brings me out of the immersion."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Yea the battles get stupid intense sometimes, but just say fuck it and equip rocket launchers for arms."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"While it is fun for a bit, it doesn't take long to realize that it is either a grind fest or something that you will need to keep putting money into."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This game is Awesome.

//Game Credentials:
-It's been around for 4 years, yet it's still going; with new content!
-And even though the Player base has shrunk somewhat, 
it still has a core dedicated player base that is Amazing!

//The Game itself:
-The graphics are still great.
-The Shear amount of content is amazing.(HUGE Maps, Weapons galore, Usermade Content for player appearance, etc.)
-The gameplay is great. (Each team's playstyle is different, for example.)

//What might drive you away:
The importance of teamwork.
While you still can have plenty of fun soloing things, it could make you feel small and insignificant in certain fights.
So I hightly recommend you find some people to play with(at least from time to time), and work with them.

//Do I recommend it?
HECK YEA!"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"First off I love and hate this game!

- The concept
- The factions 
- The possibilities
- The pew pew of lasers
- The vehicles
and so on...

But I did quit playing it because of several gamebreaking issues for me
I cant play competitive or without rage because of:
- The lag compensation 
here a really good video about the problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3fUok2AoaU

- High ping players everywhere who make the above even worse

- Server performance

- Still many fucking hackers

I was hoping for years now that they will fix it.
But all got even worse...
So good bye Planetside 2!"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"i was a peacful indian 


played this became a commi 

10/10 will play again"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Fighting TR(Terran Republic) and VS(Vanu Spandex) are quite hard battles. Although I have 51% and a 49% of kills which is quite even, the VS always seems to have the extreme hax.

This game can run fairly well with 150v150(which is the most i've seen around 4 grids, however there are usually around 800 or so players on a single planet). 

Most factions have empire-specific things, you will hear the term ESF for example(empire specific fighter). However, some factions are also shared, such as the Valkyrie, Liberator, Flash, and some more which do NOT have empire specific things. The development and hype isn't as great as it was many years back, but don't listen to the guys saying 'oh its dying' it's not. not even close to dying.

You'll be able to get into a full continent no problem(although there will be 1 continent which isnt as heavily contested usually), and updates are still coming regularly.

Last I checked, steam discussions didn't have any moderation here, so it's no good to ask questions here(lots of flaming, bait, and trolls). Try their official forums if you have questons.

You will want some pretty good specs (i5 2400 / gtx 1050 / 8g ram) for example, and that will only give you 30-50 FPS on most firefights involving 50v50+. 

No reason to not install this game, it's free. Hell, I played it for 200+ hours running at 9 fps.
Get over here and kick some ass!"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,is pretty good
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,nice game and large stage you must try once
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Its actually pretty fun. What I enjoy most about it is the drop-in drop-out gameplay style. You can join a fight whenever you want and it basically only ends when you decide to leave (or your site captures the whole continent) whereas in games like Battlefield and CoD you play till the round is over. You can spend hours in this game without ever seeing a ""Your Team has won"" screen, just racking up kills as you go along. 

Its fun, its simple and its free.

PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"It's really good for a free to play FPS, there aren't many P2P aspects but I do agree that you have to grind a lot for good stuff if your a F2P"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"I recommended this game some years ago since it was very good but they somehow managed to make it bad, it's just a generic cash-grab ""free to play"" FPS now"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Great original game, GIANT BATTLES, always fighting
Game really makes u feel like ur part OFF a real war"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This game is amazing, my favorite part was when i got my first flying vehicle, took a bit to get used to flying but eventually i got the hang of it"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"In short: Amazing fast-paced, feels like part of a war.

In Long: So, this game has all the great elements from Battlefield, massive open world frak-ton of players and tons of vehicles in both air and land, and a nice assortment of classes and different weapons for varied playstyles.
Wanna camp the enemy base and be an annoyance to the enemy? you can!
Wanna snipe from across the map? you can!
Want to jump out of your galaxy, fire your rocket at the enemy craft and enter again, mid-air? you can!
Want to land and coordinate an assault with an actual platoon? you can!
That, and i got a soft spot for Sci-fi games, something battlefield games did only once, sold me to this game
My only shame is the fact that my computer cannot run this game at the moment, this easily the first thing i'll try out in a new PC."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,OK
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Probably a repeitition of others' reviews- but hopefully it may help. Better than most FPS. Some cheaters, though quite an active, pro-merit, anti-cheat community in-game. The much overhyped Russian 3erg (Zerg) isn't as bad as claimed (played TR, VS and NC). Team-killing major problem in some factions (imbeciles and griefers). PS2 always reads the bug list and there are a number of aftermarket forums about cheats, bugs, tricks and tips. Designed more of a squad game with a number of friends than an individual. Daybreak better than most companies- not perfect- but far better than EA or Ubisoft. Grinding isn't too difficult. Everything bar cosmetics are obtainable through Certs- in game grind credits. You'll soon learn your individual playing style and dictatig how you engage make the difference, not purchased weapons or mods. Good stock weapons, many veterans able to score evry highly on them. Great community, great banter, some tards. Highly recommended."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This is the best game I can find on Steam and its the second best game behind Battlefield.

Pros:
6 classes for you to choose from depends on your play style
There are 4 huge a** maps
There is a maximum of 2000 players in one game
Nearly endless matches
Graphics are not bad
Realistic vehicle physics
Free to play! :)

Cons:
The system requirement is a little bit high for a 4-year-old game
Not enough vehicles
No destructions
Pay to win :(

Conclusion:
If you like Sci-fi FPS games and you have a decent PC, definitely try it out and I'm giving this game a 9.2 out of 10"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,i like the fps but the unlocking things are to hard
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,Granny Likes it
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Great Game, but you will need a good CPU to get good framerates, most quad-core AMD CPUs won't do."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Since most new people like me start as the NC, let me write down what your first battle will be like.

How you think it will go: You spawn in, with the sundy smoking. There are over 30 spandex cultists on the other side of hill. Equipped as a light assault, you use that jetpack to good use, taking out 5 vanu scum with c-4 and mowing the rest down with your carbine.

What really happens: You spawn in from the sundy, and see a bunch of bullets whizzing past and your screen is shaking from explosions. The vanu decided to zerg you with either 20 magriders, or a shitstorm of ESFs and liberators. Within 10 seconds, that precious van that you spawned out of is know a burning frame. You decide to take cover behind the wreckage but then a green glow engulfs it, eventually leaving no trace of evidence that anything happened. You stand there, knowing what the fuck to do, the sheer chaos overwhelming you until a harasser TK's you by running you over."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This game is a BEAST and I would highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys FPS. Just try not to get Frustated when you die... and die and die. Just keep changing it up, trying new tactics, and playstyles until you find something that fits you and go from there. The game has a learning curve but it's worth it."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,Das gut
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Scifi? check. large scale war? check. vehicles? check, this game is pretty awesome, first time I played it I was blown away, this is as close to a full scale wargame you will get, fun upgrade and customitzation system too, had hours of fun with firends on this plus its free, ive seen games demand quite an exrtortionate amount of money and not even have a tenth of what this game has to offer, highly recommend it, cant find a fault."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This game is an amazing single-player stretegy game you could also play on your ios device, and i thank the developers for the amazing graphics and quality that they brought us with this game"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Pros:
==============
-The best F2P MMOFPS

-Not pay to win. Tactics and positioning reign supreme. You can pretty much predict how a battle will end based on the terrain and numbers. All starting weapons are decent (except for vehicles).

-Fun, easy to join communities

-Air, Ground and Infantry on the same map

-Massive maps with hundreds of players, no loading zones

-So many unlocks, you will never get them all

Cons:
===============
-What's up with repairing in this game? It takes many shots to destroy vehicles and combined with powerful repair tools this leads to long, drawn out and just plain stupid standoffs where you are literally standing there and holding the mouse button down for minutes on end. You do this because it's necessary, but it's not fun for either the repairer or the shooter. I've sat with my teammates repairing our landed gunship while a fighter ran out of ammo trying to kill us.

-Long Time To Kill anything. It takes many bullets to kill infantry, similar to Halo. This leaves  you feeling unsatisfied after enemies get away from you time and time agian even after the element of surprise is on your side. This is true for vehicles as well. This also tends to make the game more ""tanky"" and what I mean by that is that whoever has the most health, be it infantry or vehicle will generally win.

-Bait and switch business model. You spend your time/money on perfecting a play-style or vehicle loadout and then the devs nerf the **** out of it, completely breaking it. They don't give refunds, so you're forced to buy something else or **** off. They do this because new players get rolled by vets that picked a play style and perfected it. In other words, it punishes long term players to keep short term players. It doesn't take a genius to predict how this will end..

-Occasional cheaters, not a big problem though

-MAJOR performance issues have plagued the game ever since the beginning. The engine is slow and buggy, and another game by the same developer failed due to this problem. That game was H1Z1.

-Updates are frequent, but every update slows the game down even more. You will need a top of the line PC at all times if you want to play this game. Right now, you need 16GB RAM, i5 or i7 with high clock speeds (3Ghz+) and a good video card. Next year you will buy a new PC or turn down your settings because this game will demand even more.

-The game needs to keep vets onboard, because they are the bread and butter of the communities. They run outfits, which make the game much more fun. Air drops aren't possible without organization. Unfortunately most have left after waves and waves of nerfs. The devs have made it clear through their actions that they don't value long term players and the game has suffered because of it.

Conclusion:
===========
It's a love hate relationship. I love it because there is nothing like it. I frequently think of reinstalling again after my last rage-uninstall. But then I don't because... I hate it because it keeps changing, sometimes backwards, sideways, but always more laggy.  I can't keep buying a new PC all the time. My PC runs 90% of the games available on Steam, and I won't drop $800 to play a free game. Also, not as obvious but a huge impact on the game is that vets have left the game a long time ago, something that makes me sad. The best times I've had were with experienced people that lead squads and used voice chat. Now there is hardly anyone because they all got burned out. Most YouTubers have stopped covering the game, aside from Wrel, a YouTuber/developer that only plays infantry, driving most of the recent nerfs to vehicles and air. I think he wants to turn this game into Call of Duty.

Still, Planetside 2 lives on because it sits uncontested in a niche. As soon as a competitor pops up without the performance issues, this game will finally be laid to rest, and not a moment too soon if you ask me."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"it done good
"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,I a good made game. It is fun and entertaining definitly for a free to play game.
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,icat play this game like
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Great Game, but my system cant handle it. Too much lag. But you should get it and play. Its Good."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"literaly the best ftp fps on steam, its all good... you stop playing anything else on steam for awhile. you forget about it. then you remember that you have the game and it starts all over again."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"O SHIT WADDUP
"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Let's start off with, I both hate this game but I love it and cant stop playing it. This game is casically a mix between halo, cod, battlefield, wolfinstien, and a little hint of starcraft. There are three factions: the Terran Rupublic(TR), which is the red team use balistics with all weapons and are generally the bad guys, use balistic weapons and are most likely to swarm one single area with a giant army. The New Conglamorate(NC) is the blue team, basically the good guys and obviously inspired by our own US as i like to call them the space america, normally fights the TR on every map in large numbers on one area, usually stalwart defenders. Then last everyones favorite the Vanu Soverieghnty(VS), the purple team is the only faction who use only laser weapons and are the team that will have small skirmishes with each faction or infiltrating undefended territory and winning the game because the other two are busy fighting each other.

Pros & Cons:
Pros:
-2000 player max per map
-Capablility to relocate to most bases via redeploy or join combat, the maps are big so this is a plus
-Multiple classes and armor and vehicles to spruce the gameplay and give roles to people
-Has a squad system that rewards players with larger xp for playing with other people
-Has base building aspect, where an individual can mine resources to build a small outpost and generate a victory point
-A small small map dedicated to new players is available to build skills call koltyr
-It's free
-Directives give you goals to achieve to unlock items and gain a few certificates and xp

Cons:
-Certificates, the in game money is difficult to earn and most items are 1000 certs to buy
-Has a pay to win option that many seem to delve into
-The NC has an unfair advantage in starting weapons that have a better damage output
-The Vanu seem to be mostly played by p2w players or hackers
-You have to be ok with dying all the time, because you will die literally all the time, sometimes as soon as your spawned
-The devolopers no longer own the game and its new dictators only care enough for it to reciebe the money you put into it. Its 5 years old so dont expect any big updates anymore
-It's boring to play this game for any longer than an hour by yourself, you have to play it with a friend or two or you will hate this game. This is a con because that means without friends this game has no leverage of its own
-There is some lore to the game, but nothing besides what little they give you at the character creation screen. After that you have nothing else to learn and obsese about

My advice is to play this game only with 1 to 2 friends and try to have fun, but remember that dying is a part of the game"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"While the basic workings are about what you'd expect from a free-to-play game (a few paid elements, not the greatest game mechanics), the sheer scale of the game is unmatched by any FPS, free or not. The futuristic feel is fun but somewhat lacking in depth, and the learning curve (and the lag!) is pretty steep anywhere but the starting continent. It's a fun way to blow a couple hours now and then, but it's not something a casual gamer should expect to spend hundreds of hours on.

Overall not the best shooter I've ever played, but hey, did it cost you anything?"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,a real time strategy first person shooter game...you can either follow orders to win or you give the orders to win. extremely fun. really really massive. I mean at times we have 100+ people in one area that you have an all out gunfight with bullets and explosions.
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"The greatest MMO-Strategic-Action-Adventure game... in the world -
and we're stuck with Tcp/ip and ADSL-type connections from 90% of the gamers populating its servers; so you're either the sender or the receiver of 2.5sec of delay telling you whether you did something or you didn't do something before the other person did something or you thought they didn't so something and in some kind of quantum way, both of you receiving the answer at the same time with a positive and negative two-way split.

How do you think this type of MMO game is possible with Tcp/ip and non-Intel Nics.

Planetside 2 is an unfortunate victim of technology and a company that got tired of PC gamers living in the past.

Realm of the Mad God Exalt,Massively%20Multiplayer,200210,"Man where do I even start with this game.. I started like 12867 years ago when it came out on Kongregate and it was awesome! Wild Shadow did everything perfect with this game.  Then Kabam bought them out and turned it into more of a pay to win.  Kabam did some good, but mostly bad.  They owned Realm for a long time, but very recently a company called DECA bought it from Kabam.  DECA has been incredible in my opinion.  They have released more updates in two months than Kabam did in 5 years.  New things and skins and map changes, it's exactly whatneeded to happen.  So, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it right now.  About 6 months ago I would've said not to bother.  I just hope DECA keeps with it"
Realm of the Mad God Exalt,Massively%20Multiplayer,200210,"[h1]Even though this game is simple and decent fun, it's pretty dull and repetitive once you play it for a while.

 However; in recent updates, the controls are now TERRIBLE, and are barely even responsive, (either that, or it's my crap internet, from ""AT&T"") and that PISSED me off, into a meaningful RAGE QUIT, only without anger, involved! I hope they fix the controls.

 The gameplay however, it isn't HORRIBLE, and the game itself, has a GREAT basic idea, with a simplified action MMORPG, with a permadeath based system!

 Will I ever reccomend this? If they ever fix the controls, then the answer is ""yes""; otherwise, if it's NOT the game itself, but a crappy wi-fi connection, then I should HIGHLY suggest sticking with some of the BEST video games, that don't USE online gameplay. Like ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"", or even ""Mighty No. 9"".

 In my honest critique, ""Mighty No. 9"" was ONLY ""hated"" by fans, because they were expecting WAY too much, for a ""Mega Man"" alternative. But however; believe it or not, I played it, and it ACTUALLY isn't that bad! For $20 or less, it's actually a good deal! And if you LIKE the classic ""Mega Man"" series, you should POSSIBLY like ""Mighty No 9."", as well! (Haters gonna hate; even if you don't like it, at least it's better, than those greedily made social games, such as ""FarmVille""!)"

Realm of the Mad God Exalt,Massively%20Multiplayer,200210,"You die way too easily, so much as getting your fingers twisted will kill you. You aren't given enough storage space without spending a ridiculous amount of money on in game currency as well. This game feels like a cheap trap for kids with their parents credit cards. It'd be fun if it wasn't so hard to get decent gear and collect things but the game really isn't. No, you either get really good at running around and dodging and never make a mistake or you die and lose everything. You only get eight inventory slots in your storage to try and keep items for when you do but that's not even close to enough to have fun. And am I going to pay $10 USD for one more of those eight slot chests in a game like this? Hell no, I can buy a better game or an older game that's more fun for that."

Realm of the Mad God Exalt,Massively%20Multiplayer,200210,"Update 2/20/17
I'd never thought I would come back to this game again. Kabam sold ROTMG to Deca, and it seems the new company is making the game a whole lot better. I'll try to play it again, but who knows? I left this type of game to try others.

Kabam, fix what you're doing, you're letting some of the best games die on pc!!!
I used to play this game on the kongerate when wild shadows owned the game, however simce my pc broke, I didn't come back for a while. Fast foward to today, where I see the game on steam, and I decided to give it a run. First thing I see, ads all over the place, and posters begging you to buy stuff you didn't need. Not Good. When I entered a server, four words total: Bots. There was bots spamming the chat, and back then the Nexus, there was people being cooperative. Nowadays, there are bots and scammers trying to get your items for free. I saw that players could also buy WC tops,a d that wasn;t so good. 3 bucks for a cosmic, not bad, but thet makes the game economy go downhill. 
All in all, Kabam fix what you did, or else I would not come back for years. You even failed to revive all the dead from the Nexus spawning! There are deaths from the kills of O2 and others in the Nexus that you haven't revived! FIX THIS GAME BACK TO WHAT IT WAS FORMERLY WAS!"
Realm of the Mad God Exalt,Massively%20Multiplayer,200210,"very laggy in need of a bugfix
"
Realm of the Mad God Exalt,Massively%20Multiplayer,200210,"I've played this game on browser and flash player for all of my career in it, so hear me out despite Steam's hours on record.

First off, I'd like to note that this game recently has been moved into the control of a new developer, and they are taking great strides in terms of communication with the community, providing content, etc. With that aside, let's get to the game stuff.

I don't want to boil Realm of The Mad God down to pros and cons. Simply because, as experience has taught me, this game is all about personal taste. [b]Give it a try, and give it an extended chance before laying down judgement[/b]

Some cons [u] to get out of the way[/u]: This game will scare away the average casual gamer on first impression very easily. Your characters permanently die, you are bombarded by bullet hell-esque shots from enemies, and the game has quite a bit of a steep learning curve.
[b]In argument of its defense[/b] the game can feel extremely rewarding for the effort put into it. If you're not into that corny excuse, I'd like to point out that [i]even though it is perma death[/i] there are a few things you keep. Your vault(your storage, basically) keeps everything in it through death, you do not lose pets, and you acquire the in game currency called [b]fame[/b]. Fame is used to [b]level up your pets[/b] which is your best friend if you don't consider yourself ""good"" at the game. [b][i]Your deaths are not pointless, and are not setting you behind. They are moving you forward.[/i][/b]

The gameplay and visuals are charmingly simple. There's no unnecessary flair, and everything is clear to understand(sometimes it get cluttered with lots of people, but there are options in game to deal with this). 

Some people will see the gold currency(and not the fame currency) and assume all of the game's currency is microtransaction based. [b]This is a horrid misconception.[/b] There is no npc based currency, and the market is entirely a player run barter system. Microtransactions on in-game equipment are all items you can get for free by playing the game, and account upgrades/character fashion.

The gameplay is what you would expect from a ""bullet hell mmorpg"". There are patterned shots that you need to learn how to dodge, and you get progression in the form of levels and equipment. Learning the patterns of enemies can be gruelling at first, but it gets more and more fun as you learn and get better.

I absolutely love this game, and I honestly wish I had played on steam so I could keep track and show how many hours I've really spent on it. I would recommend you GIVE IT A CHANCE, and advise you to look up at least some basic hints and tips before getting angry over some of the small things lots of people seem to get angry about.

Now before it seems like I've turned this game into a holy grail, I need to point out two of the game's biggest flaws, just to be fair.

1) The community
This is a bit of a questionable flaw. I have met very nice people and there [i]are very nice people[/i] in game. However, if you pay attention to the public chat and focus in on it, alot of the majority vocalization is that of very terrible, ill mannered, children(I hate to put it this way). People telling eachother ""kys"", racist remarks, calling each other noobs. A lot of the time I have to [i]heavily advise[/i] to [u]never ask for free items[/u]. This makes people literally explode with uncontrollable teen rage, and you're better off waiting for someone to drop an item or offer it to you if you need help. [b][u]On the bright side[/u][/b], thankfully blocking terrible people is as easy as right clicking their comment in chat and clicking ""ignore"".

2) There are impossibly rare items
Impossible is an exaggeration, but this should get the point across. The game is permadeath, and there are items that are untradeable AND rare enough that people who have been playing this game for years have either:
a) never obtained them
b) only have gotten a couple of them.
You die with it? Too bad.
This is the biggest turn off for me as a player, and alot of people will feel disgusted to know this when they find out, so I'm letting you know now.
Again, [u]on the bright side[/u] the new developers have stated that they are looking into a way of making these more accessible while attempting to appease to the whiny individuals that would complain about such a change, and have already hosted a multitude of in game events that increase your likelihood of finding one.

[b]Overall Conclusive Rating:[/b] Gr8/8, if you can push yourself past the initial learning curve, and the subjectively glaring cons"
Realm of the Mad God Exalt,Massively%20Multiplayer,200210,"I've spent more money on an 8 bit game than I have on literally any other game please help me.
also this is a good game do recommend

Edit: For the sake of being 500 hours in I'm gonna rewrite this as an actual review. This game is one of my favorites to waste time on, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS a form of progression, whether that be items or fame or trying to earn new skins, there is always a goal to accomplish. It can quickly go from a quick time wasting game, to a full fledged dedication, which is what I love about the game, the fact that it can appeal to more than one group of players. Pets and microtrasactions have plagued the game for a while, but that doesn't change the fact that you yourself do not have to pay for anything. Sure, it helps (as of writing this I have a combined total of like $100 spent on here), but I didn't buy a character slot till I got my first 4/8 (half maxed) character, and I did just fine with one slot. 
Do I reccomend?
Absolutely"

Realm of the Mad God Exalt,Massively%20Multiplayer,200210,great game i personally like its 8-bit style that really brings back old school games
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,This game announced at 2013. Now I'm fat and bald but thank god finally able to play this masterpiece.
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn't want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.

The dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.

People who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won't replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don't use the boxes.

PvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules ""No healing potions, no ultimates"" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it's my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can't do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I'll leave it as ""I'm new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being"".

Addressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don't feel it's a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That's pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don't have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it's not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.

Classes. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won't be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren't available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I'm not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn't' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.

So to wrap it up, as someone who went in with 0 expectation, and 0 knowledge of the game, I really enjoyed it. I think the market is in serious need of a new MMO format, and this is a game I will gamble on."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"I've been in a gaming slump for a while, and this has absolutely got my interest.

Diablo style combat in an MMO with all the collecting etc. 

I've logged a... large amount of hours in Diablo 3. The combat in that is smooth, and Lost Ark feels similar in that the combat just feels great. The controls are a little different, but after a couple of hours it was absolutely fine.

I've only experienced a few hours, but I can tell that this is a game I can finally look forward to and spend time with due to the activities on offer.

Refunded so I can get a higher founder tier."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Holy shit please just release it, after playing the alpha im addicted"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,K-pop Diablo with better multiplayer and endgame.
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Don't listen to anyone telling you this game is p2w, they have no clue what they're talking about.

Lost Ark Online an incredibly polished MMORPG, filled to the brim with content. 
Every single class feels extremely unique and fun to play. You've got several ways to play a class, you can reset your skill points for free at any time to adjust your build to the content too.
No holy trinity here, so don't be afraid of needing to play a specific class to feel wanted in endgame content. 

The world is huge, HUGE.
You start the game on one continent, then once you're done with the very cool story with superb cutscenes, of which the quality only get better through the story, you get to sail on a ship and can choose to do sea activities or go to other continents to continue the main sceario quest or all the islands out there to find things like collectibles, extra skill points...
The leveling experience is a wonderful ride. The dungeons are fun, and quite a few are straight up SPECTACULAR. 

It's graphically one of the most impressive MMORPGs out there. It looks BEAUTIFUL, almost every area is just so pleasing in its own way. From fae lands, to wuxia towns, to literally Midgar from Final Fantasy 7, there's a huge amount of diversity in aesthetics between the continents and it's great.

I just love this game a lot overall. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"got to level 60 on the Korean Ver, and i only speak and read English, this just tells you how good this game really is, This game takes Diablo 3 to a whole new level, the Combat in this game is Next level, The spells and Skills you use in this game feel Great, you can feel the power behind every spell or swing of your sword, 

Diablo 4 should be scared of this game."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Let's start by opening with: it isn't P2W - for those that have played in other versions (myself included) monetisation is not something to be concerned about.

With perfectly equalised and balanced arena PvP, and even a number of equalised raids as well (with rank boards for clears), this is a great game for both competitive PvPers and PvErs alike.

There are viable progression paths for all sorts of people, be they casual or hardcore, F2P or whale, or any combination.

The game is incredibly fun and will definitely scratch the itch that many of us have been having for a proper, high-quality AAA MMORPG - I've been enjoying this casually in other regions and plan to make it my main game once its out in the West, because it definitely has the appeal to keep me hooked long-term.

...

Now, if you're interested in a little history:

MMORPGs have not been doing too hot lately - from the golden age of the early 2010s where a new big MMO was coming to ""dethrone WoW"" every other week, the genre has been starved as MOBAs and Battle Royales took the mainstream spot.

With limited releases and an aging genre, there just isn't much of anything fresh coming along - expansions for other, older MMOs can seem more appealing than betting on new indie releases.

With this context, Lost Ark comes at the greatest possible time. Teased way back in GSTAR 2014 - when our MMO fever was at its peak - this strange yet uniquely appealing Diablo-esque looking MMO was hyped beyond belief.

Being in development hell for years, it wasn't until December 2018 (almost 2019) that it saw its full release in Korea. With a rocky journey, it faced multiple revamps and region releases, trying to find its own identity.

Yet now, it has been the most played MMORPG in Korea for months on end (according to http://gametrics.com/) - and it is in this polished state that we are getting Lost Ark in the West.

And gosh, polished it is! 

Classes are varied with unique identities (both figuratively and literally, given the identity system), there is all sorts of content - from competitive PvP and raiding to exploration and lifeskilling - as well as incredibly entertaining dungeons and core system mechanics.

The developers have been on a warpath to deliver new content, releasing multiple endgame raids in short periods of time and constantly adjusting balancing to fine tune class performance. The game is most definitely loved, not just by players, but by its own developers.

It doesn't stop at the gameplay either. A beautiful score and incredible graphics, you can lose yourself in playing the multiple dungeons and raids. Whether doing little island sidequests or experiencing the cutscenes in the main questline, there is a real sense of awe as you go through the content this game has to offer.

It is an MMORPG - you'll do the old school running through quests, levelling up, grouping up with people for raids and gearing up your characters. Sometimes though, that's exactly the experience you want. Lost Ark Online provides just that, but with polish.

I have been playing this game casually for the past 2 years - now that it is coming to the West I plan to make this my main game with no hesitation.

Great game, probably one of the best MMOs out there and - as a matter of fact (according to ratings) - the best KRMMO out there currently."

It is like a Diablo, but with 8 - 16 character abilities, plus usable combat items with fun little stats like boost movement by 12% for 10 seconds. Parkour sequences, chases, quest decision points that change their outcomes. Support / DPS / Crowd Control metas. But, it is also an MMO with packed cities and random encounters with players out in the world. 

Amazon Games did well to recognize this game and get it out to the west. I haven't tried PvP yet, but I can see the Battlerite / LoL / Dota styled potential to it. I have no doubt this game will be huge here from my short time in it so far."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"I would like to write a long boring review, but I'm too busy going back to play this masterpiece."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Had been looking at this game since it released in Korean and am so excited that it's finally releasing in NA. After playing the technical alpha, I'm hooked! The combat is fun and engaging. While very similar to the Diablo games, the combat in this game also features chain attacks or combos (depending on the class you're playing). The story is compelling enough to keep your interest (although I powered through it to avoid spoiling anything major for the full release) and the environments are beautiful and interesting.

Although the combat is extremely fun, the game also features many different professions to level up and grind on. Whether its fishing, hunting, mining minerals or cutting down trees, Lost Ark will have something to hold your interest when you don't feel like killing anything. 

A few things worth mentioning, each class featured in the game is gender locked. This means that if you would like to play a Warrior, for example, you will be forced to create a male character. While this wasn't an issue for me, it might be a turn off for players who would like to create their own character without restraints. In addition, it is worth noting that PvP content is only available at lvl 50. While my initial levelling experience was slow, it did seem to pick up a little after the first few levels. This could be because I was having so much fun playing the game but, I know some people might want to jump into the game and start fighting other player. You'll need to do a bit of leg work first.

Although there's a lot more to cover, all in all I definitely recommend this game to any Diablo or Path of Exile fans who are looking for a asymmetric MMO. I've definitely been enjoying it and can't wait for the beta so I can hop back in. I requested a refund for my Silver Founder's Pack so that I can upgrade to the Platinum."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Game is so easy to get into and the combat is AMAZING. 10/10 game
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"9/10 equalized gear pvp arenas. 
Great combat."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"I locked my family in the basement to have more free time for this.

Full release now, please. They're starving and their cries for help make me angry."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"I believe this game is excessively and undeservedly hyped only because there hasn't been a good MMO-ARPG in a long time and Lost Ark looks like a good game to satisfy that niche.

How many of you have actually played this game?

I started playing since day 1 of official KR release. Leveled up Summoner and Devil Hunter to max level. Hit 500 ilevel on Devil Hunter. I've since uninstalled this game.

This has game 3 major flaws.

Extremely poor class balancing.

No battle logs/meter/dps meter/whatever you wanna call it. Something to check your own performance and that of your party members.

No sense of progress from upgrading your gear. Everything is about ilevel.
 
Smilegate doesn't want to release dps meter because they want to protect ""casuals"". Ok that's fine but Smilegate did a very poor job preventing all the negative side-effects of not having meters. Doing raids is extremely frustrating when you have one or two bad players in your party. And trust me, it happens a lot in higher tier raids. The funny thing is you can't even tell if you are doing good yourself. There's no way to figure out what is wrong with your party and the reason for failing.

So this leads to two things:

Heavy reliance on expensive consumables. They are NOT needed at all for a competent party but they are 100% necessary in most parties to compensate for the poor survival and dps skills of your party members.

Class filtering. Instead of being judged by your skill and performance, people are judged by the class they play. Even though there is no dps meter, the KR Lost Ark communities have their list of strong classes and weak classes. The strong classes have monumentally easier time finding raid parties while the weak classes get turned down from raid parties. The crazy thing is, the list changes constantly since there really is no hard data and it's based mostly on ""perception"" and boss kill videos. One week, Berserker is deemed the strongest class and the next week it's considered weak. It's really hilarious.

So a lowly skilled player who is playing a ""strong"" class gets into raids much easier than a highly skilled player who is playing a ""weak"" class even though it's highly likely that the skilled player will offer a much better performance(survival and damage wise) to the party. And there is no way to prove this because there is no dps meter or logs.

You can't blame the community for this. People don't want to waste time and gold failing raids for hours. So they have to come up with a way to ensure some degree of success, and the only way to do that currently is by stacking the party with strong classes. You are judged by the class you play, not by your skill.

And then there is the ilevel. Nothing matters about your gear other than your ilevel. Since there is no way to measure dps or quantify the benefits of set effects, runes, or glyphs, everyone's sole focus is increasing their ilevel. You are not motivated to min/max your gear by rerolling stats and putting in the best runes because you will replace your gear as soon as you get something with higher ilevel from your next dungeon or raid. The itemization system is very 1-dimensional and it's worsened by the fact that there is no sense of progress in upgrading your gear since there is no way to objectively measure how much more damage you are doing.



Ok enough of wall of text. In my honest opinon, this game is no where near as good as it was hyped up to be, and it will most likely fail in NA and EU if Smilegate doesn't make drastic changes to the itemization and add some sort of performance meter or logs."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"absolutely mind blowing. never have i thought id play a game that feels like a mixture of diablo, dark souls and a teeny hint of moba. for the alpha itself the only thing I've encountered as awkward is translations and dialogue. granted I've only played for 3 hours split between 3 characters. overall the Alpha was a solid 9/10 for me."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Super fun, enjoyable pvp and end game dungeons/raids"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"First of all, let me tell ya straight to your face, what a friggin Juggernaut this game is!
The finest form of an AAA production.

-Massive entertaining stoyline with sick cinematics
-Great Soundtrack with an epic score and nice (english) voice acting
-Buttery smooth combat with nice fx and superb animations
-Fair and balanced PvP. The cash shop doesn't matter here
-Good optimization. The game runs fairly nice, even on older rigs
-Huge content that lasts for 2 lifetimes

The top of the food chain MMO a-rpg!!

Diablo who? :D"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,this is it
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,i love this game i waited years to play this!
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,All i can say is that it is about time for this masterpiece to finally come to the west in a official capacity.
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Its NDA lmao
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"I played the alpha upto level 41. I Havent played many mmos long term in quite a while, this one has the feel of old mmos like ragnarok online, it has the right amount of hack and slash to quest. For the story mode you can 100% solo it and make decent progress without feeling overwelmed or that the game is too easy.

They have a bit to go on localization but overall in its alpha state was better than some ready to launch games."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Showed this game to my friends back in high school. Happy to say that we can finally play it while finishing university!
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"It is a just good game and finally in our region and after waiting for almost 6 years without combining how to play on the Ru server I am really happy with what is available so far and with the possibility to play right now. 
It was worth waiting this time for this game ^^"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Goty but in 2018
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,finally
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Was waiting since long time for this game and I’m not disappointed it’s a great game. In my opinion it’s ready to release, I had no bugs only few times connection problems. I hope they release it earlier then planed can’t wait =)"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"This game is pretty sweet.  If you enjoy playing Diablo, Path of Exile, Last Epoch or the old Wizards of the Coast games, this is right up your alley."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Release it
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Loved the game, played through the alpha to end game with a group of friends and we had a blast. Mobbing reminded me of poe and cabal but game was optimized and barely lagged. Will definitely be playing the game when it releases. Rip my guild, CFood"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,game's sex
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"I enjoy Lost Ark I've always wanted a MMO with combat like Diablo & Path of Exile. Make no mistake while this has top down ARPG combat it is a MMO at heart so just be aware, I think its great. The game has high production value and even now being a couple years old and a MMO the graphical presentation is really great from set piece story quest to character models and weapon/armor. If you have always wanted a expansive ARPG with guilds and ship sailing and world bosses, co-op dungeons that Lost Ark will worth a look for you and on release it is F2P though like any other F2P game it has in store cash items (gotta keep the lights on servers up and new content flowing) so its a fact of life. Grab your massive sword or wand and join us out there cheers!"

Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,I am surprised just how good this game is I am enjoying this very much the graphics are great and so is the story. The combat is fluid and fun. I hope this comes out sooner rather than later.
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,The MMO we have been waiting for all these years!
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Holy moly this game is sick. the combat reminds me of a more hack and slash diablo 3, but everything else really shines as an mmo not just an arpg. The combat is very fast paced and fun, and the fact that you can have like 16 abilities makes it feel a lot cooler. The class selection and amount of abilities is insane, and looking at the size of the world map, it seems you wont get bored for a very long time."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Better than Diablo
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"It's good as it seems on the trailers.
It's not the MMo we are used to see.
It's not the Hack&Slash we are used to see.
It's a very well done mix of both."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Very good. Excited for full release!
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"This game is almost exactly what I want from an mmo. My only complaint (after the alpha) is the sub-par cutscenes and voice acting, if you're looking for a story-rich game this might not be for you."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Got family?
Got friends? Not anymore you don't."

Combat is more fun than any arpg or MMO I have ever played.

I'm really excited for this now.

EDIT
If Any Devs are reading this please get some dates announced so I can book time of to session this thing."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,I'm in love with this game...
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Most satisfying controls I've played with in any action MMO. Looks great, feels great.

pros: 
- gorgeous visuals and animations
- responsive controls, movement, and camera
- minimal load times when moving between maps/regions
- is a true MMO with all types of multiplayer content
- well-designed tutorials and user interfaces

cons: 
- Characters are gender-locked, which means you may not find the exact appearance and playstyle you've always dreamed of role-playing among the 15~20 characters in Lost Ark as of now.
- Very few animations can be cancelled, which may disappoint players coming from fighting game or MOBA genres.
- Writing may seem a bit cliché, but the cinematic directing more than makes up for it."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,This game is fucking fire and it does live for the hype. Dont miss out on it.
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"I mean what are we even talking about here. Everyone and their mothers wanted to play this game since it was first announced. We've all tried the Korean and Russian versions and finally, it is here.
Highly recommend this masterpiece. This is what Diablo should've been.
If Amazon does not become greedy and excludes P2W;which doesnt exist to begin with, this is going to
occupy ALOT of people when it comes out hopefully in October"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"BRUH this game is really fun!! It's a MOBA game and it kind of feels like playing league but with quests and freedom. I loveeee this game so much, the character customizations and graphics are great. Runs pretty smooth and it's just so much fun. Definitely get it. Some aspects of the game will feel like BDO and WoW combined."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Best MMO Out period
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Coming from Blade and soul and Tera back in the day, this has everything I love about both without the drawbacks of either.

Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Been waiting for 2 years after trying out RU server, finally it came out on EU. Awesome game."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,It is like World of Warcraft and Mu Online had a baby during their primes. I could easily waste my life away playing this.
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,This game's fun as hell
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"I have played only a little bit of it yet and the first thought that hit me is that Lost Ark is a trimmed down Blade and Soul game version for isometric RPG lovers. It is not bad. I would rate it as Positive, but not overwhelmingly. If you liked/like BnS, you will probably like this too."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,More Fun than Path of Exile so far...
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Zug Zug
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,So far the game has great english text and speech. I'm not sure if end game will be more p2w but I can say just from a time/worth/fun aspect from leveling up to finishing the story....it's simply amazing and well polished. Well worth any price tag.
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Been waiting for five bloody years, it was worth it."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,take my money 💰
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Quite fun.

Highly recommend!!"

Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Now i realise why my wife wants to adopt from Korea. 👍 Brilliantly addictive.
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Waiting many year for this !!!!
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Yes please. Release ASAP!
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"NOT PAY TO WIN!!!  NOT PAY TO WIN!!!  NOT PAY TO WIN!!! 

If you groom the forums, you will find a lot of baby whiners complaining about various arguments as to why the game is Pay to Win, yet most have never experienced the game or are basing opinions on Season 1 instead of Season 2 in which the game was overhauled, which is the version NA will be releasing on. If you consider this game to be Pay to Win then you must consider WoW to be Pay to Win with the option of buying gold/character boosting. Dungeons in Lost Ark are gated by Gear Score however the gear required to run dungeons is easily obtainable by being a free player.  Below are some commonly asked questions, starting with the big one.. 

What do Korean players think of the ""P2W""?
-Waste of money because it's not worth it as most of the stuff can be easily farmed and pointless since you will be at the top alone and might skip some fun gameplay contents. There is not incentive in being the first to clear PvE content, as you will be at the top, alone without anyone caring. 

Below are quote from saintone:
Be aware that due to the pacing of content updates, if you P2W to rush to +15 or higher, you’re basically waiting idly for the next content to come out while F2P players catch up.

If I play Path of Exile or Diablo will I like Lost Ark?
- The only similarities between the two is the quarter-view isometric camera angle. Outside of that, they are completely incomparable.

Is this a holy trinity game? Are there tanks and healers?
- Lost Ark is not a holy trinity. Everyone is a DPS. The Warlord is a fraud. And Bards are mainly just there to be cute and shield you.

Are there character boosts? Can I skip the main story?
-Initially, there are no character boosts. But the game is designed so that they introduce character boosts to level 50 that also serve as story skips later on down the line.

Are there loot crates?
- It's not really loot crates but it might have been blown out of proportion by some people who thinks it's straight up loot crates. In Lost ark, there are purple grade customs, you can basically dismantle this into materials a lot of RNG to get Legendary. (More experience Lost Ark players might be able to explain this better than me)


TLDR - Check out ""Sywo"" a youtuber who is purely dedicated to Lost Ark content and has been for quite a while in all regions. He is one of the most informative content creators and has videos on how the game is not ""Pay to Win""."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,Feels fun for  the  first few hours.

CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,"pros: its a decent game to mindlessly slide around, it has a fair bit of vehicles to modify, the handling is alright and its easy to get into, 

cons: the scoring system seems to lean alot towards insane angles and speed more than precision driving and smooth transitions and lines, the engine sounds are very bland, the global chat is like a call of duty voice chat lobby and there seem to be alot of very angry and or just vulgar people spamming there at every hours of the day,

all and all it kinda feels like a half baked game, but i wouldnt recommend it mainly for the reason that it gets stale fairly quick and if ur hoping to just relax and slide around and maybe chat to people in there u are going to have wade thru alot of very angry and immature people"
CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,JDM VIBE
CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,the life goes sideway ^.<)
CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,"This review is based on my personal experience with the game.

If you only want a decent drifting platform, the devs got a good one.

They also only censored swear words and other terms like 'fart' but all racial slurs and hate speech terms are uncensored and (including gta 5) this is the most toxic online community I have ever come across.  Most nights has about 400 active gamers online between servers and the open chat.  I had over 93 on block for telling anyone who wasn't a white heterosexual to kill themselves every single time I was in there, which I was on every night but two days in over a 3 week span. I was telling my friend about it and he told me his son had to stop playing the game because of suicidal thoughts from the chat on it, because he is gay. 

I reached out to the devs, like others have, about this and they just ignore or mute you. I have nothing go on why they don't care about any of that, but after beating the game in 3 days, and finding it quite boring beyond the 20 tracks or so they give you (including a reverse run for each track, talk about lazy mappers, but whatever, mods can help that out I guess).

They did three updates I think since I played the game. They have actually ruined the 5 cars I enjoyed using so there's legitimately nothing here for me, now.

I just wanted to come on here and warn all about how toxic and hateful this particular niche community is.  

And to think I was so excited about Car X Street, but I won't be going near this studio after seeing their fans. It even brought up a very important discussion for the studio I'm currently a writer for, and how we're going to implement reprimands for people attempting to send hate speech that will block communications every time for a time limit when they attempt, not even letting it through.  It's not hard to do.  It just takes effort and 'want' and I can't see any proof these Devs want anything but more toxicity. 

'happy' drifting.

If you have any mental health concerns, or the person you're gifting this to has them...  Don't.

You could very well be doing them a disservice"

CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,It should be shocking how many hours i have considering the online wont work for me 0.0
CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,"I play with Dualsense PS5 controller.

Carx DRO is a fine drift driving game where you can see how good you are at drifting.
I would describe this game as more arcadey than a sim, and that's okay for this type of game.
It is very fun to have long drift chains, tune and customize your cars, and take them to track to drift.

Single player are options are:

High score on a track,
Tandems
Time attack
Practice

Earning money by completing maps with a high score allows you to purchase new cars and customization options.

Multiplayer is where it really shines. The customization allows you to see how other people personalize their cars and you can share your personality as well. Tandem drifting or line drifting with other players around the map is quite fun as well.

You can join lobbies with DLC maps even if you do not own the dlc.

There is a season pass and ""ultimate"" edition. Season pass includes all past present and future dlc, while the ultimate edition removes the money part of the game by giving you access to every car and customization option. 

Summary:
Very fun relaxing and chill drift game that can be played with KBM, Controller, or wheel. I bought the game on sale and do not regret it."

Coming from Froza to this game was hard. Took me legit 20 hours ingame time to get used to the joystick and turning, others may get  it down faster. BUT WORTH IT IMO, cant tell you how much fun i have had since i got this game and became better over timer.  

I would recommend this game 110% if u are a car guy and or like tuning, drifting and tandeming."

I'm so glad I've purchased this game finally and it is an absolute win. Graphics are good for a drift game with no story. Customization is hard but you can design anything you want. It's pretty much complex and you might need to see a tutorial for it, also you have to get good tunes for your car to drift easily without any trouble like spinning out etc. Absolute god level game!"

CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,"i'm a big fan of racing games and with that being said i like all types of racing games as well from life like racing to off the wall stunt track racing. I found this game to be fun but also a challenging because each track has its own level of difficulty. Hitting turns at the right angle to set yourself up for the next turn and not hit the wall is hard enough but as you test out each car, they all have their own style of drifting you have to master. It also lets you adjust a lot of the cars suspension system to fit the way you like to drift."

Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Let me tell an amazing story about what trove what once was compared to what trove is now.

EDIT3: HERE IS A COUNTUP FOR THE TIME THE DEVELOPERS STILL HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO THIS REVIEW.
https://www.tickcounter.com/countup/22961/time-since-no-developer-reponse-for-my-top-review-on-trove-with-various-complaints

[h1]What was:[/h1]
An amazing sandbox/RPG style game that existed when I was in 8th grade(around 2 years ago). I would log in with one of my best friends and play, level, and build. Classes cost in game currency, so it only took around ~2 months for me of playing an hour a day to obtain every single class. Leveling was not difficult, mounts were not hard to get, and reaching max level was only a matter of time and not that far from people who spent money on this game. Market was somewhat balanced, item mall did not give too many OP items, and it was possible to see people reach max level without spending a single cent. Streamers were nice, loved the game(I was part of a streamer's guild and watched 20+ hours of his stream), and had massive giveaways that simply made every minute of this game fun to play. Grinding was not that annoying since drop rates were not unreasonable, and crafting materials were not so difficult to find or buy from others. When I would happen to get bored(very rarely), it would be a 'why not' to just go ahead and play some soccer from a stadium one of the guild members created. Toxicity and scammers were uncommon, since many people were flourishing and being quite successful both economically and emotionally. I was mastery 60/100 at that time after only about ~150 hours(before steam release obviously).
[h1]After Steam Release:[/h1]
Trove created a ""Patron Pass"", basically a premium subscription based system that when activated, gave double drop rate, double exp, and multiple other benefits. This seemed miniscule at first, since not only was this given out two weeks for free, the buffs do not look that overpowered at first. However, at a deeper glance, trove seemed to slowly lower drop rates for rare items, and people would have to rely on Patron benefits to simply live like the old life of the f2p player BEFORE the steam release. However, this by itself was not bad, since trove gained more populrity, Trion struggeld to keep servers up. Level cap increased to 200. I only pushed myself for another 40-50 hours to make myself readch around level 90/200. Many systems were added to late game characters that seemed to break the economy, as late game players were the ones with 99% of the money. Imagine the game's economy going into a elitist form of economy, that's how it became. Materials became 20x more expensive(Going from 1 flux to 20) and some items were downright impossible to afford. I realized even though I spend more than 150 hours on this game before steam release, I was no poorer than a brand new player who spent 10 hours after steam realease.
[h1]After the ""Cancer Patch"":[/h1]
This. This is the patch that ruined the game. Trion made it so classes could no longer be purchased with in game currency.  Trion claimed that this was to increase the variety among the classes and make people feel more individualized. However, nothing was actually done TO the classes to make them feel more different. In fact, besides a few unnoticable buffs/nerfs, classes remained virtually the same, so Trion failed to communicate that to the people. Although I had every single class(they released a class later that I obviously cannot get without giving them my cash), it seemed like a horrendously stupid move as more people started to actually play this game. 
The classes problem was only the beginning. They added flying mounts later(Dragons). At first this sounds like an amazing idea, as these flying mounts were faster than wings. However, you'd have to do daily quests every day for around a month to obtain one. That system was cancer, since logging in every day to do the same thing just to log out was monotonous and boring, Trion decided to scrap that system too. Since players were actually obtaining these mounts(How horrible right? /s), Trion decided to nerf this system and make a convoluted system where getting these dragons was near impossible and you would literally have to spend x3 the time getting these materials(since they divided the item into a 3 part item that needed to be crafted, hence x3 the time), getting these mounts was a fruitless endeavor.
As stated before, the economy was in ruin, so there was no way to be able to recover without buying items to sell in the item mall, or buying mounts directly that increased your level. I gave up at level 100/300, dirt broke even after grinding in the beta and doing 50 hours of grinding after steam release. Streamers have quit, even the streamer's guild I mentioned before had dissipated(LegendaryStudios). All my friends quit and think of this only as a 'meme game'. After Trion added more and more to the item mall that made this game completely pay2win, this game became a generic f2p that lost all originality that this game once was.  This game had a lot of history with me, and now that simply is just a memory.

Beta:
9/10
Steam Release:
5/10
""Cancer"" Patch:
1/10

EDIT1:I have recently read other reviews and I have noticed a common pattern. Devs seem to ignore and lock threads that have expressed concerns for the huge amount of bugs(since I did not mention these in my original review), huge gameplay downsides, and obvious player distaste for the cancer patch. When the players showed their absolute animosity towards changing a major system in the game(such as the classes costing real money), Trion did NOTHING to calm down the players or change this horrible system.

EDIT2:I never knew this review would actually gain a lot of support from the steam community, so thanks for the support. However, I will say be wary of this review and if it gets taken down, you know what happened."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"My advice.... Save your time and money.

I can't emphasize this enough, yes its ""free to play"" but you WILL end up paying something, if not a lot of your hard earned cash. 90% of the same old bugs from beta are still there, events are recycled to the point everyone just AFK farms them and the actual content updates come around once a year. All that is left is grinding. 

Once you get to U9, where the majority of the people are, you will be plagued by rubber banding, slow chunk loading and constant disconnects. The devs really don't care, the fact they refuse to comment on it and delete or lock threads on the forum where people express their concerns, shows this. They just want new people to play, get hooked and shell out loads of cash before they realize it.

I wish I had been warned before I invested so much time/money into the game. (not through steam)

Trove is a great game at its core, its just run by a greedy, money grabbing company with absolutely no respect for its players/customers."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Awesome game, with great content and even better community.
However it's heavy on bugs/glitches and lacking support on forums. Servers & connectivity are horrible!"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews this past week and just wanted to write my review.  Currently 400+ hours into the game.  It is an amazing break from World of Warcraft as leveling up to about 15ish is very easy going.  Weekly rewards are nice to get, and the in-game community is pretty nice and helpful.  Dailies are nice too as after x amount of times opening Chaos Chest, you are guarenteed a mount/ally/something cool.  You get a lot of free stuff at first - like Mastery Rewards and cheap in-game deals (I would suggest buying the starter pack if you can spare $10).  I was expecting to find a lot of little kids playing this game, but I've actually found more young adults and some older adults too.  

If grinding and patience is not your thing, you will not enjoy this game.  The game does have some lag issues, and I've died a few times to it, but it's not all the time.   Building in this game is a bit different than Minecraft, and if you hate building there are plenty of other things to do.  It's definetly more enjoyable with friends or finding new in-game friends!"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I'm filled with nostalgia when I go back to my very first Trove club, to still see it remain standing strong. Even though it is virtually dead, atleast I can see where we first plotted our spawn point, the musical roads, a good quantity of mazes produced throughout the club's life time and numerous buildings that were once endevours. So many friends I stumbled upon during my activeness in the game. I love building with my Trove buddies more than that actual mining, leveling up, and slaining bosses. Happiness filled my soul because of this marvelous game."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"[h1]Trove of adventures![/h1]
[i]As i'm sure everyone would say after playing this game, where should I begin?[/i]

[b]Graphics:[/b]
If I had to say, I wouldn't say top notch. The graphics is okay, they can bug you. Minecraftish style but not as bad. There is alot more animation's, alot more detail. Do not take this the wrong way. The game hasn't done wrong, it feels right in a blocky sense of way.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Fantastic, that's what I say. The gameplay makes up for alot within the game. You can find alot to do. The recent ingame changes are also very nice. New level caps also I noticed. I know Trove gets some nice updates and some odd ones. Either way you cut the cake, you might still get cherries ontop. What I mean is, the updates normally consists of cons n pros, depending on wether you like cherries or not, some cons to others are pros. 
I honestly can't say how much gameplay there is while describing each one. It is just too much. You'll have to read more about it if you don't already know much. Basic gameplay is both creative and adventure. You will want friends or a club world to help out. You can own your own worlds, house, pets. You can wear any decoration, infact, the loot collector and item hunting is very uniqe making you as a player want to find every piece. Each piece you collect is saved & can be overlayered on set equipment. Base game rewards, item shop, minor NPC support. Alot to keep you going. It is mostly PvE, PvP is a thing too.

[b]SoundFX:[/b]
While being blocky in a block like world, you'd expect the characters of the world to sound different. They have nailed this. Music and sounds are pretty good. I'd have to say it wasn't expected but yes, the game sounds are good. The basic attack or hit sounds however is the same old sound, some soundFX are loopy.

[b]PTW or FTP?:[/b]
This is one of the big concerns when entering a FTP game. Yes, it is FTP. 100%
The great thing about trove is how much they actually have to offer FTP. They don't charge you for club worlds or properties, they don't charge you for alot that they could or other games had or do now. The PTW options are minor but continues to support the servers. As any game, PTW has the options to speed up you're progress towards the game or simply for cosmetic styles. It is simply a choice. Do you enjoy the game? Do you feel it is under valued? Do you feel like the devs did decent work? Questions you ask yourself may lead to you spending a few bucks. But by all means, it is only optional, the choices we're in control to make. The game I'd have to say is FTP.

[u][b]Personnal notes:[/b][/u]
This isn't survival, nor is it up to the standards of graphics these days. It is something I do enjoy playing so I must recommend it. Creativity lovers will really enjoy Trove as most already have. I do suggest playing Trove, espeacially if you don't mind low end graphics with high gameplay value. [u]Be warned,[/u] it is a MMO, it is a RPG. put these two together, you got yourself a cracked egg. The game can be very addictive as any MMORPG.

Graphics:5.0
SoundFX:6.0
Funfactor:7.5
Overall:6.5

Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"2k hours and i have to say everything on this game is good but there is some negative things for this game

- super lag game 
- ultra pay to win game ( if you want to go higher mastery rank level you need to buy pack that give you mastery rank xp like 20$ to 50$ to get that pack  there is no free to play on this game if you are rich preson and you don't know where you put your money this game is right place for you. You will be come poor on 2 days)  i have spent like 300$ to this game so may i help devs to fix lag on this game but nothing change. Not only me who spend like that there is some players spend more and more to help devs but nothing change.

i regret play this game , if spend my money to buy new PC better from this S*i*

sorry for my bad English and have good day who ever read this"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,Why did you made it pay to win?
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,Dungeons and dragons in a blocky world
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"This game is great. For anyone that loves to become more and more powerful by leveling up and playing with friends, this is the game for you. For anyone that loves to get endless loot and strive to become one of the most powerful players, this game is for you. But there's a small problem. 

This game is entirely a money run. I don't think I've ever seen a game that is more pay2win than this one. You can literally buy yourself to being some of the most powerful players in the game, despite all those players that choose not to spend any money. Most people who say this game isn't pay2win are people who have spent hundreds of dollars themselves, choosing to deny their own waste of money. For anyone that still thinks this game isn't controllable with money, look at the ""shop"". You can buy all classes, infinite ""gem dust"", and anything else you need to become maxed out. So unless you want to play this game for three years straight while grinding for what seems to be for a fraction of the power the pay2wins have, be my guest and waste your time.


The keyword here, in case you didn't catch it, is: pay2win"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Trove is amazing.........for a while at least. You see, the thrill is present in the beginnings of when you play this game ,but it slowly lessens until you realized that the game is very grindy and boring. The same dungeon, same items, and has a pay2win tone to it and it kinda breaks my heart because of that. The gem update feature makes it feel like the developers want to grab your cash on ""broken gems.""

Maybe if the game gets a HUGE update in gameplay I would rate it better."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"""I legit spent so long on this game.Its pretty good if you want a MMO RPG version of Minecraft."" The game treats its new players way better than its old players. If you want to pay to win then you'll be sure to pass those that have put hundreds of hours into this game. I played this game because i was addicted, the next everyone i knew along with me quit. The game is a cash grab made for those with deep pockets and quick to be pleased with virtual items."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Let us talk about trove: trove is a free to play voxel mmo game that looks smilar to minecraft, this game is really fun to play but the packs are so expensive and the lag is one of the problems that might be a very bad problem when someone invite you to do something with cause you might just miss something , but totally trove is really the best mmo game I have played I think I give it 9/10 maybe ? Thank you for reading this , enjoy this game !"

Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,kinda gets boring in couple hours
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"It's about time i reviewed this game

It was fun for me to grind hours on end to get practically no where. The farming is not rewarding. The entire game is dependant on RNG and chance. Community is half toxic. Classes were acually pretty great. New players are going to have a hard time starting out due to characters now costing money. Much of it is if you pay you can do MUCH better than others. But then again its not worth paying for this game anyways most the time. I did have some great times in this game but it died off from lack of content and purpose. It did however keep me company for a long time, and i did have fun it it while it lasted."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,I've played for a bit. It's pretty good overall.
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I love this game, it's simple but good. The enemies are balanced (usually) The classes are pretty good."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,Very good game and fun to if you like grinding games this is one for you
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Since the ""big"" update  with the power and crap stuff and the game more a pay2play is,I stopped playing, I was mostly on the market buying selling stuff, but since that crap update alot of items I made the flux on weren't tradeable  anymore and alot of shit were to difficult if you didn't buy in game stuff   overall it  was a good game  but since that update the devs killed the game."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"DISCLAIMER: I have clocked much longer on the PS4 version so my playtime is only a fraction of my total playtime.

[h1]Pros[/h1]

Lots of classes
UGC
Group creation (Clubs)

[h1]Cons[/h1]

Not many classes at start
You have to install a special client for the dev's games (why would I install a gaming client from a gaming client?)

Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,Good for a little while but it gets quite repetitive.

Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"this game h elped me get through touygh times xD
"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I'm changing my review, because as of right now, it's not a game that I can recommend. It's very hard for beginners to reach high level, and it's almost impossible to reach end-game if you dont spend countless amounts of money in the game. If you're a free to play player, you're going to need litterally thousands of hours to grind the different resources needed to advance to higher levels, better gear. The gem system is AWFUL, and it needs you to grind time gated resources which obligate you to log in each week and do your weekly quests and challenges. The game gives you no incentive to continue playing, because of the ridiculously useless rewards you're given for being in the higher tiers.

Dont get me started on the Geode update, which is boring, way, wayyy too long to grind all your materials to get to the geode end-game. This update feels like it has nothing to do with trove, as it has absolutely nothing in common with the regular Trove gameplay, and that it's rewards only concern Geode gameplay.

The game is known for it's ""one step forward two steps back"" policy, which means that everytime they add something the community wanted, they find a way to make it fucked up. Trove is heavily relying on RNG instead of relying on pure time spent on the game. A newbie can win super rare stuff that they dont care about when a HL player can spend countless hours of the game getting that item.

According to the wiki, there is 136 different kinds of lootboxes.136. Really? I know a good lot of these are just different tiers of the same boxes but still, it's completely stupid.

When the devs actually start playing the game and start to listen to it's players, and when they decide that the game's code's architechture has to be reworked, I might give the game a second chance."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Epic Game,low quality perfect, and so funny and hard :D"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I like did game but sometimes it becomes too p2p
"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"This game is.. is ... is, i don't know."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I have played since the Open Beta, and yes, I will admit, there have been strong changes to the system, making things harder to obtain, and taking more time, and yes, I will admit it is kind of annoying that Trion are moving in a direction that makes players more likely to pay. But the game is not P2W. Everything is obtainable, spare a few cosmetic items from the store, for free to plays. You can be better than many P2P's while not spending any cash. 

My verdict - If you can bare, or even enjoy the grinding that this game takes, and set yourself goals, and be willing to sacrifice a lot of time, go for it, have fun. If you cannot, atleast try the game till you hit that slow point. It is a very good game, just slow, due to Trion's new money making schemes."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"This game is a lot more fun than it looks. At first when I saw the game on store, I thought it was a really bad attempt at copying Minecraft and other survival games. But I quickly learnt that I was wrong, after trying it out (since the game was FTP). I quickly fell in love with it, both the amount of things inside the game I could do with friends, and the game concept that ties in block building games and RPG in a very neat way. Though maybe to some, the graphics are not the best, as everything is made up of either big or small pixle-blocks, but if you're a fan of 3D pixel graphics like me, or you have actually tried to make 3D riggings of these 3D pixle models, I'm sure you will appreciate the game. The game does not lag a lot for me, despite the servers being located in the US (I live on the other side of the US), and there are many useful and meaningful updates to keep the players interested. This game is great for people who wants to quickly play something before dinner is ready, or could only game a few hours a week due to school, as this game is an easy-to-start and easy-to-put-down game, which means you can quit playing the game at anytime and won't feel bad about it (some games make you feel uneasy to put down by making you lose progress in the game in a certain way if you do quit the game. This game doesn't do that). Anyway, as it's a FTP game, you really don't need to waste your time reading reviews. Only you will know if a game will suit you or not, so instead of reading, get going and give this game a try!"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Me and my friends used to play this game a ton of hours a day, for about a month. And then they added the jewels and sockets and whatever. It wasn't really pay-to-rush, you were able to play for free while people who can pay the devs had their benefits. What really bothered me was the insane amount of RNG they added in the update. We have tried playing the way where you have to grind continously all day to no avail with no progress, but it is devastatingly frustrating. I really started disliking it when the only way to progress was getting lucky. You get stuck at a certain point for a while only because of luck, but in that case they do at least guarentee something every like what - (75?) boxes. Maybe it's just turned into an ultra-hardcore grind game, which isn't what I've looked for a while. 

The game isn't gonna be for everyone."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,not recommended for a newbies without wallet
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,Gud MEMS
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,boring game
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"THIS GAME USED TO BE FUN, and then they added gems and stellar gear and 10 more lvls (bulshit extra grind thats only their for arbitry stat increacces) and changed the severs to potatoes this thing is the laggyest thing i have ever played, it might be a glyph thing ive had a very symilar experiance with another of their porducts, well all of that was a year ago apparrently and since then theyve added one still bugged to hell class (Citation needed) and .....mounts soooo many mounts soo many tottaly cosmetic grind to attain mounts. Mounts do not equal content.As of this moment i can only recomend that you stay the hell away from this game."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Okay, I'm just gonna keep this short and sweet...

Cons:
- repetitive worlds
- dull leveling
- pay to win
- pvp is unbalanced and horrible
- late game grind is unbearably dry and elongated
- bugs that make classes unplayable when another player with the same class is nearby
- boring combat
- no new abilities while leveling

Pros:
- I mean...

I do have 430-ish hours on this game, yes. But the only reason I kept playing was because of how addicted I was, once you hit end game and start grinding for higher level gear the game becomes unbearably awful."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,pay 2 win...
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,amazing game ten out of ten
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,This game has a unique perspective to it. now thats my own opinion. all my friends play this and its a really fun game slaying mobs and teaming with friends to take over places and kill bosses and all that. i highly recomment this game to those people who just stopped by to see this game.
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"this game turns me on
would recommend"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,dank meme game very stronk ingame material would r8 8/8 but no umaru in game so u get a 7/8
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Money hungry, laggy af, earned the nickname grind. Im able to run tf2 lowest settings 60 fps, why not this game? People should also be able to buy full DRAGONS THAT ARE IN FULL FORM for relatively low price, like buy this 20$ for 1 full dragon!"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"It is an incredibly remarkable game. You don't even have to actually spent a cent on it. The graphics are well-designed. The people are helpful. The community is great. The battling is just perfect. The farming as usual for most games is fun and repitetive but it's also always rewarding at the end. 

Love this game :) I recommend you play it."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,well it's fun. if you want something that can kill time just do it
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,this game is awesome and it is great play
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,Great RPG Game.Also Its Free SO you got nothing to lose
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"You will only have a decent time if your connection is very good and if you have a good computer, otherwise the servers are laggy pieces of shit and the devs are somewhat incompetent."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,love it....but i warn you its a grinding for loot game(witch i love) i love grinding for loot like in destiny sooooo. its fun...BUT! plz just go get warframe if you can run it.
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"its a great game the updates make it better and ur never done there are challanges and more
the only bad thing is that it laggs"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I only played for 2.5 hours and all I have to say is: It's a good and fun MMORPG game for kids to play. Mostly age of 8-18.
So if you're older than that, there's a pretty high chance that you won't enjoy it and I would suggest that you look for something else.

But if you like cartoony things and stuff or are in that age range then this might be fun for you to play. 

Best played with friends because you have to spend a lot of time behind the game to farm and doing it alone will really bore you and make you feel lonely. So try to play with at least one friend beside you."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Fun for the first 2 hours with friends then you realise its just getting to new dungeons, better loot, then onto the next dungeon"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Trove... Where to start with Trove...
I was a long time player of Trove, disregard the time I've played, as I started sometime way back in 2014, near the end of closed beta, I believe, and the game was great. The combat was simple enough that anyone could pick it up and, after a few battles, know how to play their class. The worlds were flooded with people looking to find new recipes and improve their cornerstones in any way, while also looking for gear and xp. The worlds were beautiful and it felt like you were actually getting somewhere when you went from one world to another, as new biomes were added and new enemies alongside it. Everything could be done for free, at the time there were only 3 classes (I think...), gunslinger, knight, and fae trickster. You started the game with the knight and the gunslinger, and every other class could be bought with the ingame currency, Cubits. New classes were added left and right (I took a liking to the Dracolyte), and it felt like the devs truly cared about the game, as they fixed every bug someone came acrossed. 
As I continued to play, they introduced more things, such as the dragons. The dragons started out pretty simple, you had little ""missions"" that would pop up every once in a while, tasking you with completing dungeons, and if you used a certain class, you'd get 2 points rather than one, and you'd need 5 points to get your first dragon cache (sorry if any of these things aren't the correct terms, haven't played in a while), and another if you got somewhere in the 20s. These caches had a chance to give you things such as dragon essence and souls, which were used to ascend and get companions and mounts. The concept was great, I had fun with it, and many others did too.
After a while it started to go downhill REALLY quickly. The first sign was, well, the devs removed the ability to buy classes with cubits. At first it seemed harmless, they still gave out class coins every once in a while, and the classes themselves weren't too expensive. Then they added gems, which I'm not too familiar on, but supposedly just make you straight up better than others, and the things to obtain them were either really rare (rare, RNG, same thing, just RNG is less reliable), or could be bought with real cash. At this time, I quit, the community was destroyed, the game was broken, and nothing was rewarding.

Game used to be good, then Trion did what Trion does best.

Edit: Take what I say with a grain of salt, haven't played in a while."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Awesome game, but it gets boring quick. After you unlock characters you want to play as, you notice that there isn't many things to do. You notice players who are much stronger than you because it's pay to win game. It's awesome that a free mmorpg game but it's not really ""free"". It's not worth your time."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,i played trove a lot and i need to say it was fun but it gets boring over time
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Like grinding for mounts and gear this is the game for you m8. This game grows quickly, and the different biomes, and classes are great! Candy Barbs are the best!"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Very interesting game. If u have friends, you will enjoy :)"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"About the Game:

You fight, mine, and help build your home. It is a game in which you use both creativity, adventure, and the need for better gear that drives this game. The game is free to play but has several costs at the benefit of this. This game is more of a grind, dungeon, and building game.

Reasons to Get the Game:

The main reason for me was that it was FREE. As in no cost, but there is always a cost and item that requires you to pay the company who made trove. Examples are like Costumes, Different Mounts, and Loot Crates that help give you a type of Gambling feel into a game. The best part of the game is that it is one of the free games that include BUILDING. Building your own home from a simple house to a cool castle or tower makes the game more fun and better. If you have nothing to do I recommend to get the game and just try it out.

Problems Regarding the Game:

The problems regarding it is the INSANE level of grinding for better loot and in-game currency to make your character look at least decent. The next problem is the building area: The building are is not as big as you think it would be. So I recommend that before you start building plan accordingly to the size given and use it to your advantage. For Example, a tower would be good for the Building Space Provided.

Overall Result:

I recommend on trying the game out because it is a free-to-play game. It helps me have something to do when I have lost interest in other games.

Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"i would love to say trove is an amazing and great game but sadly it has gotten boring because it repeats itself too much, basically same dragons, same worlds, just grind all day to get anywhere, shadow towers on monday, and by that point you'll be wanting to do something else. i see theyre slowly making progress to change that with minigames but still."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"In my opinion, this is an amazing RPG game, I started playing about 1-2 years ago and stopped for a while, because I got bored of it, but just recently I came back to it and thought I'd play again, and now I'm really enjoying it again and having fun dungeon farming and dragon collecting! :)

Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,Looks gay but is actually fun

If you have any..."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,its just GG
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Pros:

Great community
Great sandbox options
Smooth gameplay
Vibrant, colorful, happy environments.
Player-driven economy.
RNG loot drops.
Fun bosses
Great zoning out while listening to music game
Catchy music. VERY catchy music.
You can be a pirate riding a dragon.
You can be a dragon riding a dragon.
There are like a million dragons now.
Seriously. Dragons.
Classes are unique in design.
Fae.

Cons:

Takes a million years to grind 20-30 on a single class. (Runescape level experience curves near the last few levels.)
Gem system is pointless time waster medium for grinding stats.
Used to be able to buy classes for free currency, no more after MoP.
RNG loot drops.


Summary:
Trions pay2win model came into effect with MoP. The game simply is not fun unless you spend money on it., or focus purely on the sandbox aspect. Period. Unless you have countless hours and no life to throw away like I did. (or are talented at merching the player driven economy.)

Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"This game is quite good! I have not put much time into it after realizing that I am not very fond of the game and others by these genres, I did give it a try. I do have to say that it is a really good, well made game that gets frequent updates suggested by the players. If you enjoy Blockland, this is quite similar to it, but without many game modes and servers you need to join. The community is quite kind as well!"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,cant play the game to write a helpfull review as the game launchs in 4k (which im capible) but the options menu is out of  my screen so i cant change the resolution or launch in windowed mode to fix the issue first game i downloaded that i cant play lol or fix or anything spent about 20 min on it im over it
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I can't recommend this game at all, at first it's pretty fun but the fun only lasts a few hours.

The game is extremely repetitive, you'll see this once you get up a few levels and have to enter the same area over and over and over to level up. That is the entire game, all the way up, just re-entering areas over and over again to level up until you get to endgame, just to do it some more. 

There is very very little content. Once you get a little far into the game you realize that all you've done is go to the same maps over and over and over, the game itself is absolutely tiny.

It is ""pay to progress"" to the point where you'd have to be crazy to play for free. It implements the ever so popular ""nag you at every single corner to pay"" which is easily just as bad as blatant ""pay to win"", if not worse, because ""pay to progress"" generally means a much higher cost to keep up than blatant pay to win.

The crafting system is extremely basic for a voxel game. It feels almost as if the developers just looked at minecraft and copied the crafting/building at the most basic level just because it's voxel and it might appeal to minecraft players.

Extremely poorly optimized for a tiny voxel game with very little content. Not much to say here, my friends had issues with half decent machines that could run most games on medium/high.

I have to say, I'm generally very forgiving when I review games, but this game's only positive is that it is a cute voxel game. May even be the worst game I've ever reviewed, It is very clear that this isn't a project made out of love, it is a project made to capitalize off of the success of another game (Minecraft)."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,haven't seen so much grinding in one game until i started playing trove
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,Shit servers. The rest is nice
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Servers are trash and there is nonstop lag. It's not because I have bad internet because the entire global chat complains about it too. Also, it's completly pay to win. Without money you might as well go fuck yourself cause you'll waste so much time grinding. Despite this, I still enjoy playing this game and I wish Trion would fix their servers

Edit: I found out why the servers are laggy. I'm put into the EU servers because the NA are full. But the game still crashes a lot for me."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,It's good.
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"It is a nice game to play with your friends, or just yourself! It is kinda a Pay-to-win, but it is still fun.

STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,Massively%20Multiplayer,1286830,it has lazorz
STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,Massively%20Multiplayer,1286830,"Well right now I'm just playing the Jedi Knight story line.  But the story telling seems to be solid.  Like that you can go as deep as you want into various activities or not.  It's awesome that there's no addon reliance but they addressed quality of life stuff so that the usual grind for gear is not as bad.  Standard high level gear drops will be good enough unless you are really wanting to do 8 or 16 man groups and the hardest modes of each then you will need to chase the monkey some but if find a guild that's active in those areas it's not too bad. But it's the Star Wars universe yes it's 3000 years before the movies but you are walking/running thru the same places  as your movie characters just at a different time.  Lots of story telling, lots of content, lots of exploration. Very much an MMO that can keep you occupied for some time.  The lack of social / guild finding in game is sort of sad I mean you literally have to go old school and go into forums of different sites and looks for posts from guilds looking for players.  There are general chat posts of guilds looking but from a quality of life perspective it could be better.  You can have your own stronghold, guild stronghold, guild ship stronghold, multiple properties and such so lots to do there.  Haven't touched crafting but seems to be a credit sink except for those folks that began from the beginning.  The economy is a little wonky for the prices not sure why that is but you get plenty of drops to sell and such.  Companions and pets are here also.  So it's like most MMO's in general but again I say ""OMG it's Star Wars!!!!"" that makes it worth it right there.  They have truly made an MMO that allows a player to decide how deep or what type of experience do you want and it's not tied to the great rat race of chasing raids to get gear.  If you want to do the hardest stuff then you will go down that path but most of the game does not require that kind of requirement. I've played WoW , ESO , Neverwinter and several others they all have their place.  SWTOR seems to have found several avenues for fans of Star Wars to enjoy their adventure at their pace.  Good Job!!!!  There's lots more but learning about it is an adventure as well."

Totally Accurate Battlegrounds,Massively%20Multiplayer,823130,super unbalanced. played in the beta and it was good
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"It's been years since I purchased this game, and I've played for too long to be deemed healthy by health professionals. Seeing where this game started, and where it is now, I can only say:

I am Disappointed. 

I joined when you could play exclusively in a progressive tree (Small dinosaurs for x amount of times leads to the next tier of dinosaurs) to produce an ecology of sorts. They added AI, more rivers and lakes and removed progression. This, with the idea of promoting a sort of self sustained ecology, backfired. Discords promote pay to grow (discord points through donating to help keep servers running for example), means there are servers that are 95%+ carnivores, and of those, are likely spinos/gigas/rexes. They can survive exclusively on the added AI (this was not possible when it first started), and if they die, they can come back as full grown top tier carnivores within minutes. There is no ecology. 

Combat went from hiding in bushes, to abusing broken hit-boxes, or crossing fingers that lag was working for you and not against you. Imagine playing Darksouls but your dagger has the range of a claymore at 2x size. 

Today? They have legacy (Beta) and Evrima (Beta Beta). Legacy is broken hitboxes and laggy, Evrima is testing a new combat system. Great. There is no effort to making a standing ecology however. both versions have rubber banding issues, and playing a single player is difficult and have GREATLY reduced odds if having to survive against clans/groups of friends. The removal of global chat in official servers have reduced the amount of -toxic- chat in game, but have successfully pushed people to using 3rd party programs with reduced capability of warning other players of misbehavior in servers. 

Promises. Promises. So many things promoted to publix that haven't seen light in years. ""Hypo"" Dinosaurs were seen briefly before being revoked from public access. Only devs could use them, and then devs stopped visiting server to show, no, -flaunt- this exclusive feature until the lack of existance. Humans being added? No. Cannibals being added? No. Vicious environments? No (Except for crippling fall damage from cliffs and drowning) Number of dinosaurs available for public use? Reduced. Number of customizable skins? Reduced (Earthy/muted Color palettes in Legacy have shown promise, but there is only 1 skin available and no color changing in Evirma currently)

I feel in the years that have passed by, that the isle has shown very very poor improvement, and I don't expect this game to be better for -several years- at the rate and history that it has shown. 

There was improvement for the first year. After that, it's been a heart break to watch this beast slowly decay and become ruined. The community is divided between people who hate the game and people who can only hope for the best. These two side will viciously attack the other in defense of their opinion. A quick youtube search or a visit to the isle reddit can give you any little bit of research to decide your fate on clicking 'Buy"".

I post this review as a warning. It's fun for a little bit, but for a long term game, set your expectations low. I'll watch updates, but highly not recommend people playing due to slow development, lacking features, and toxic community."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"The first thing to know about The Isle in 2021 is the two separate versions: Legacy and Evirma.

 Legacy is the ""default"" version of the game, and the version most people play. It has lots of dinosaur species and a very active playerbase, AI dinosaurs for carnivores to hunt down, massive well detailed maps dotted with human landmarks, rivers, lakes, mountains, jungles, grasslands and beaches, and two main gamemodes: survival and sandbox. In sandbox, every non-exclusive dinosaur in the game is playable. You start as an adult and basically do whatever you want. This can range from Death Matches to Dino Chatting Rooms. In survival, less species are available but the gameplay is more dynamic. You start as a baby dino, either a juvenile on your own or a hatchling with a mother. As you feed, hunt and survive, you grow in size and strength, becoming faster and more formidable until you become a fully grown adult. It is often necessary to form groups with members of your own species to better the chances of surviving. If you are a female dino, you can have your own young when you become adult (The nesting system allows other players to teleport to you as hatchling dinos, but they are completely dependent on you until they become juveniles.)

So that's what Legacy has to offer. But whats the catch?

Legacy is the abandoned version of The Isle, no longer receiving updates from the devs. As such, it has lots of bugs, ranging from minor annoyances to game breaking glitches such as oversized hitboxes, rubberbanding, FPS drops, disconnections and more. There are also a few ""tricks"" that undermine the basic values of the game, such as tail riding. It can be more than infuriating when you lose your dino to something only describable as bad game design. Food spawns are also fickle. Certain regions of the maps lack AI for carnivores or bushes for herbivores. As such, many players tend to gather around hot spots rather than explore the maps. There are also toxic players who partake in frowned upon behavior such as ""carebearing"" or taking care of dinos that arent your own species, or ""KOSing"" or killing everything in sight for fun.

Now what about Evirma?

Evirma is an entirely new version of The Isle, a complete recode that was started after the Legacy code became too troublesome and frustrating for the dev team to work with. It has a lot of the features that Legacy had with more yet to come, in addition to many exciting new features including an entirely new map, new dinosaurs, reworks of old dinosaurs, new mechanics such as grazing for herbivores, grabbing dragging and swallowing kills for carnivores, new playstyles for unique creatures like pteranodon and deinosuchus, and new systems for food, perks and elder dinosaurs. Everything in Evirma is much more fluent and natural than Legacy, from movement to combat to the ecology of every distinct species. 

The catch?

Evirma is somewhat bare bones as of now, possessing a far smaller dino roster than Legacy. some features like the diet and elder systems have yet to be added, and as usual there are bugs. However, there have been regular patches and bug fixes from the devs, with a roadmap for future large scale updates already planned out.

Overall, The Isle is a very unique take on the survival genre, and a delight for fans of dinosaurs and paleontology. Progress has been slow but steady, and the game already has a lot of promise with its dynamic gameplay. If you love survival games and dinosaurs, this ones for you. If you're more a fan of fast paced games, maybe pass on this one (Growth takes a while :D.)"
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"After 1325 Hours of this game I think I can give a decent Review...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEGACY IS DEAD - Not being updated at all and has hardly any player base at least for Australia.

Erivma is Alive - BUT is a toxic pool of Mixpacking Chinese hackers that will find you and hunt you down eventually due to ESP hacks. (They also love to sh!t talk in broken English while they kill you)

If you don't die to these people, you're most likely gonna die to people that just kill for sport, so in the long run its just a waste of time, no objective.. just mindlessly killing and eating.

Yes the official servers ""Have No Rules""  BUT that doesn't mean you should be hacking OR ruining the game for others by just making a MEGA PACK of 5 Stegos 5 Crocs and 8 Carnos to run and kill everyone on the Server..

Honestly at the end of the day I do love this game and have met many good friends, maybe I'll reinstall it some day when they fix these issues, but atm its unplayable for me."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I've played that game for quite a while now and I have to admit it's not for everyone.
it does have a lot of bugs but is still a loveable game.
once you know how to play and use specific dinosaurs it will bring a lot of fun.
at the beginning it will be frustrating but when you find the right people to play with it's going to be a lot of fun^^
may I wish you a happy hunt^^"

""[i][strike]Life[/strike] [u]Death[/u] finds a way.[/i]"""
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"One of the hardest ""Not recommended""s I've ever had to write up. On one hand, the game is unique, tense and fun. But on the other, it is a complete f**king headache to even bother playing or to work up the want to play it. 

In the base game, whatever stupid name you wanna give it. You have to contend with rules, admins and children the likes of which not seen since modern GMod, let alone the whining, crying and other annoying vitriol one puts up with. On top of that, the devs cannot handle criticism and throw bitch fits if someone has a differing opinion than them.

As for EVRIMA or the ""It'll work this time guys"" version:
Imagine spending hours, LITERAL HOURS trying to grow up or find other people so you can chat to someone finally or go for a drink/do something that isn't just wandering aimlessly with nothing in sight but the occasional fish. Now, you finally find others, members of your own species no less, you should be glad right? Wrong, it doesn't matter if you're utahraptor, deinosuchus, even a fucking pteradon. You will be attacked and cannibalized by your own species. Why? Because players are assholes and they've nothing better to do because EVRIMA is empty, and boring. 

TLDR: Great game but expect a lot of wasted time, headaches and dealing with shitters who kill you solely because they can and they were on the server for HOURS before you, meaning they had a day to waste getting big and ready to grief new spawns."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,dino born- dino eat- dino die
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I do not recommend this game yet, it has so many bugs, almost as many as cyberpunk 2077, the development is super slow, and it's not worth your money right now, maybe in a year or so, cuz they update the game like every two months, and it's not even big updates."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"This game used to be a sandbox in which you picked your favourite dinosaur and sat for a few hours to level up to a fully grown animal before sitting once again but this time surrounded by far smaller animals using you as an insurance policy, and before that was the progression system which, well no. Had the game remained in that state I would likely have voted it down but the new Evrima version of the game (which you can opt into under the Beta tab in properties) is actually very good. There aren't many animals to choose from in this early version of the rework yet it still feels 100x the living and breathing ecosystem that the original version wasn't. In Evrima all of the animals feel like classes with their own strengths, weaknesses and abilities. Evrima's Carnotaurus is a swift but tall pursuit predator that can run exceptionally fast in a straight line but fails to handle turns well, a good way of turning real science into compelling class strengths and weaknesses. The Utahraptor can grasp lunge and pin, as well as being generally very agile, and the newcomers to Evrima the Pteranodon which is the first aerial animal to be properly implemented, and the Deinosuchus which controls fantastically and feels like the most fleshed out of the four despite being one of the newest. The Deinosuchus does have the issue of facing nearly no competition once grown outside of being killed by other Deinosuchus players but this will likely change when the reworks for other animals are finished like the T-rex, and Spinosaurus especially as a rival aquatic class. This game has gone from feeling like an experimental chat room in which people growl at each-other to an actual class-based sandbox game and its genuinely exciting to see what comes next."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,If a game can be a scam this is it.  The devs are incompetent and never produce updates on time or even the things they promised in the multiple road maps. Instead of improving the game they constantly break it with 'bug fixes' every time something new is introduced. This is the only game I have ever seen actually go BACKWARDS in development and become WORSE than it was before. Save you and your friends money and just get Beasts of Bermuda or Path of Titans.
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,Haha funny dinosaur game go brrrrr
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I have 10.8 hours in the game. This was right before envirma was a thing. The game was about a 5/10 at best in *legacy* mode. it was time consuming, empty, and rather boring. I LOVE dinosaurs and this game had a very good down to earth approach to them. There was no objective and most players resorted to creating their own ways to play. now flash forward a few days and envirma comes out. the game is now a 2/10 at best. When envirma launched it took out EVERYthing they worked on and players came to enjoy. It was laggy, unplayable, crashed all the time. and even less things to do and less dinos to play. The art and sound direction are the 2 points this game gets. they have spent so much time and money and resources recreating the game that im sure they will cease production in the coming years.

I got a good 8 hours out of regular of what you could call*fun* 
2 hours into envirma i could realize the ball was dropped and i never picked it up again.

Save your money until the devs put out some real ginormous fixes/changes/improvments.
I really wanted to like the game, but sadly it just wasn't good."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,miarrr
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"Okay. The Isle gives me mixed feelings. I absolutely love the gameplay, and the graphics look insane and run at a low cost even at the highest setting. Its honestly one of my favorite games I've ever played. With the exception of one major thing. The community. I knew and I didn't listen, I thought everyone was pulling my leg. They weren't. In fact they were undermining just how horrible the community, and developers are. I got harassed for about an hour non stop on a sandbox server before finally getting fed up with it enough to ask for help. The admins of the server themselves began catching an attitude with me just wanting to hang out. What the fuck? This wouldn't be an issue with Primal Carnage, a literal PVP death match game? As much as i loved this game growing up, I cant leave a beaming review without properly going over a MAJOR flaw of this game. The fans seem to inherit the developers ""Well even if I can help, I'm too lazy to be bothered to get off my ass and do something about it"" mentality. There's a handful of bugs, and some of the worst people I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. I've met a total of two cool people through this game whereas with BoB and PC:E, I have met countless. Please encourage your players to be more positive to their fellow players, or many just wont have the motivation to play anymore. I might only have 14 hours but that's enough for me to have seen the surface of how toxic the community is."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,Beta branch has not been stable for weeks and it's a new fatal error every update. Feeling like a lot of broken promises and minimal support is the final nail in the coffin.

"
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"It's a very fun game, but people cannibalizing their own kind for no reason is rampant and takes the fun out of the game. Imagine being a spinosaurus hatchling for hours, just drinking and eating, and when you're finally almost medium size mama logs off and a random group member kills you for no reason. There NEED to be HUGE debuffs for cannibalizing your own, and I will not recommend this game until it has been fixed."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"The game is gorgeous, the animations are superb, and the sound design is leagues ahead of any other immersive game I can think of besides Subnautica. That being said, the leadership of the game is an absolute mess to put it politely. Dondi is confused at best and willfully obstinate at worst. His leadership has left this game in purgatory for 5+ years. They went back to square 1 and aren't even anywhere close to what they had before. Sure, there are new mechanics and better animations but the gameplay loop is non-existant (not even nesting or different genders anymore) and the options to choose from are few. The hit boxes are also still questionable at best. The only thing that makes this game fun is when you have friends to play with and you troll other people. Maybe if the game ever gets done I can recommend it but if you pay anything over 5 bucks then it's a ripoff."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"Bought this game on sale. I could not make a private server. It loaded into a black screen. Asked the community about it and according to them, you need to turn your settings down and if that doesn't work, you are one of the people who can't play singleplayer due to a bug that has been known for years. Uhh ok? So attempted to join a server. Couldn't join any servers despite my graphics being turned down low (I have a beast of a computer anyway). I just got stuck on 11% in the loading screen on all servers. Again. A known bug that has existed for TWO YEARS. What the hell kind of dev priorities are those? How long can a game be in ""early access"" with such aggregious bugs like that? Just call the game what it is, unfinished and soon to be obsolete since they can't come out with fast fixes like POT is doing. I reccommend checking out what POT is up to instead because their devs are very active. Refund on The Isle requested."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"This game is great. I got it back in 2018 as a Christmas gift. I'd played Legacy version for most of my time owning this game and have met countless people who are really amazing. The community itself I wouldn't say is the greatest, in fact it can be rather toxic but finding the right server and the right player base within that server can really give you an experience you would go back for. With Evrima launched I hope to see amazing things come from it though right now it seems a bit worse for wear in some aspects. I know we don't have the same amount of dinos straight away but bigger and better things are coming to this game in more ways than one. I love the new combat system and the introduction of newer dinosaurs like Tenonto, Deinosuchus, and Pteranodon. We have officially achieved flight and that is amazing as well as a terrifying dino to jumpscare people with. I can't wait to see what else the devs have to offer in terms of mechanics and even the skin system once it is implemented. The Isle is going to be a whole new game, and I'm ready for it. If you decide to give the game a chance, find the right place and people, I guarantee you'll have some good times here and there."

The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"Rating Evrima as is.
Evrima is currently unplayable. The official servers are laggy and constantly rubberband no matter how good your connection is. Unofficial servers are either empty(therefore unplayable excepts for herbivores) or have absurd rules that defeat the purpose of Evrima.
It's really unfortunate because the Evrima stress test servers were really fun and stable."

The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"This world has changed much since I last walked upon it. Tell me of the great Hunting grounds, are they very beautiful ? Ah, now I remember... The ways of the hunt return to me... I see more clearly now. Once, I was a great beast... Fear nothing, the Adults are here. You are our hatchlings, grown though we are, we shall not abandon you. My Instincts show me my Purpose in these trying times... I continue to Hunt, chase them before me once more.

Let us join in this ferocious cause. 
let our minds work as one.
The Predators have returned. We seek the adventure only the Hunt can bring.
Their Scent foretold of this place.
We have mastered the art of evisceration. We are ferocity incarnate.
Our roars herald the coming of great pain for our prey. Our song is the promise of their destruction.
The Pack is ready, the stage is set. We've come to dance the dance of death.
Many are born, few survive.
All who have live fear the Hunter.
The Pack goes where the Scent leads.
We are shaped by our nature just as we shape it.
Blood and claws, only the strong deserve to live.
They shall see their future laid bare, and terrible !
Our murderous prowess has taken the stage.
I have found truth in carnage. I scent all, wherever they may hide.
The future is clouded and uncertain.
This Path ends in blood, but who's ?
Only the bravest shall know the thrill of live and death.

Let their scent reveal our Prey !
Hunt, always hunt... 
The Hunt is eternal.
Uncertainty and and fear retreat from my mind.
Long ago, my broodmother foretold this day. 
My nightmares whispered that such a terror could exist !
Fortune has hated our kind for millennia, but now we shall change this !
The blood of many beasts stains our jaws... But there shall be more to come ! 
Those prey-thieves and scavengers cannot be allowed to stand !
Our choices are gone. We have but one recourse left: 

The Pack Elder !

Behold ! The fercocious eviscerator of prey !
I walk again, A god among mere beasts.

The Pack is assembled, and we fully commit ourselves to the chase.
Within this fatefull hour, If you would not see yourselves starve, fight now with tooth and claw !
We shall scourge them as our ancestors once did, and wreak havoc amongst their kin.
However distant, their scent lights our path.
I know the power of my flesh ! My Claws teart he thickest hides, My jaws crush the hardest bones !
In the hunt there is poetry, in death release. I have my role to play on this great stage.

The Alpha guides us. We deliver death to wherever they are.
So we meet on the Great Hunting grounds. By my bloody jaws, our prey shall not elude us this day.
Ah, more beasts to slay, What a feast for our pack. Their corpses will litter the great Hunting Grounds.
Kill them ! Must Kill them !

So, we dance the dance of death again. Hunt with me, as you did in your youth ! Come and relieve the great hunts of your youth !
They have chose such grim fate too...
Let us contest out rightfull prey !
I will roar my anger out now.

To battle !

Alpha, guide our Jaws !
Bite their necks, cleave their spines !
Our paths cross these scavengers...
With dozens of Teeth, I bite through.
Taste their blood, pumped by hatred !
Reap their corpses !
Manifest the tempest !
We are here to exact harsh and terrible judgement, and the slaughter therein.
Our claws as one !
Exterminate them !
I will join this dance of death !
We claim their flesh !
Suffer a thousand bite !
They cannot escape the pack !
See your death in my eyes, prey.
We will undo them, then we feast.
Reduce all of them to bones and flesh !
We are Curtis' Hounds, out to hunt !
Strength from unquenchable hunger !
They feel the the grasp of death.
Their lives come to an end.
Our purpouse is to devour them, let no effort be spared !

All Shall Die !

My strength is the pillar upon which this pack has been built. The Great Hunting grounds call for me, and I respond in kind. Nothing remains unchanged by the cruelty of nature.
I hear the song of the Great Hunt, and the music is cacophonous. it is strange, but I find comfort in its dissonance. Bringing death to the herbivores is what has given my kin purpouse, when by all rights we as a species should have collapsed in upon ourselves. It is such moments that Hunters find their greatness or settle back to become the hunted once more. For my self, I aspire to nothing but to help my offspring thrive upon this cruel world. Life or death, inflicting this wound is already my victory, their desperate screams my triumph. It is now fate that shall decide whether I will be there to feast with my Hatchlings or not.

Bloodloss torments me, I can no longer resist the sweet call of the infinite. Their blows rain heavy. My bones crack. The light of my consciousness dims. I return to slumber, to eternal rest. do not forgot my struggle..."

The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"Description : Supposed to be a ""realistic"" dinosaure game, reality :

Fucking impossible to play solo... just to much grief for no reason from your own species and nothing is ever done to try and fix it ! The dev absolutely don't care about the issue and i even tend to think that cannibalism is what they intend with their game wich is absolutely dumb as sh** on a dinosaure game... the issue is that soon they are gonna realise that it completely deters solo player from enjoying the Isle, hell, even with a team it gets impossible to play because of that some times. I'm sorry the game has potential but without this fixed i won't change my negative review. Having to wait hours and hours to grow and actually be able to hunt just to be killed mindlessly by a fucking as***** peace of sh** cannibal of your own species for absolutely no reason is just not possible guys seriously, test your game (without saying your a dev of course) and you'll see how boring it actually is... And as a player their ain't nothing you can do about it either with the whole having to wait 300sec before responing to the same place rule... 
  
I will also add that redoing the game from scratch might not be the best move ever when your dev team is this small, having to wait 6 month for a frieking dino is just not enjoyable.

You can think what you want from this review and it's actually my first review ever, i really never post reviews but i'm sorry enough is enough. I am posting this because i really wanna enjoy this game and see it being good but it is just not playable right now even at 20 Euros i don't recommend waisting your time and money on this, so please for the love of god get a BIGGER dev team and before doing anything else get rid of the grieving issue one way or another.

Oh and for people who will use the cannibalism is realistic blablabla yeah you might be right but on a dino real lifespam it's different that when you have 3 hours to play a day after coming back home from work. So yeah if you leave it that way i guess enemployed or retired people are the only ones who will be able to play your game."

I have not really played so I cannot recommend this shit to anyone"
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,this is the best dino game ever
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I can play as a Dinosaur? Awesome. And it is, at first. If you can get used to the bugged controls, the wonky hit boxes, atrocious lag and server admins that only seem to care if something directly affects their game.

The links to the discords are almost all broken, which btw, is the only place you'll find the rules for most servers since for some stupid reason they cant put that in this 6 YEAR OLD GAME. So you have it one of two ways. Either take the time, find the discord servers with the rules and get bodied for trying to follow them or ignore them and just hope you dont come across an admin.

The combo of server lag and trash hit boxes can make playing as any carnivore an extreme test of patience in the best scenario and a waste of hours of playtime at the worst. While dying is certainly part of the game, it should be because you've been outplayed or just did something stupid. Not because the game fails to do the literal only thing its actually supposed to do.

I was really excited about this game and I gave it a real shot. If it wasnt several years old Id say give it some time but with a game this age and even the most basic things being broken I dont have much hope."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"Huge waste of time

Spend an excessive amount of time growing to an adult, encounter a bug in the game effectively killing you in seconds

The game is awesome and yes get it"
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"My friend and I bought this game and we were disappointed. We both refunded it. The survival mechanics are so unforgiving that it makes the game a miserable experience. The concept is so cool, yet this game will not live up to any expectations you have for it. Also, to even play with other people you have to join really poorly made servers hosted by other people and it takes an extreme amount of effort to find anyone on the map. Unfortunately, I would never recommend this game."

[h1]The Isle - WHY SO BAD?[/h1]

I don't even know where to start. I've already played some games with dinosaurs, such as Ark: Survival Evolved, Primal Carnage, Dino D-Day, and some other unpopular ones that I can't remember.

So, recently, Steam launched discounts on open-world games, among them was The Isle.
I knew about this game for a long time, saw a couple of videos and decided to take it.

I went into the game, immediately chose the most popular server, with around 120 players online, decided which dinosaur I would play for and stomped forward.

My first thought was like - oh cool! A survival game, where you are a dinosaur, where you do not need to loot, build a base, fight NPCs.
My second thought was like – where is the loot, where is my base, where are NPCs?

The game clearly lacks a bit of refinement. The tutorial at the beginning is too poor, I couldn't figure out how to find food and water for a long time. It says that I need to press the Q button, but this didn’t give any result. At first, I thought that maybe there was nothing around me and I all I did was running forward, stopping periodically to sniff, and continue running.
Then I noticed that the dinosaur turns its head in a certain direction, and I thought that maybe its head shows me where to move, like a hunting dog does. So I just ran where my head was looking. It brought me to a mountain. I thought, well, I'll definitely find something behind the mountain. Have you ever seen a stegosaurus rock climber? Of course not, because they slip and die...

Okay, second attempt, I decided that I need some help and asked in the global chat. It turns out that you need to hold the button for about five seconds until your lizard sniffs the entire planet and then the food will be highlighted so hard that you just can’t oversee it.

Okay, I figured that out, but what's next? By pressing all the buttons I figured out which buttons are responsible for the attack and different roars. Now I just need to find some civilization. Even on such a populated server, I almost didn't find any players I could join. There were some predators running around on the beach, but that’s not the date I was looking for. In tinder, I would swipe left.

While running around, I noticed some shortcomings of the game – sometimes textures disappear, sometimes you lagg until the world loads. To be honest, it lacks some tasks, at least some most basic ones, like finding other players of your species and joining them, eating a certain number of berries, bushes, or for predators to kill a certain number of other dinosaurs. You can come up with a huge number of achievements that way. By the way the game doesn’t have any achievements at all!

The game provides almost nothing to a solo casual player. You can’t just login for an hour and enjoy the game. Nothing will happen during this hour. At best, you get killed, you get your shot of adrenaline, and then you start all over again. 

I studied the community bit and realized that these are mainly roll players or groups of friends who sit in their discord channel, communicate and wander around the world. This is certainly cool, a loyal base of players who have come up with their own rules and follow them. But this is probably not what I was looking for and what I expected from the game.

For the sake of interest, I also logged into a random sandbox server to see what was happening there. But I wish I hadn't. I still don’t understand what the players are doing there... an ugly map with random buildings, players spawnkill each other... my nerves couldn't stand it, and I committed suicide... jumped from the board into the pool. 

My first rendezvous with this game ended up in a money refund.
Personally, I didn't like the game. But I know that there are fans of the game, who have already played it for thousands of hours, and I understand that it has a right to exist. I really hope that the developers will continue to work on it, remove all the problems, add new content and not let it die out.

I will be very happy to hear your opinion in the comments! Maybe I had a wrong approach to this game, and I missed the most important thing? After all, the game has a fairly high score in the Steam Store.
That's it, will be happy if you like the video and subscribe to my channel! Bye!

The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"its a lovey game don't get me wrong with some good ideas, But it lacks polish and a proper solo play the controls aren't made fully apparent a lot of this is down to the payer base making the game good."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"After 400 hours on this game...I can honestly say it's crap but fun.

I'm not going to do pros and cons because what is a pro for me could very well be a con for you and likewise, so i'm just going to give my thoughts on it.

The game is an amazing time-sink...if you have friends who also play it, while surviving in the game can be done Solo as well as co-op, you're probably going to only get so many kicks doing it solo before you get sick of constantly being killed while growing your dino.

Apart from some select servers that you have to sign up to and earn points with to start with an instantly fully grown dino, you do have to grow it yourself...again fun if you're not playing alone but boring as all fuck if solo, especially if you're wanting to be the big bad on your server. Growth of a dino can range from an hour up to 8 hours give or take and in that time you are vulnerable to almost everyone.

The graphics for the dinos are good...for the time it was released although other games of the like still pale, the game mechanics are pretty standard...left click and right click to attack, E to eat and drink etc...

The Party system is crap, you can only truly party with your own species having to rely on common sense to not kill allies of others, all you get is a name plate on top of your allies head and a party chat (the party chat is great but when you speak in this game via chat boxes, no matter the box, your dino will be heard vocally by anyone in the surrounding area) it's basic and unfinished.

The game is just dinos, not a big selection either and all pretty much the same with different skins, you will almost never play herbivore because people lack the common sense to group properly or fight off carnivores...so that just leaves carnivores, too many of them in one group you all start to starve. You will only go a certain selection of dinos because of stats min-maxing, it's just how it is.

The devs teased and continuously said there would be Humans in the game...there is still a grey'd out selection for them in the character creation (character creation is old and basic) and to this day have not been implemented.

POSSIBLE FUTURE

The new version they are developing which took them years and will probably take them another decade to remotely finish is much better, lacking dinos but expected this early in development, I would say if you are looking to play a  decent dino survival sim...play the Evrima version of this game, otherwise...just don't play it.

"
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"So much time wasted on this game, only because I wanted to be a dino... Luckily, there are better alternatives out there nowadays. With actual development and nice devs, too!

The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I came here from SovietWomble, and the video was more entertaining the than the actual game. The core gameplay loop is walking back and forth between food and water and occasionally running from things if you're a herbivore, chasing things then going back and forth from your kill to water if you're a carnivore. THAT'S IT. It has good graphics and the game is beatiful, wallpaper beatiful I mean. But do the looks redeem the gameplay? No! Of course not! So far I've played for six hours, and I have had my good moments. Sorry, moment. That was when I was hiding from a carnosaur and I heard him stomp right by me. That was a fun and cool moment, but something even CLOSE to that hasn't happened yet, and I'd be surprised if it does. Maybe I'm just not playing the game right, or on bad servers, but for me it has been nothing but boring. If you're crazy enough to buy this game (or already have and can't refund it) then always keep another tab open so you can watch a 10 minute video on youtube that is 10 more times entertaining than this game is. Oh, and for anyone wondering I beleive the name of the server I played on was called Noobz. I forgot to mention that I kinda like being the underdog in games. Here, the underdogs are the herbivores. I expected playing herbivores to be something like travelling in a pack, running from predators, and if you watch videos on youtube (ex. The Gaming Beaver) that's what it is. Travelling in huge herds, of all sorts of herbivores and maybe even sometimes carnivores! If you try to play herbivore in The Isle and try to find a herd, you'll spend most of that session trying to find another herbivore- forget trying to find one that's whichever species you picked. Oh, and I should also mention that other members of your species are how you make a group, which I believe shows your nametags. Y'know, how you'd find eachother without giving away your meet spot away to the entire 125 other players on the server because you need global chat to talk to eachother, and proximity chat is proximity (obviously). Before I joined a family gallimimuses on my lone journeys I only found not 5, not 6, not 7, but 1 other herbivore that wasn't a bot. Yes, one. At least 95% of other players you see will be carnivores. I thought The Isle would do something like put limits on however many people could be this certain dinosaur but apparently not."

Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,Escape from tarkov but without the same level of annoyance when u die
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,Good game but it lacks content. It's fun for a while then gets stale and repetitive.

Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,dayz but new
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,"In a year there hasn't been any good updates, feels the same as on release and the world still feels empty."
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,I don't recommend this game to people just because of the issues I have had with trying to have fun with the game. I have played on a few servers that had a lot of people on them but the server died really quickly and left it with just me on it for weeks. If you try and play on populated servers like US 300 you will not be able to get any gear right away and will spend hours just trying to get a full kit. People on any server I have been on all call you racist things because you killed them or got the jump on them and they lost their gear. Now the main reason why I don't recommend this game is IT IS A RUNNING SIMULATOR!! You will spend 5 min running from one place to another just to fill your inventory and have to run back to safe zone or your base. Also the AI in this game are just ridiculously hard when you are just starting out. Now in order to get better gear in this game you really can only do pve content as spending money will take hundreds of thousands just to get the 2nd best tier of gear. Now unless you like playing on dead servers there is no fun really and when you play on any server that has people on it its only like 3 servers AT MOST that have anyone on them and they are almost always full. Now this game does have plenty of potential but the devs are TERRIBLE at posting content and take months to get anything out.If they could pump out stuff faster instead of working on stuff that doesn't matter in the game this could easily be a DayZ killer but it will never be at this rate with 3 updates since launch over a year ago
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,great game tons of potential def worth a buy. hours of fun solo or with a group
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,Excellent game a bit long between updates but they are quality and little to no bugs caused by them. Thanks devs keep up the hard work.
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,Playing for a year has been worth it when you see and hear what's in store as we get nearer to full release.
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,Nothing is updated nothing works the systems are broken and base building is impossible without a macro. Couldnt refund because it took me about 40 hours to finish my first base as a solo player just to realize there is no point and bases dont do squat. The PvP isnt bad when you dont get swamped by a 7 man team but even then if you die just run back there is no downside just keep spawning and running back. Unless you dont have dogtags then u spawn 3 miles away with no vehicles in the game. The PvE is just bad the AI are terrible and the loot system is trash.
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,Where Devs ?
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,no content like literally nothing
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,"Imagine if looter/shooter games didn't have arena-style space & time restrictions, and if PvP survival games didn't try to create the illusion of depth through time sinks. Then, you are imagining something like Deadside. It's like PUBG without the circle, Tarkov without the sweatiness, DayZ without the loathing. It's good."

Literally pay 11USD per month and you can reign supreme on 50 players daily. It's so easy. Do not trust this game to be able to give its vanilla experience until its able to solve its cheater problem. Right now, only underpopulated private servers with active admins are able to prevent the cheater problem. On official servers, players have collects days worth of video data to have a chance to having the devs to ban the cheaters. Even then, the cheaters often create new accounts for just 11USD. Man, I'm so tempted to just download cheats to fight the cheaters because the devs are not able to  guarantee a hacker free experience. Buying cheats in this game is just too easy without the possibility of getting banned."

But started with and progresses with a fraction of what they did."
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,"Concept and gameplay mechanics are cool and fun however, the NPC's can see through trees and bushes. Higher level NPC's seem to never miss. Character redning is poor so you cannot see enemies in the terrain. Overall, needs a lot more work until its playable."
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,"This game is cool. There are things about it I like more than Rust. But if you're deciding between the two, go with Rust. The servers are pretty dead. Doesn't seem like a huge player base. Sad because I think with packed servers this game would be a blast. I have fun when I play it but it seems a little empty. Even with it now being double the price of this game, Rust is still much more worth it. Not just trying to plug rust here but it's just basically in the same vein and is much more fun."
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,"Like Dayz but much faster paced and fun, AI bandits/mission, safezones, and base building."

Hope it gets good in updates, but it does nothing unique, and nothing fun that other games do better."
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,i really like this game but my opinion is DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME> As the game name suggests it is dead..  this game will never make it out of beta they are too slow at creating the content needed. expect a update that might come 12 months after they announce it
Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,OK first a super toxic chat if u buy this i recommend you play on a private server cause cheaters are drawn to this game like a moth to a flame they need to ban the cheaters it is really bad but at first it don't bother you cause its super easy to get gear and actually play the game till you get head shotted from 400M away with a ttk pistol with 1 shot or the fact that people build bases that have a sniper tower over looking a zone where mostly new players loot its fun but the b.s builds up really fast and if u die and say good kill they will most likely call u a all kinds of names and then roast you in chat its literally a 12 year-old chat room simulator
DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,454650,"Very Very fun Dragon Ball game in general, super addictive, been playing since beta of first Xenoverse game and can't tell you how many times I've repurchased the dlc for different platforms. But there is always going to be one thing that holds this game back and that's the fact that once in a blue moon you'll find someone playing something PvE wise online. I still actively play this and, be still my heart, get excited unlocking something for a character that people have had for a long time. This game used to be so exciting whenever the PvE scene was as active as the PvP scene and even in that category it's filled with cheesers who abuse namekian grabs and CC chain lock abilities making it unfun as well. Hoping that in this next expansion this game will see some light and hopefully as well get some community love. But until then, if you're a first time buyer, I would not recommend unless you have some friends to play with who will be just as active as you are due to the pricing. So if you're looking for help in grinding something or wanting to do things in PvE, feel free to add me and message me and I would gladly come and participate!"
DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,454650,"TL;DR: The game is fun if you are a dragon ball fan, but I'd play it with friends if you can. Also, wait for sales if you care about the dlc, otherwise play it for what it's worth. 

I've played this game so much across so many platforms that I can tell you pretty much anything about this game.
I will tell you outright that you will only enjoy this game if you are a fairly big fan of dragon ball. Even then, the game will absolutely test your patience at times. There are straight up BAD parts of this game. That being said, because I am a gigantic dragon ball fan I absolutely love it. 

If you're looking to scratch that itch of playing a dragon ball game that feels similar to games from the budokai tenkaichi or raging blast series' then this is the game. It's not really all that complex to play, but you feel like you're a dragon ball character (which is especially cool since you get to make your own character as well). It's not really a *fighting* game, so don't expect FighterZ level complexity (also a dope game). 

The main draw this game has on me (besides being a dragon ball game) is honestly being able to play with friends. It has plenty of PVE stuff for you to do in the form of the hundred or so parallel quests (which can also be added to with dlc). It's got that large character roster that you'd expect from the aforementioned games (though the characters also aren't all 100% unique).

The biggest negative from this game is more so the business side instead of the game side. The game is expensive as fuck. It's 5 years old still basically full priced, and it contains so many dlc packs that enhance the life of the game. If you want EVERYTHING the game can offer, the dlc is *kind of* necessary. I say it's kind of necessary because at a point you just become so damn strong that most of the missions become chump change, and the dlc quests that are added are notoriously hard as dicks. You can pass on the dlc if you don't really care about any of the characters they add/want new missions. If you want the COMPLETE game, I highly suggest waiting until the game is under $10 with special pricing on the dlc. I bought the game as gift for a friend recently and with EVERYTHING it was about the same price as the base game normally is. 

The other really annoying business side of the game is that it does have some F2P game mechanics. There is an in-game currency that allows to get clothes, skills, etc. You don't have to pay any of it, but I find it frustrating that they have these predatory business practices in a game that you could very well be paying over $100 for (base game and all the dlc packs.)

Overall, it's a game I find myself getting sucked back into time and time again. 

Plus, you can dress up as Mr. Satan while being a SSJB shooting a big bang attack, and I think there's something beautiful about that.

Y e s.

I highly recommend this game."
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"Shakes and Fidget is a free to play animated web browser RPG with asynchronous multiplayer and everything RNG.  It is an international web browser and mobile game, so it will be populated with many other players. This game is translated into many languages, so there will be many Non-English reading players.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok, was understandable.  It is light on resources used, so it will be runnable on any computer.

Has funny quest text and gear descriptions.  The artwork is cartoony and funny. Has varied weapon sounds. Has some animation.  Has a manual and official wiki in English.  Pretty Easy to play.  

The level cap is 600, but it will take you long time to reach it, very TIME consuming game.  (At my current hours, i have a 144 scout and 135 warrior)  Quests and other things take an amount of real time to complete or cooldown reset.  More time you put into it, the higher you climb on the leaderboard.

Mushrooms are the store currency, but you can earn some from quests rewards and gambling.   Some gear cost mushrooms, but you might find the same and better later for gold only or quest reward.   You can spend mushrooms to skip waiting on timers or add time to questing endurance and the best mount.   There is hourglasses that you can buy with gold for skipping the travel time on questing.

It has PVP and PVE.  It is RNG combat where better stats and gear will give you some edge, but RNG is a fickle goddess, you still can lose to bad rolls. Difference in Level between you and target is a factor of success. You can make 2 characters per accont, picking one of 4 classes ( warrior, mage, scout, assassin).  Has an PVP Arena where you have a choice of 3 players to attack for gold, honor and xp.

You can raise your all your stats with gold and use potions to temporary improve a stat.   Gear you can buy or get from quests can now be modded in the blacksmith shop and in the tavern watercloset. At level 75, you can collect Pets that improve your stats and you can fight other players pets. There are many other things that you can do to improve your stats.  

It has 31 dungeons you can unlock and raid.    Finishing Frost Blood Temple Dungeon, you unlock The Tower which gives you three companions (Mage, Scout, Warrior) to raid with through 15 harder dungeons that unlock with the Tower.  You have to outfit your three companions with gear to improve their stats.  But ends up having to wait for your level to catch up to the dungeon level.

You can make your own fortress, with some buildings that improve your character and other building for protecting your fort or raiding others forts.  You can raid other players forts for resources and pour your gold in to defending your fort.  There is an Underworld that you can build and other players can raid. It has Guilds and guild wars, where guild members all attack other guilds or defend from other guild's attacks.  Guilds have stuff they can build that increases gold and xp gain for guild members.  But above level 25 guild upgrades require someone that Buys mushrooms.  You can increase your guild level also by completing guild house raids. 

The 22 plus servers are located in Europe somewhere (Central Europe time zone).  Devs keep adding more servers, which pulls active players from the established servers.  Leading a guild is easy but hard to get enough active dedicated players to reach the very top of the guild leaderboard.    

Try it, maybe you might like it.  You can play this game for free, and it keeps you busy several hours a day.

Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"[h1]Intro[/h1]
Played this for about 7 years now.

This is like a diablo game without having to do the grinding manually.

Instead, you send out your character on a quest using your limited energy per day, have the game running in the background and when it's done, you collect your xp/gold/whatever else dropped. Even the battles (there's one at the end of each quest for example) are automated and you can choose to skip them (they are decided by stats and some randomness - blocking, dodging, critical attacks, damage ranges etc.).

[h1]Warning[/h1]
This game is pay to win. But at the same time, I'm actually not bothered by this. Let me explain. In this game, there is a currency called mushrooms. You can actually get these randomly for free, but not enough to buy all the extra energy you can each day. More energy means you can do more quests and if you can do more quests per day, you will level up and increase your attributes faster. But you also have to put more time into it. The energy you are given is enough to take a couple hours each day (of course, again, mostly having the game running in the background while doing something else), so even if I could, I definitely wouldn't spend more time than that every day. That would just burn me out.

Also, the progression of others might as well be irrelevant to you if you're not too bothered about leaderboards. There are plenty of other things to do in this game other than straight up pvp.

The other uses of mushrooms aren't all that important and don't really give much of an edge in pvp.

As a last note, there is a special ""donatable"" version of mushrooms, which are needed to donate to a guild. There didn't use to be, but now there is a way to get these for free as well (though the regular drops don't count). I would assume (seeing as I have over 360 of these myself), that if everyone in a guild chips in with these, this isn't an issue at all.

[h1]Notable pros[/h1]
+ Over the years, the game received and continues to receive big updates. I'm talking entirely new features that add more and more layers of what you can actually do in this game, like the fortress (building a base, attacking other people's bases = new leaderboard entirely), pets (which you have to find first, you level them up and use to fight other people's pets), etc. Usually I'm just content doing my grinding and progressing dungeons and other stuff, but whenever one of these is announced, I'm legitimately excited.

+ You can play it on your phone (using your PC account), so that you don't miss your day's grinding if you're away or something. Or there's also the browser version, which came originally, for when you don't want your friends to know you play this and stop talking to you (jk).

+ No limits. Technically, there is a level cap (500), but I don't think anyone in the world hit that yet and it could get increased like it did once (I play on one of the oldest servers). You can increase your stats for gold to infinity, get better equipment, gems, etc. Basically, there really isn't an endgame to this. The dungeons and bosses in these are static, not randomly generated btw. and I think nobody has beaten them all yet. There's always some next challange you're looking to beat.

[h1]Notable cons[/h1]
- P2W (see Warning section for more explanation) - you're gonna hit that top 10 pvp leaderboard only if you have more money and time than god. Even if you don't care about that, you're going to progress dungeons slower.

- This game is repetitive. Duh. Like every game about grinding. You're gonna do your set of daily chores (and by now there's a lot, but you can do them simultaneously - while questing, spin that wheel of fortune, get those arena and pet battles done etc.) and then usually be glad that's done."
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"Seeing the game has rather positive ratings I decided to look into. After spending almost hour I still have no idea where is the game. 

As the guy said, positive reviews are paid off with in-game currency. The game? No such thing here. Really guys, just pass over."
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"Fun for the first couple hours, but it seems that to even get to the point where you can do dungeons, it would take at least 8 hours of doing click-and-wait missions."
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"It's pay to win, repetitive, and kind of like an idle game. Not that interesting"
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"This isn't an rpg.  There is no story, it's just a time wasting idler.  You can find better things on kongregate."
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,Played it a bit. It's ok.
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"This game is really bad, first off...Mages are rediculously OP, I played as one and destroyed my opponents that were 2x my lvl, I also played a fighter and was destroyed by mages EVERY TIME...If my arena choices were all mages, I could not beat any of them. The pvp system pits you constantly against higher lvl opponents..my mage was fine at lvl 6 beating lvl 12 opponents, my fighter never stood a chance vs mages.. Second of all if you run out of the ""thist for adventure meter"", which allows you to do quest, it does NOT regen on it's own..you HAVE to spend thier ""mushroom"" currency to refill it.. if you run out of mushrooms and exaust your questing meter and do not want to pay $ for mushrooms to play the game, it is literally done for you.  The combat system is lame and is just a take turns hitting each other system, there is no strategy involved at all...the point of a mage is that yea, you do lots of damage, but if you get hit it's really bad for you right?... Not in this game.. There is literally no benifit or hinderence to being a subposed ""ranged"" character because you just take turns hitting each other so the bigger dps wins most of the time if they just put a few points into HP.. example..my lvl 6 mage with 587 hp beat a lvl 9 fighter with over 2800 HP by criting him for over 1380 dmg..The translation from German is really bad.. the manual on how to play is writen in German.  You as a player have no idea how to unlock the dungeons because the tooltips do not tell you how.  The game could be so much more, but it's just really bad in the state it is in.. Don't waste your time on this one."
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"A time consumer, and a wasteful one at that. Not worth it.


EDIT: I just found out that the creators were paying off people to provide this sack of shit game with positive reviews. There is absolutley no game here whatsoever. You can't even call this a goddamn clicker game because it lacks any sort of goal. In order for a video game to be a clear and precise video game is that it needs to kow what it's doing. Shakes and Fidget does the opposite of that. It may be entertaining for the first hour but then you have to start waiting longer and longer to do the dungeons it just gets frustrating. Do not even consider downloading this game, it's not worth your time."

Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"I've played this idle game for a year now. This is not really a game. You just do quests, grind, and wait. Tactics and strategies are very limited. It could be a hell of a battlefield with a few changes, but it is only relaxing. Whether you win or loose, it is the same. This game sets up ""routine checks"" throughout your IRL days."
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"A fun, addictive web browser type game for people who like sense of constant progression towards a irelevant goal, boot the game, select an action, close the game, return later on, you've progressed and/or get something out of said action,rinse and repeat, it rewards you for tedious things but that's not always something bad, it's something i quite enjoy in these games."

Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"It may be hard to understand what is so good about it, but this game is good.
It is casual. It's very casual. It is a model of a casual game that does not bother you to 'achieve' and yet you feel satisfied with your achievements. 
All those funny pictures and humorous quirks are not the game's main asset. The best thing about it is that it is easy, it helps you to relax and take a break from other challenging games.
Many players quit it. I played a couple of hours to find out my character is stronger than 76% of players. That means many early quitters. 
I believe, most players quit ""Shakes and Fidget"" after first couple of days while finding it ""too slow"". 
If you have an urge to quit it too, think again. The problem is not in this game, the problem is in you. You are in a rush. This game rewards you for not being in a rush.
Enjoy it as you enjoy a nice cup of tea or an afternoon nap, You will feel good about it."

Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"★★★★☆

One of the better mobile games ported to Steam.

Pokes fun at common MMO motifs.

Complete afk-style timed quests that give your chosen hero xp, gear, gold, etc.
Join a guild and participate in afk-style guild-vs-guild fights and climb the guild leader board.
Compete in auto-attack duels against other players and climb a duel leader board.

Overall, winning relies heavily on time gated quests, joining the newest server is advised.

Fairly pay to win but still enjoyable as a f2p imo."
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,Nice game....
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,Very good 5 hubičiek for free
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"*****IF you expect deep insight into the game don't bother, I'm not sure as far as spoilers go in games without stories but minor spoilers included (probably)****

Well first of all I was motivated to write this review(my first) by a promise of 5 mushrooms (in game currency)... (although it did say rate, so maybe I'm mistaken, think I got the mushroms though so I'll be a good sport and write something) *edit* here I would like to say that 5 in game currency is not much and the review is not positive because of this, it is positive because i really like this game hence the 55h+ game time*

First glance, I like this game, it's nice, it's casual and it helps me relax (except when it frustrates me, but it doesn't do it often so it's ok, trust me). The main components are questing (gold and exp grinding with a touch of gear drops), the dungeons (challenging oponents that make all the grind worth it), and pvp fights (for honor&glory, with honor determining the position in the rankings, I made up the glory part). There is the guild feature which allows you to socialize with different players and has it's own rewards. At this point I haven't accessed the full features of the game(castle and pets) so I can't say much about them. 
It's basically every rpg once you passed the main story and have only the grinding part left, except, here you don't have to actually run around the map, find distant areas, kill swarms of monsters, or push a lot of buttons. 

To keep the spoilers minimal, the initial progress is a bit slow but it gets fun and exciting afterwards. The quests don't require a lot of attention and I like this type of games since they can be played in the background(usually in the mornings when my brain is still booting). The in-game currency can be purchased but it is also obtainable from questing and other sources so it doesn't make such an great impact. I don't believe this to be an play for free but pay to win type of game since paying will mostly just speed things up but will not give you unbelievable boosts, and I don't feel like I'm missing out on alot for not paying (although maybe you should ask me on that in a few weeks from now when i get to levels where waiting is frustrating). As for that, quests have time durations and you can basically sit back and fiddle your fingers while the time doesn't run out. So if you are impatient types maybe this game is not for you. 
Battles are instantanious and while you do not actively participate i found the waiting and anticipation thrilling, especially when you are on your death door and hope the next hit will be a crit for win...

I do not have a lot of negative stuff to say, because the concept of the game is simple enough and at this point it has not let me down, I'm looking forward to the new stuff and features (level unlockable) and hope it will not let me down. Maybe a background story would be nice but then again I'm grinding clicker heroes so what do I know.

I am not a Chinese robot paid to write this review

Also I'll probably regret not reading it before posting, but the bed awaits and to parafraze what a ""wise"" man i know once told me, sleep is good!"
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"Easy to start and funny at times, the graphics are well drawn. It is a great game to play if you have free time and want to potter about with something."

Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,Absolutely addicted to this game! It's been a while since I've found a game that would keep my attention (and I used to be an avid gamer)
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,how have i spent over 2 days on this. send help
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"Yes, as stated in other reviews the game rewards you for reviewing it. I hope it doesn't notice this review as I rather not take advantage of that ?feature?. I find the game to be rather good. It has its glaring issues. The fact they think rewarding someone for leaving a good review is a good idea is just one of them. 

It has the sense of being a mp game. Though there is little actual player interaction possible. I enjoy the small level that is possible and find I interact with other players much more then I do in other games. Taking part in the pvp, guilds, etc. Which I skip in most the other online games I've played.

The pay model seems to be pay for convenience. As all I have seen that they accept realy world money for is to buy a currency in game called mushrooms. Mushrooms are given in game as well. There are even weekend events where every other quest rewards randomly adds a mushroom. The mushroom can be used various ways in game. Though the game has other currencies that it uses for things. Mushrooms don't replace those currencies. They might be added to them though, from time to time. There are a few things that can only be purchased with mushrooms. From what I have seen though those can all be gotten just by not playing the game for a extended period of time. As timers will take into account when the game is not running that is a valid option that I find myself using often.

It is best to play it while doing something else. As much of the game  involves waiting to be able to commit another action. I tend to play it while watching videos or playing other games that take waiting on.

The biggest issue I have with ""Shakes and Fidget"" is the stamina system. It seemes like I could do a ton of quest per day before I was worn out for that day when I was a low level. Now I am only level fourteen and can barely do a handful of quests before my stamina bar depletes. The only way I have found to refill the bar is to use mushrooms to regain a little stamina. That has a hard limit too. I can only use ten mushrooms a day for regaining stamina. Which means for the longest section of day I can't do quests.

Overall I find it to be worth playing. I strongly recomend it to people that have very little ""free"" time. Especially if they are able to play this while they are doing other things they need to do."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"First major concern a lot of people have about LOTRO - is it dead?

No. It still has a very healthy playerbase, big enough that the even the RP servers feel populated. So don't let your worries about population turn you away.

This is a classic MMORPG. It's going to be familiar to anyone that has played Everquest, DAoC, WoW, etc. While it means you're not getting any particularly amazing new mechanics, the perk is that LOTRO has figured out how to get the best out of those systems. Leveling feels well-progressed, classes are (mostly) balanced, and there is a lot of variety even within the classes to provide lots of replay value and ways to mitigate strengths and weaknesses.

LOTRO might have the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I recommend turning off battle music and just enjoying the compositions. Bree, as well as the various Inns and Halls located therein, have some fantastic scores attached to them.

Let's be honest though - if you play LOTRO you're probably here because it's Lord of the Rings. And in that regard, you will not be disappointed. The game is steeped in the lore - books and films - and has little nods to it scattered everywhere that are rewarding for someone that is really into their Tolkien scholarship. This is not a LotR skin thrown over a MMORPG framework - this is Middle Earth proper. Even with dated graphics (updates are coming soon, as of this writing) it's still a joy to look at. If you're rolling through some place like the Shire, you'll be able to soak in that sleepy, bucolic atmosphere that the movies portrayed so well.

This is a great MMO experience, and I usually find MMOs tedious. Moreover, it's free - so your excuses to at least try it out are non-existent."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"The steam client is trash.

[b] BUT [/b]

The game is amazing, It looks stunning for a game that came out when it did and the newer areas show the love the developers have put into the game, I dont use the steam client though because it has caused me some issues.

PROS:
[list]
[*] Follows LOTR lore almost perfectly
[*] Classes are varied
[*] Community is always friendly
[*] THE MUSIC SYSTEM! Its so good. You can either play by hand or use .abc & .midi files to play instruments in game!
[/list]

CONS:
[list]
[*] Quests are boring if you dont read the quest text, They seem to have no point unless you dive into the story
[*] Difficult to start if your not a ""VIP"" member. Dont let this put you off! you can get everything legitimatley without paying a dime!
[/list]"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Love this game. Been playing it for many years. It's really remarkable. Definitely the best 'escape' game out there. Music is really chill, the world and art is beautiful and the gameplay is fairly easy going.

My only complaint about it is that after so many years, it can get a little repetitive but that's mostly my fault for playing it so much. There is quite a bit of grinding involved, but it's mostly enjoyable and there's so much variety in the game that you can change gears all the time and keep yourself engaged in countless activities."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Still one of the most most immersive and fun MMORPGs. Also the most gentle freemium model that I have seen. Older graphics. Great music. Fellowships. Kinships. Houses. Dungeons and quests.
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I have been playing this game from Alpha stage, granted it is older graphics but not the worst out there. Many many hours of gameplay to be head with fantastic content if your a fan of the Movies, Books, etc. then give it a try. I personally love the game and the community is one of the best I have seen."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I love to play this game just to unwind and take in the scenary of Middle-Earth. It's a great game to play with friends or also alone. It's free-to-play but there is content blocked by a pay wall. Technically, you can get past the pay wall by just playing the game but it's a monotonous grind. I listen to the ""LOTRO Podcast"" while playing this game and it's really relaxing. Overall, highly recommended."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"This is probably one of my favorite things to review...as you can tell by my hours..198.8 hours total, BUT I have 64.9 Hours just in two weeks, thats how addicting this game can be, that is with no sitting around, no afking or etc..it's a very fun game..But with the fanboying aside lets get to what you guys came for and give my Pros and Cons

Pros:
Great Community (very helpful no matter what server your on)
Beautiful Atmosphere
Never breaks the tolkien universe feeling (which means always feels like your really in the Tolkien Universe) 
Great Variety in Weapons, skill sets, and armors, you will rarely find someone with the same kind of armor and or weapon as you or even close for that matter
Very Unique in its own way, personally I love the cosmetic system, it adds this feeling to kind of drive you into the universe more so you can kinda be more in character, feel like your there (Cosmetic system, allows you to equip armor and weapons that you would personally think suits you, so for man it would be ranger armor and etc, dwarves heavy dwarven armor and etc...Personally it a great feature as it gives a better feeling to it) 
Teams still working on the game, making it much better with every update!
Added a new race called Beorning with the class (their like druids, for WoW players you turn into a bear pretty much lol) But also hard to get on free to play..but possible!
Has own servers for Roleplayers (so if your into kind of the Tolkien universe for LOTR that you know a lot about roleplaying and stuff give it a shot, people are very forgiving on Laurelin (the EU and US RP server) along with other servers as well.
Has some wonderfu crafting mechanics that could very much benefit you if you are in a Kinship (kind of like a clan) you can help each other have the gear you need to FIGHT For middle earth!

Cons:
Sadly, helps the VIP a lot, with all expansions and etc unlocked
F2P's have to ""farm"" all their points in order to level
F2P's have a huge grind
Sometimes you could be looked down upon from being a f2p by VIP's (more my personal experience but still, something to be careful about)
Time Consuming farming (not too much of a complaint as that's how its suppose to be XD)
Graphics for character are out of date (expected of course from 2009)
Some areas can be depressing yes, but that DOESN'T mean its still not beautiful, you could be taken away by the beautiful areas around Angmar, or the huge mountains in Moria or just in the Misty Mountains great places to go (harder to get to if your F2P, trust me..I farmed the points, tough but worth it) 

These are of course my personal Pros and Cons, as you would expect, but most of them were based off of other people's reactions to the game and stuff like that, so it is not just me spewing a bunch of stuff out for someone to read :P I hoped you loved the review, and trust me I'd gladly give it a 10/10 course it has its flaws but it is still beautiful, fun, and interesting.

And always remember....Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! (which means...Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!) Sorry i'm a dwarf Junkie myself! :P I love dwarves and their history in the Tolkien universe."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"to steam dev.
the downloadable content from steam is too outdated, please update your  game, so steam dont refuse our updated version and delete it then try to re-download the outdated content from your servers"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"10 years and still fascinating millions of people world wide. Lotro is right behind WoW and Everquest in long time popularity. For good reasons. The community loves Tolkiens world and they treat eachother with respect and open arms. The most important game in my long history of gaming - an MMO legend you should not miss if you are interested in Middle Earth and its tales. What Peter JAckson did for the books in the movie world, Turbine the developer did for the gaming world. A beautiful and surprisingly accurate depiction of the books and scriptures of JRR Tolkien. A timeless Art Direction makes the game still look relevant today. 
Join the greatest Fantasy Universe ever imagined."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Lotro's graphics maybe somewhat dated at the moment and mechanically it does not stand out to much from other mmos using the same model, but the game does justice to the breadth and scope of Middle Earth and Tolkien's deep lore. I recommend this game to people who value small ambient touches in a game over wow factor and of course to any readers of the Professor."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Great MMO that's actually totally F2P if you don't mind farming special currency.
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"If you're a Tolkien fan, you should love this. It's a lot of fun seeing how much care and attention has gone into recreating the world of middle earth. 
As an MMO, it is one of the best ones out. It is certainly more geared to solo players, but does a good job of catering to everyone. The classes range from basic to some of the most advanced and interesting classes I've ever seen in an MMO. (Take Warden or LoreMaster for example)! The community is also one of the friendliest and the servers are still busy and alive to this day. It has stood the test of time and still looks astonishingly beautiful as ever. Add to all that it has fantastic mood setting music you've got a class A product. Many players simply can't stop at a single character and over the years I have kept on coming back to this game. Without a doubt my favourite MMO ever. It's also great to see the dedication of Standing Stone in keeping their work alive and keeping lotro safe for the future years with a decent, not overly greedy free to play system. Much of the content can be enjoyed for free and extras can be bought as required. The only time you may consider spending money is to open up quest packs in different regions and expansion packs. But considering the size and amount of time you could foreseeably spend in this masterpiece, it is well worth it!"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"My playtime should say enough.
"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I present you the video passage of the game Lord of the Rings Online, more precisely, its main storyline, which is here proudly called ""epic"". Numerous side quests scattered throughout Middle-earth will not enter this passage, since for the most part they are tasks like ""kill 5 goblins"" or ""bring 10 wolf tails"" and, with rare exceptions, are not worthy of our attention. But the main storyline is very interesting and, most importantly, it very closely intersects with the plot of the books ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit."" We will meet a lot of familiar characters, take part in familiar events and how to properly ponostalgiruem.

I will make a reservation that this video passage was created in order to consider the plot of the game and compare it with the books ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"", and not run through the whole game, skipping past the description of the quests and doing endless shooting of monsters. Passage does not carry the main purpose of suggesting something to the players (although not without this, of course). Here, rather nostalgia, combined with the analysis of the plot and its connection with the original, untouched universe."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Fun game, although you feel kinda left out if you don't pay money into the game. It's not impossible to progress without money, but the game askes for it a lot. 

It's kinda a fun game without money, but recommened playing with friends or else it gets boring fast.

It has skill trees which is always fun in games. Archer is OP in 1v1's late game, I reccomened though!"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Best mmo and best gaming community I have ever encountered, how old the game is doesn't make it look bad at all, it makes it feel kind of special. Only bad thing is that the game has a bad tutorial. It is free to play but there is dlc.  U can buy them with a very rare in-game currency that takes a long time to get but most people buy most of them. PvP is Like no other game and amazing. U can play as orcs and spiders or the free people of middle earth, there is a big PvP region where there are out posts to capture that give buffs, castles that if defeated join your faction and give you quests, and an entire secret underground world filled with bosses, not to mention towns and mines to do quests and farm so u never even have to fight another player if you don't want to. You are going to want to work in groups of at least two though to survive, especially if u are low rank because there are high levels from the other faction roaming and npcs meant to fight groups of people."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"good game needs to sort out pvp it sucks in nearly 10 years they put a tree in game and added some mushrooms , come on
sort it
"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Old school game :)..
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Lets go to Mordor baby!!!!
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,This game has taken months off of my life and I still love it. IGN 10/10 for musical instruments. Plus you don't need to buy anything if ur a cheapo the horse riding trait is easily unlocked with deeds so don't give me that sh*t the only problem I have is the gold cap which I am working to take off.
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I just can't be sure anymore. For every step forward this game makes two steps back.

There's a suffocating lack of communication from developers. In some games, devs pat vets on the back. In other games, they feed the newbies. In yet other games, devs are milking donators. In this game, devs have no idea what they are doing and can't focus on a single direction to move the game in.

For a 10-year veteran like me playing this is pain. A pain I endure because I love this game. Read below to learn why I still do.

[h1]ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW[/h1]

Put it simple: the best MMORPG out there.

It's big. What do you think is big? WoW? Check this. If you pay attention, you'll notice that any other MMORPG uses either corridor-shaped locations, with the view in the distance always blocked by mountains, trees, buildings etc., or dramatically low draw distance, or both. Well, LotRO draws enormously vast locations with honest draw distance - not GTA V, but nothing like you've seen in MMORPG before. (The Crew was later). When you're in the fields of Rohan, you feel exactly why it is the land of horseriders.

It's authentic. I play this game for 7 years and still I stop and gaze in awe at dwarf lords sculptures in Moria. Still I take screenshots of The Shire. Still I find dozens of new landscape details. This world is handcrafted by the indigenous inhabitants of Middle-Earth - piece by piece, tree by tree, bush by bush.

It's homely. LotRO officially has the best or one of the best communities in online games.

You know, I can go down to the basic mechanics, the classes (see in comments), the raids, the PvP, the unique mechanics like Legendary Weapons and Mounted Combat, but you know what? It's boring. Every game has mechanics, classes, balance and lots of people whining there's no balance. But this game is special. It has heart.

It IS The Middle-Earth. If this means nothing to you, just pass by. You will like it, or dislike it, nothing I can change. But if you love Middle-Earth as I do, or if you are ready to fall in love with it, then we shall meet in White City, one day.

Over 4000 hours /played on Russian servers before they were shut down."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Played this game for way too long and way too many hours.
Great game, fab community, superb wiki resources and game mods. The game is largely free from bots, cheats, exploits and if a spammer rears its ugly head once a year (if even that...last I saw one was 2012), it's laughed out the door.

It's the theme park of theme parks, Lord of the Rings. Up to a couple of years ago, very down-to-earth and toned down graphics. Then WB games went medieval on the rear end of the game. In particular the store end of the game.

 Now you get deco pets (how about a rat the size of a horse or a shining spectral bear with a little snowstorm above it), silly character costumes and store enchants to rival many Asian micropayment grinders. Happily you can opt out of seeing any deco pets and if you see a bare-chested dwarf in purple tights running around town with a chicken nest on his head...so be it.
On the plus side, there is zero focus on lingerie. The female character game models are as sexless as plywood and the males look either goofy, mildly gay or just a little burly. It's toned down but rather outdated and promises of updates to the character game models have been made.

Typically, a micropayment game is aimed at making you pay and keep paying.
LOTRO is different. If you sub for just one month (that is USD 15), you gain permanent perks and upgrades to your account and your characters that will remain forever. This means that the paywall is nearly non-existant.
Technically you can grind and grind and utilize 99.99% of the features in the game and never whip out your wallet or add your credit card to the store. You can grind out in-game cash and you can grind out store points (example: quest area covering a certain amount of levels would cost 500 store points and you would have to spend 1-2 days dsolely grinding out store points to attain that amount).

Game cash can be used to buy certain store products from other gamers. This is the one recently added pay-to-win game store bias that rubs me the wrong way. The few and far-between botters could use botted game gold to shop regular lootable items before but the choice was limited. Now they can buy most of the useful store items.

Beef:
store stuff vs game gold as long as a gamer is willing to spend
somewhat dated character game models inside a rather lovely game
no apparent effort is made to delete botters or exploiters even if these are very few
not a game in maintenance mode but manned by a dwindling number of staff
yearly novelty features quickly abandoned
bad fishing (hey, I like good fishing in a game!)
rather boring pvp

Superb:
no gold sellers
no focus on lingerie or sexualized children
the lore is deep and to a large extent exact
great atmosphere and in-game muzak
mostly great community
superb external wiki resources for any little feature or thing in the game
great options and conveniences for everything...freely adjust game window, turn weapon glow on and off, show or hide pets, chat filter if wanted, creatable user defined chat channels and tabs, save UI settings for alts but can use entirely different ones, any keyboard command adjustable and little extras like searchable NPC stores, searchable options and so on...really well done
90% well-defined character classes not overlapping too much but not strictly trinity heal-tank-dps"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"If you are a Lotr fan, this game is a must. My favorite MMO out there
"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"There isn't enough I can say about this game. Being a huge Tolkien fan, this game gives me the sense of Middle-earth in a proper form. The classes are really fun and mostly balanced (certain unbalanced classes, though not unplayable are always getting fixed), the world is exciting and fun to level up through or just explore. The community is really helpful and are always ready to help someone in need. Crafting is great as well. Decorating your house was a really nice feature, but Standing Stone Games recently upgraded it and I haven't seen any other housing decorator system like it. To put it simply, it's amazing.

I think my playtime on this game will say otherwise since I can't say enough. If you're interest in picking it up, please, do yourself a favor and do it."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,The only and best MMO I play. 9years + from date of posting this!
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Amazing game!
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Edited review after realising I was wrong. The game may not be quite as pretty graphically as more modern ones, but this is more than made up for by the good story driven progression, light hearted fun and occasional humour."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,I was a cool dwarf
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"An excellently crafted, nostalgic treat for elder Scrolls fans and new players alike. The subtle changes that drag this classic game into 2016/17 are a pleasure to witness. Recommended for anyone who enjoys a sublime and immersive RPG experience"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Great game! Especially if you are a Tolkien fan. This game puts you into the stories.
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,omg i forgot about this game.... is it still active?
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,one of the best mmo out there
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,dank af game
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,what is to say? you're a fan of LOTR and you can be virtually in it. that's all I'm gonna say :)
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Just try this game out and see if you like it. It can be played for free and it's really decent MMO with that old school MMO feel.
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"An excellent game, yes it may be 10 years old or so but it can still hold its head high amongst the newer MMO games out there. FTP with its ingame shop but points spent in the shop can be bought for cash or grinding ingame so cash will speed things up but is not the be all and end all PTW that some games are. As it is free to play you can not go wrong with giving it a try, you never know, you may just like it."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Vey gud
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Great gamem, still has a big community.It looks amazing with the high quality texter pack for such an old game."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,it is like the best mmorpg game ive ever played i played it a lot on my old account and it was so fun. I 100% recoment this instead of WoW. 2 reasons why. 1st - its free hello......... 2nd - its free hello......
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Great game for fans (and non-fans) of the Lord of the Rings universe!
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,One of my fovourite games!
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Brilliant game. Played it at launch, great to be back."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Ai pup golt
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Love it   fun without the crazy cartoonishness of others
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I started to play this game back in 2007 when it came out (i wanted to try something different from WOW and GW so i started to play this with thoes 2). I remember then having problems with game (hard to start, game crash but when it worked it was OK).  So i managed to make som 1.5 k hours in it.  I got back to it when it came to steam - but only for 48h and that was too much.  After a long time i wanted to get back to this rubbish just to se whats happening now in it and i cant log in - - yes the old error 201. Something that bothers this game from its start. 

Now good sides of the game:
Good graphic
Lots of quest
Nice in game music
F2P & VIP  (deppends on player wishes)

Bad sides:
Bugs 
Gets boring after some times
And F2P screwd everything.

The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,it plays the lord of the rings soundtrack
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Awesome game just kinda exepsensive if yo wanna get far in the game but still good for free.
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"This game, is awesome as f!!!"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,I have osperhoterodhis oh noooo
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Really nice game...but...there many restrictions if you are VIP and even if you are VIP you still need LOTRO coins to buy even the instances (dungeons in other words). also you cant use the stable master to travel if you dont unlock the of course with LOTRO coins...the other thing i give this game  a thumb down is that with LOTRO coins you can buy equipment or upgrades that will help you and will improve your character...meaning its PAY TO WIN.
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"i like lord of the rings
"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,This game actually made me turn gay.
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,it is very confusing
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I tried to give this game a fair chance, but there are a couple of problems with it that make it impossible for me to recommend it.

1 - It claims to be Free To Play, but in the end it boils down to Pay To Win (aka Feemium). Anything worth having is on the LOTRO store for prices that make it impossible to get without paying real-world cash for the coins.

2 - This game is not for us who live in places where you still have to pay per megabyte of data, there are large ""updates"" every time the launcher starts. Looking at what is updating, I have to ask myself if I really need to be paying for different language loading screens.

3 - Now it's broken. The latest update seems to have broken my copy (at least), which probably means I'd have to delete the game files and re-download it if I wanted to play further (see point 2).

4 - I haven't really been paying much attention to world chat, but once or twice I noticed comments like ""if you don't want to be in a fellowship go find a single player game"" and ""if you want to quest alone go find a single player game"". A community that tells players to go away because they want to play a game in their own way is in trouble and heading toward becoming toxic."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I love LOTR, and the graphics in this game were not bad.  Game play wasn't even that bad.  Just had really bad issues staying connected and following the story-line."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Not good

You can't play the game without installing updates.""

WHY IS THERE AN OPTION OF YES OR NO WHEN I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT INSTALLING THEM EITHER WAY?! It's an illusion of choice and it is terrible. Now I have to sit through these 4K files to download before I play again."

The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"One of my favourite games of all time. What it might lack in exciting new systems or stunning graphics, it makes up for in its immersive story, its wonderfully realised world, and the simple pleasure of exploring Middle Earth at your own pace. The Shire is my happy place."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Easy to play and able to earn in-game currency so later game content is in reach.
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Best open world in gaming.
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I used to play it as non-steam game. It is really fun to play. I met many new friends there. I wish I could see the game earlier when it was released. Unfortunately I discovered it late but still even after all this years game is alive and well so even this only shows that game is worth trying. There are people who play this game only to walk and ride horse around middle earth and watch the views. But of course quests are amazing too. You should read the stories when you do questing ( especially main quests) There are different races and classes you can play with. Like Elf, High Elf, Beorning, Man, Hobbit, Dwarf and as classes Captain, Champion, Guardian, Burglar, Rune-Keeper, Lore-Master and so on. Each class has different kind of abilities and each are fun. I loved playing as Captain and Lore-Master. As a new player you can choose Champion cause it's easier to play with it I think."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"This game is awesome. Slow at first, but keeps with the story line."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"This game is fantastic, especially for how old it is. If you like Middle Earth/Tolkien and haven't tried this game out yet, you should. It may not be as fast paced as some other MMOs but it's a great game to play casually. Don't think of leveling as a grind or competition, just get lost and have fun. There is loads of content, it gets updated regularly, and most machines will run this on medium quality or better. I've taken long breaks from this game and keep coming back for the atmosphere. Highly recommend!

April 2020 Update:

The health of this game is still good once you get it running, but consider downloading the client from the game's website. The Steam installer fails to include Visual C++ and DirectX Runtimes. If you get the game from lotro.com, you will only have to deal with the latter. Here are links to the missing files if you need them:

-Visual C++ x86 & x64: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads

-Missing DirectX Runtimes: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35

If you are downloading the game on a laptop with NVIDIA graphics and the game crashes, the fix is to create a custom profile in NVIDIA's control panel -> program settings -> (select .exe for game) -> make ""High-Performance NVIDIA Processor"" the default.

Lastly, consider installing this on an SSD if you have one to reduce popping and stutter."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,ey this is good game i love it so much
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I think that the game is good, but the steam version is trash. Try the original version!"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,I enjoyed playing it but it wasn't working right on Windows 10.  Please offer Linux Mint version
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,why does it say patch dat files also its the best game ive played
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Love it and it still holds up to even the latest games pleas look at comments its well worth the money this game
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"just do it, itll make your dreams come true if youre a lotr fan and/or you enjoy plaing rpg's"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Note:I have played this game extensively on other clients, so I have a pretty good grasp of the game. 

LotRO is a fantastic game, but not always the best MMO. The game, while multiplayer and hosts a variety of features for guilds and group quests, is designed just as much for singleplayer. Many times it feels like you're all alone in this vast world. hunting monsters and finding resources. It's a fantastic game set in Middle Earth where you can enjoy yourself alone or with friends. I have many fond memories of fishing, questing, and exploring. 

The game is FTP, well, as much as any successful MMO can be. You can grind to get the in game currency you need to aquire DLC (all but the most expansive ones) and odds are you will be a bit willing to buy something if you enjoy it enough. You can even travel to many of these expansion areas just to see how they are, you just won't have access to the quests. I played for hundreds of hours without so much as spending a dime, it's fantastic. 

I reccomend this game to anyone who wants to live in Tolkien's epic fantasy, it doesn't get much better than this!"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I have played this game in the past and have been plating it on my cousins account because its so fun to play. If your wondering why i would play it on my cousins account its because my old pc broke a long time ago. But i still found this game fun but my problem now is trying to get it on this new pc is when it is loading those file type things in the beggining, not instaling but after, yah mine had like 9,700 of thos so i waited hours and when i came back it said error because i think i was gone too long but i dont know, itried this twice becuase the download would take a llong time then when it didnt work i just uninstalled it im trying it again because like i said its fun and i can play with my friends and cousons. Just wanted to say that, hope the game keeps going.
"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Just love this game, no matter how many time i left, i always come back to it, like for me its much better then WoW and other games of that type cuz of gameplay and options of making your champion unic, not like others that you got that wep with that stats and there is hard top get it, but if you do its the same like 100s of others weps, in here everything is made as you want/need it what give you option to make your hero as you want, not as game want it to be."

The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"If you want to have nerd panic attacks then this game is perfect. The endgame has died off more than I would like but if you like seeing iconic LOTR places like Rivendell,Mines of Moria,Lothlorien or even Bree then this game will be enjoyable for you"

Tower Unite,Massively%20Multiplayer,394690,"This is the game I exactly wanted. It is a party game without the shovelware, and it has the aspect of Second Life without the RP and sex cringe. This is the game I dream of having.

However, the game is in development hell, it been in develop for five years now, but, it been sticking it's guns to it since the very start, it isn't a development team that left their game half-finished with broken promises. I will happily watch this game grow and be completed to it's very end and see the community for it strive.

I also went out of my way to get a model just for this game alone."

Tower Unite,Massively%20Multiplayer,394690,"It pains me to say this after all this time, but as a day 1 purchaser, the dev team is just too slow. They haven't made nearly enough progress based on their promises, and even with the stuff they do release is usually very buggy. It's a fun experience with friends if you can catch it on sale, but once you play for about 20-30 hours the game starts to lack in content without grinding for very minuscule things. I hope to change this review eventually but I wouldn't be suprised at the pace they are going if they just stop progress altogether without actually finishing the game."

Tower Unite,Massively%20Multiplayer,394690,"Decided today after hitting 235 hours to finally give a review. 10/10 I have reached 235 hours in 4 months, nuff said. It would have been more except i work full time and was in school full time. I graduated and have more time to play!  That is how amazing this game is. I started playing on a laptop but it was super glitchy so I went to PC and its 100% better. I bought it for the golf and have rarely done the golf since there is soooo much good stuff to do in it. It's still in early access so there are some tweaks to be made but with all my early access games this one is the most updated. The devs put out a once a week update on discord what they have been working on that week and usually an update (a few a month). I love t his game and am so excited to see where it goes."

Tower Unite,Massively%20Multiplayer,394690,"My alarm clock peals out at 6AM on a Wednesday.

The disturbance rattles me into consciousness. I guess at some point I had to start wearing my reading glasses. I think my kidneys hurt and my mouth tastes of sour skittles but I can't seem to find an empty wrapper anywhere in my room.

On the stool to my right, Woody from Toy Story slams his hand down on the SPIN button on the Wheel of Fortune slot machine and looks up. I look up too. The wheel spins, slows, and stops on 20 units. Bummer. It doesn't phase Woody, though, who immediately begins pouring handfuls of coins right from his body into the machine before pulling down the lever anew. On my left, the car from Initial D follows the same routine.

I wonder if they have any clue how ridiculous they look.

Anyways, treasure just washed up on the beach and I've got enough time to grab some of that before Exodia hogs it all. But I'll have to be quick, I have a game of Super Monkey Ball scheduled with half of the cast of Guilty Gear, Todd Howard, and a walking emoji.

There's a lot to do, a lot of fun mini-games, the theater, the condos and the arcade, the arcade especially is extremely fun.

But here's my biggest problem with this game and why I honestly can't recommend it: The casino.

I understand that it's part of the game, but it got to a point where no one is anywhere except the casino, barely anyone is playing the games, or chilling at the arcade or the theater, or playing bowling or laser tag, everyone is just mindlessly gambling at the casino which honestly defeats the purpose of the game and pretty much turns it into a gambling simulator."
Tower Unite,Massively%20Multiplayer,394690,Minigolf is pretty good :>
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"This game has great potential and I would like to see it succeed but after nearly 400 hours of play time and several wars I can not in good conscience recommend the game in it's current state, although I wish I could.

There's simply far too many balance issues the developers don't seem to take very seriously and move very slowly to fix but by far the biggest issue the game has is the ability for literally one person with too much time and too much money to ruin entire wars for everyone by simply buying multiple accounts. Do they ban people if they get caught? Sometimes, sure, but it's not a solution to the actual problem and now they want to increase the price of the game in the near future? That's fucked up because they have no incentive to fix the actual issue which is the way the tech in the game works and people cheating makes them money and them making money off people who cheat gives them no incentive to fix it.

For example, you could buy and create a fresh account, join the opposing faction and just run around to the engineering centers, public refineries and public stockpiles and collect any of the tech materials that may be sitting there, grab them, and go drop them in a bush somewhere or in water which literally ruins the game for everyone but more so the faction it's being done to. People complain about it, report the person, the devs usually EVENTUALLY ban them but it doesn't solve anything because that person, if they have the money and devotion to being an asshat, can just rinse and repeat the process, but there's always several people doing it, on both sides, every war and it's simply not fun and dumb.

I also don't like how they manually change the tech trees between each war to however they see fit. I would much rather have both sides get the same static trees every war that allow the ability to tech whatever is possible for each faction and let the players decide what they want teched to use without the interference of devs because honestly they kinda suck at creating fair and balanced options.

For me personally those are the 2 most game breaking factors that make it not fun and make me unable to recommend it, but there are more. The stealing/cheating isn't limited to just tech materials, but literally anything that's not in a private stockpile. They can steal and destroy any vehicle that's just chilling or go to any bunker base and just withdraw and destroy any equipment sitting in them but the tech stealing/cheating has the greatest overall impact in my opinion.

I also don't enjoy anything in the game combat related and spend the time I do playing just doing logistical stuff because I absolutely hate that if you want to be effective and have an advantage you have to literally downgrade your aspect ratio to 4:3 and you just look and aim at the very corner of your screen.

The building in the game needs serious attention as well. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about it because it doesn't much matter until the other stuff is fixed, but I'll just say it's boring and tedious as fuck and I'm surprised that even a few people enjoy doing it but not surprised that there's always a ton of undefended areas across the entire map on both sides because it's simply not fun or enjoyable at all to the point it's not even worth learning how to do because it's just a chore.

1.) Fix the alt/cheating problem by reworking the entire tech system so it's not possible for 1 dedicated person to ruin the entire game let alone several people, and so that the devs don't profit from cheaters.

2.) Stop making up tech trees each war. Create and settle on static tech trees that provide the option for players to tech into what they want instead of adding/removing different weapons & vehicles every other war. It's dumb and it literally takes away content that we paid for.

3.) Change the way the camera works so combat is actually fun and fair. I don't like how if you move your mouse to the edge of the screen it extends your vision range. I think locking the screen in place like Diablo or Path of Exile would make combat feel more fair and fun with the exception of using binoculars, because you can't fire a weapon while using them anyway.

4.) Building needs serious attention. It's boring, a chore and not intuitive at all.

I recommend NOT buying the game until 1 & 2 are resolved because they majorly impact the game in a negative way, especially if they plan to increase the price of the game without resolving those issues. 

#3 is debatable and more of a personal preference thing I suppose, but as it stands I don't enjoy the combat and it leaves me perplexed on how others do.

#4 is irrelevant until 1 & 2 are fixed but building sucks.

Minor things that's aren't game breaking but would be very nice and welcomed quality of life changes would be more customization of regiments and squads and the ability to mark and draw out operation plans in game instead of having to take screenshots, edit them and use things like discord to set stuff up as well as the ability to regiment lock stuff as well as squad lock and include that locking ability to bunkers. 

 It would also be nice to be able to customize the chat box size, position, font, ability to create our own chat rooms ect. Think of World of Warcraft chat and put it in Foxhole and that would resolve that."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"I've driven many miles hauling supplies to the front. I've spent countless hours hunched in the drivers seat of a tank, waiting to be graced by the light of day and the order to drive forth and push the enemy back. I've watched from the trenches as a dozen men are slaughtered by a well placed artillery blast, and I'd do it all again."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Good stuff first. There's nothing like this game. The experience is truly unique at its best and this game has some of the best player interactions I've experienced. While it isn't for everyone, it feels really good to be one person in a sea of hundreds in one large battle.

However. This game has been greatly damaged by feature creep. The game now has asymmetric technology which means teams get different weapons and vehicles. This sounds fine in theory. But in practice it is hard to balance and the devs do not seem capable of balancing. You will see faction specific technology give one side a serious advantage resulting in several IRL days worth of unbearable gameplay before the roles switch and the other side gets stomped. This make the game annoying to play half the time and then pointless feeling the other half.

The game also sees devs meddling to prolong wars. This recent war, the devs added a 50 second respawn timer when we were making good progress. Then when we made another successful push, the devs added a 60 second respawn and kept it for 2 days until we were pushed back, even keeping it during low population. This killed any enthusiasm I had. It's clear the devs have ways to nudge the war in a direction they want, removing agency from the players.

I'd say keep your eye on this one if you're interested. Wait a year or two and take the criticism seriously. Even if you purchase now and enjoy it, you may find the devs change everything you liked about it."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"[TL;DR]
Game good! 

In Foxhole you will: 
Die from Bullets
Die from Shells
Die from Friendly Fire
Die from standing in front of a mortar
Die from being run over by a friendly truck
Die from being run over by a enemy vehicle
Die from Bayonet Charge
Die from Arty
Die from Gas
Die from Nades
Die from being shot in the back, while carrying too much. 
Die from drowning
Die from standing in front of an Anti Tank gun
Die from laughing your ass off

[in no particular order]

After 3 years, I returned to Foxhole to be amazed how it has changed in a very positive way. 

From playing a couple of hours and visiting different theaters of war, I firmly can conclude that Foxhole has reignited my attention.

I spent four hours fighting on a bridge and doing some Logi , which it seems boring, when in reality, it was actually really enjoyable experience. 

It seems that communication has improved a lot, although I do not like being not able to see Squad Members on the Map, or at least an indicator. This lead to a couple of frustrating moments, because as a Squad Lead there is no way to see where your squad members are??? But members see the leaders position...  I don't get that design choice, but oh well. Some glitchyness is still happening here and there, so be warned."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,Pretty fun game. If you like the concept of being a cog in a war fighting tooth and nail for victory over a large scale map i think you'll like this
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"There's a role for everyone because everything is done and made by players. Get lost in the sauce and have a chill time building and gathering or go to the front line and try to even survive. 
Deep strike into enemy territory if that's more your style, disrupt their supply lines and blow up whatever you can, or be a medic, a combat engineer, a base builder, a transport guy, make friends with local comms, etc.

Great game."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"TLDR: NOT recommended to solo players.

The game is brilliant; it's a great mix between real time strategy, top-down shooters and mmo persistent elements.

I'm not recommending this game to solo players though. The overall community is friendly, but a few rotten apples can really ruin your fun. The game is NOT solo player-friendly. ""Clan man bad"", is a meme in this game, and it rings very much truth. 

I knew this in advance as the game presents itself as a collaborative war effort; so I decided to play collaboratively - focusing on the most ingrate tasks (building & logistics). My experience left me with a bitter aftertaste: toxic behaviour, memes, constant complaining & bashing on the devs, and selfish clans wore me down in the end, so I'm leaving this with a negative judgement.

To the community still playing: most of you are great, but please be more mindful/caring for your solo players - especially the ones doing some of the heavy lifting."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,Take the time to try out the different playstyles before you judge this game. Logi is fun!
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Squads/Regiments/Clans, & players in general are pretty toxic. Will mass report you for your team efforts. Given how abused the reporting system is, I can not recommend the game no matter how good or bad it is. This is just unacceptable even at the price it is being sold. 

What did I do? I borrowed concrete to upgrade structures near the front line. 
So beware of the toxic 'Dogz' clan, among many other mass reports I have seen by other people/clans to other players just trying to enjoy the game, they will just straight up mass false report you for helping your team. The worst false report I heard was a guy reported & banned by the abusive report system just for placing a sandbag where someone did not want it to be. 

Just, I can not recommend this game with this report system in mind, you are better off putting your money elsewhere & playing something such as Company of Heroes instead of this game, you do not want to be around toxic players that ruin the community as a whole. The game is supposed to be fun & they take that away from you by abusing the reporting system. All I ever see is endless chatter of users being reported & banned for doing little to nothing, yet people board that abusive train & I unfortunately too was a victim & it really just makes me wonder why I paid for this game for this sort of abusive behavior to happen.

Edit: Thinking on it, I would have never purchased the game, or would have refunded it within the time frame, if I knew this was an extremely huge issue in the game. If you read the reviews before purchasing the game, I highly recommend you check out other games instead, similar ones such as the mentioned above Company of Heroes. You are better off using your money on a product that does not have such a flaw established within it. I know it is Early Access, but this is just blatantly unacceptable.

Seriously, read the negative reviews, I am not the only one who is victim to this, many others are too. The report system will genuinely hinder your experience. It has been going on for far too long & it just isn't worth your money."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Huge balance issues which are furthered each and every update and previous balance are barely touched. Dev streams reveal new things that are often so broken that it would make Riot Games blush. Huge potential but devs are hugely biased and only seemingly hear complaints from one side or the ones they want to hear.

EDIT:
As an example:
One faction, has a Tank called Mass Produced Tank (MPT). Given then name you'd think it would be possible to produce an enourmus amount of these tanks, and you would be right! This resulted in spamming Tanks on the battlefield which could only be met by spamming Tanks from the other which are generally slower. Now, who do you think the devs gave the solution to Tank spam to? The ones with a mass producable tank or the ones with slower Tanks? You guessed it! The ones with mass producable tanks! Now also include the fact that they also got the better Anti-Tank Infantry Weapon and you got yourself a whole lot of bias for one side, that the devs refuse to acknowledge. This is also fantastic for the players because the devs don't release hotfixes. The updates only come AFTER wars (time frame was generally 9-14 days per war but devs are trying to push for ~30) have been fought.

The MPT faction are also in constant disarray compared to the slow tank faction but somehow still able to push back and win. It will be difficult to really understand how important unification is in this not having played it yourself but if you trust my word, you can do almost nothing without it. Which only further proves the bias in stats and equipment one faction holds over the other.

EDIT 2:
After some time I realize that this not recommendation is just negative, but I wouldn't have spent so many hours inside this game if it was just bad.

The devs are absolutely and astonashingly amazing at designing and implementing *neutral* mechanics, things that affect both sides. They are great fun to play around with. The big issue is that they seem incapable of balancing and it keeps on getting worse (the balance)."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,Everybody has a microphone for some reason
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Some people say the community is toxic and because of that i was sceptic to buy, but eventually i did and i must say they are totally wrong. This game is amazing because of the players, people help each other, work together, roleplay a lot. Every time i play it's a new experience because of the new people i meet on the battlefield and beyond. Surely you can run into a negative person from time to time in a game as huge as this, but that's just a minority. This is truly a unique game, must try."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"game concept is great, but you will be killed by something off screen, camera position is jank af and the worst part of the game. Any other camera position would make this game rival AAA titles for popularity. the main failing of this game - visibility - its just silly and ruins the game"
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Imbalance! Wardens faction always has disadvantage in terms of technologies and resource placements. Newer updates always bring advantage to Colonials faction only. Many veteran players (from Wardens) have fed up playing because of this issues. If you still want to play this game, play as Colonials and enjoy an easy mode game."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Was fun, but faction balance getting worse and worse after each update. 
Also, horrible dev team.  Some of the worse devs I've ever encountered in terms of caring about their player base, how they respond to feed back, and responding to game issues and bugs.  Dev maturity level and professionalism is on the very low end. 
Only thing worse then server issues is dev intervention= prepare for a 90 second heads up for a server restart, and all your tanks get stolen."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Stay away from this game. 

The outcome of the wars you participate in are completely decided by people running a second account and draining important resources from places while they are being attacked, so you can't actually do anything to fight off an invasion.  It would be cool if strategy mattered in this strategic conquest game, but it simply does not.  At no point do you ever feel that your good idea made a difference in the long run.  It doesn't matter because in the end it's just endless spam of tanks and alts draining your defenses when no one is paying attention in the heat of battle.

The game is not balanced at all, even considering faction specific gear and vehicles.  The devs refuse to listen to the community, and as a result it will eventually be strangled to death by exploiters and alt account griefers.

The balance is absolutely terrible, the devs are arrogant, and the game is subpar."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Can't recommend it. It's a buggy, awful mess that's somehow only gotten worse with every single update these devs bother to push out.

Desyncing just seems to get worse and worse as you now have to start leading your hitscan weapons, bullets seem to vanish instead if hitting the enemy, bayoneting seems to get more unresponsive with each passing day as the game demands you to be within kissing distance of whoever you're trying to stab. Close quarters is a joke as your bullets simply go wherever they feel like, and usually it's away from the enemy. Shadow-dancing and run and gunning ruin whatever atmosphere and tone the game is trying to set, as there's nothing better than to get 360 quickscoped by a man running up a hill. Lag is frequent, high-ground is unbeatable, factions get access to different weapons and vehicles, meaning stealing, making alt accounts and sabotaging the enemy is needed to even the odds. 

I know I have 900+ hours on this game, but it's hard to justify buying this game when all you get is bad controls, bad camera, visual bugs, bad netcode, that have somehow never been addressed or fixed through the years as the devs are too focused on adding new content to keep player interest. With the numbers going down each day, and people leaving in rows as factions become more and more imbalanced the further into late-game we go. It's hard to recommend a game when the only times I had fun with it was when I was goofing off, going for bayonet charges and punching people in trenches. 

The main gameplay loop is so incredibly weak and unfun, you're better off grabbing whatever weapon interest you, and doing whatever you want, as a group of people will very easily fall into chaos by the sight of a single field-gun or mortar. Teamplay is recommended but not necessary, as people will often just ignore tactics and strategies. Mainly due to the awful way the game rewards such deeds, letting the players give out ranks and commends among themselves. And when buggy AI shooting and unforgiving lag is always in the way, there's little to do than to follow the highest rank in the fight and just hope he knows what he's doing.

The tutorial is a joke, unfun, and barely covers the basic aspects of the game. I've seen Sgt ranks running around with a wounded solider, frantically asking how they drop them for the medics to revive, along with dumb decisions like running in with a mounted cannon, with no knowledge of how it works or functions, only to get pounded by a firing squad. After 900 hours, I'm still even struggling to figure out the tank balance and how high-ground continues to make the game unplayable.

I can't with a full heart recommend this game on the grounds that it's quantity over quality. Instead of fixing the map, overpowered vaulting into high places or the buggy game mechanics, they continue to add boring, horrible guns that become so obsolete by late-game, there is simply no reason to produce or use them. Tanks and armor dominate the fields, making the job of infantry without anti-armor support a chore to do and have fun with. Bridges still haven't been fixed as bottlenecks are frequent, only being able to be broken by a strong tank push or artillery. I've now been playing for a better part of four years and I'm still struggling to see the fun aspect of this game. I've seen updates remove and add new things no one asked for and no one uses, yet they continue to add bad burst rifles which don't have a place in the battlefield, and with each faction getting a different roster of weapons, one will always come out on top in most situations. 

Do yourself a favor, and don't get into this game."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,dev bias is best bias. collies get all the tools meanwhile wardens get jack. Never seen a wargaming game so horrendously assassinated. This game is dead and the devs are happily pissing on the grave
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"This game is good by his concept, but the problem is that it's badly balanced.

-Positive side :

The community. Everyone is friendly towards each other, even with enemies sometimes (respect and stuff). Even if you're new you can ask anyone to teach you how the game works and they'll help you.

The game may seem hard to understand but there is basic tutorials on the camp's home region, you can also ask for guidance in game.

The game is fun, many gameplay styles such as building, logistics, frontline, artillery, partisan (going behind enemy lines to sabotage stuff), tanks, naval (naval update when ?).

Communication. There are many tools to communicate with the team with different purposes. Also a regiment system allowing you to play with a specific group for great operations.

The game is often updated.

-Negative side :
Even tho the devs knows the issues, they keep adding more content instead of fixing the existing ones, causing more imbalance.

Nothing is done against alt accounts that sabotages both teams. (using a 2nd account, log it in your enemy side and ruins everything unfairly)

When a team is winning too fast, the devs steps in and handicaps it for more longer than needed, causing the ""winners"" to lose.

Most asian playerbase is playing Colonials, causing the Wardens to get overwhelmed during night time EVERYDAY. Ruining a day of ""fair"" work.

If you can't accept defeat, don't buy this game.

I don't feel like the devs listen to the players's feedback and suggestions.


Conclusion : 

Foxhole is an unique game by it's genre and will give you many hours of fun with your team, only to be forgotten by the amount of problems there is. If you're a determined person, buy this game.
At the current state I don't recommend it for any other kind of player."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"so i put a dislike but dont get me wrong i love the concept of this game. i've had the game for a bit over 3 weeks now and i put alot of my time in it in the first week, oh how naive i was. this game is a 24/7 ongoing war between two (soon 3 according to the devs) factions. i chose the warden faction to start off and stuck with it all the way for now (you lear,n to despise the faction that is giving you trouble all the time). sadly it is quite blatant to note that the wardens have been nerfed into the ground. apart from the basic rifle, most equipement is blatantly superior on the other side, especially the most important ones : artillery and tanks. i'm at my 3rd war and after having lost 2 wars i can barely fathom ever winning a war by staying on this side. some say the devs have a bias for the colonial faction, which is pretty much ww2 allies , using alot of equipement that is not so much inspired by ww2 but in some cases blatantly copied. (while the colonials get a M6A1 hvy tank, the wardens get a hetzer(no turret)). also someone tell the devs that tanks without any mg is not a tank by defenition but a tank destroyer. there is nothing to balance the number of active players, and the wardens are bleedding players rn, because of several consecutive defeats , even if wardens claim to have won more wars since launch. i bet that will change very wuickly with the current meta. also the game is riddled with alts, players actively working against their own faction. i had the pleasure of seeing on e of them in action and we lost our position in the following hour. idk if the devs do anything about it. speaking of balance i dont think there is any. the devs seem to focus on balancing the victories and not the equipement. at some poit you spawn in 30secs, the next you spanw in 1m30 because reasons. this game needs some refinement from the devs. balance in players and equipment, but mostly players. i dont mind equipement inbalance that much unless it is clearly in favor of one faction and this is the case here. tip : you want to win? dont join the wardens they dont win in the current meta."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Game's tutorial is a mess, sprawled over an area with no real progression from one part of the tutorial to the next.  No real tutorial on certain mechanics.  The base gameplay is fine, but for a new player like me, no one wanted me to join them BECAUSE I am new, thus making the game basically unplayable as anything other than a bullet sponge due to lack of allies and being unable to actually do anything other than logistics.  And I refuse to be pigeon-holed into being just a ferryman for supplies all the time.  And before anyone asks, I did try to talk to people in the game and for every one nice player I had to deal with about eight or nine toxic players."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"I'm sincerely trying to find the good in this game, but so far it's unrewarding and nonsensical.

The aiming system makes NO sense (I know to wait, crouch, prone, etc--I still haven't HIT a single fucking person in 10 hours of playing), no one gives commendations to you unless you're in their clan, the clans are straight up bullies, and the griefing in the game by both sides is astounding (getting killed in my spawn by teammates, enemies parking barges under bridges to block them).

I see a potentially fun game in here, but it's hidden under a toxic community, some seriously deficient grinding mechanics, and a cumbersome and unintuitive combat system where aiming is whack-a-doodle and turning while prone is done in slow-motion."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Great concept but the vision and direction of the game is awful, clapfoot are idiots. They interfere with stupid changes midwar like increasing the spawn timer for warden to try to fuck with the odds and give the losing side an odds boost. In doing so they end up COMPLETELY flip flopping  Wardens have op tools early on and steamroll until collies get their op tech, at which point they steamroll. Not fun. Imagine being a new player with this shit. I lost my entire stash in less than 12 hours because the devs increased spawn timers for wardens, decreased for collies, and that allowed collies to take almost TWO entire provinces and take the town where my stash was. Absolute bullshit."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"If I could describe Foxhole's biggest flaws, it would be queue time and toxicity. Let's start with the queues.
Now queuing up to hop to a territory hex isn't all that bad, since you can still do stuff while you wait. The problem? You can only fast travel from the home island everyone is dropped into after getting past the main menu and travelling from one hex to another takes several seconds, AND you have to be at the border of the hex, meaning that you are stuck waiting to head to the hex you're needed at. This can take several minutes to several hours. All this because the territory hexes can't handle more than about 50 players at a time (I'm sure they can handle more, but the queue lines indicate otherwise). All of this waiting and restrictions mean much needed reinforcements won't arrive in time.
And now, let's talk about the toxicity:
If you play logistics, then you'll encounter dumbasses who think blocking the road that allied trucks need to go through with a flatbed is the funniest shit in the world. You'll encounter asshats who keep stealing your truck and running off with the supplies you took over an hour to craft because of the queue times in the factories. You'll encounter assholes who keep shoving you off the road and throwing your truck filled with supplies that took you a long time to cobble together into the icy water. Why? Because the asshole has a higher rank than you and their God Complex is showing so visibly they should be charged with indecent exposure.
If you play on the frontline, then you'll encounter rampant morons on your team who think using you as a shield is a good idea, who believe that teamwork actually means ""using the corpse of your ally as a sandbag"" or ""stealing your teammate's equipment"". You'll encounter bastards who will teamkill you relentlessly because you aren't doing banzai charges against machine gun nests in fortified trenches. You'll encounter retards who think they guy armed with only a pistol and has a paper cut is more in need of medical treatment than you, someone with a light machine gun, several grenades, and bleeding enough to fill a punch bowl in about a minute.
If you are a builder, God have mercy on your wretched soul if you aren't in a dominant clan, because you will be hazed, bullied, and false reported for not building to the local Klan's EXACT specifications. And don't you DARE believe you have good ideas, because only the Klan leader is allowed to have ideas, no matter how STUPID they might be.
If I was told to say good things about the game at gunpoint, I'd say the gameplay is good and the concepts in the game are very promising, but a LOT more work needs to be done with it. Namely collisions, road width, and view distance. Other than that, the game by itself is serviceable.
Overall, Foxhole is the game with the most problematic community that I've ever seen in my ten years on Steam, and I highly recommend staying away from this game unless you are rampantly self-hating like I am. Until the devs decide to stomp out the toxicity in this damn game, I cannot recommend this game even if you paid me to do it. It is $20 that I will never get back, but, as the old saying goes, ""you must live with your mistakes."""
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"I tried, I really did, and all I can say is don't buy. You'll waste a lot of time for frustration with a broken game and dealing with a toxic community.

I would not recommend this game as it currently exists. 

In terms of the game itself, it's explained poorly. Important mechanics aren't known unless another player teaches you. Usually they'll just call you a fucking idiot instead. The chat log is a constant stream of griefing and whining about one thing or another, usually that X faction has Y weapon that is much better. Both factions seem to think the developers have an unfair bias for the other.

Things that seem like a good idea will be rudely shut down as actually not being so purely because of game mechanics. You should be linking trenches that have no exits to bunkers with no entrances - if you don't, you'll be insulted and someone will destroy it. Trenches are apparently frowned upon, which is a problem as the game is heavily marketed on their use.

Snowstorms grind everything to a very boring, unfun halt. Some might say that's the point. I just don't see the fun in basically not being able to do anything in the area until the snow goes away, because you die in 2 mins without a fire. Does the game have a meter for how long you have left? No. You have to see how ""frozen"" your character is, with the last thirty seconds basically looking the same throughout, making it total guesswork.

You will often get stuck or not be able to vault over things that you should be able to vault over, which you will usually find out in the middle of a situation where being able to get over that low wall is what stops you being killed. There are also weird glitches to do with water being in trenches and areas of low ground, where you'll just go under the map and drown to death, losing all of your gear. This is a common thing.

Most of all though it's the playerbase. I found a few good eggs, but unfortunately what seems to happen is that the higher rank someone is, the more they feel they can treat everyone around them like garbage. 

I think the final straw for me was that me and another player built up a trench network that helped us push up to an enemy base. We spent a lot of time and effort doing it and had effectively defended the position and killed a lot of enemy soldiers from it as others joined us. We were in grenade range of their fortifications when two armoured cars and a couple of our guys on foot purposefully destroyed them, called us fucking dumbasses for building them, and made a point of killing us for bothering by destroying the trench we were in as we were arguing the progress we'd made before they decided to show up.

Add to this the constant alting as people on both teams constantly make an alt account to sabotage and spy on the enemy before refunding the game and doing it again; the constant bickering between clans that will fuck each other over and put the war effort at risk just so they can get what THEY want, and you end up with a toxic, unfun community to play in.

EDIT: Totally forgot, but if you're expecting any kind of progression or reward, you're in for a bad time. The only thing that progresses is your rank, which does very minor things like let you put a map marker on the map. You don't get better with any weapons. You don't get any special skills. Your character just does not progress in any meaningful way for all of the hours you put into the game. Even when you win the war, there's no recognition, no stats to look back on or anything - it's just straight on to the next one."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,I really spammed this game in excessive amounts and I must say after these short 2 and a half months I can confidently say I have never seen a game were devs are more delusional about balancing requests from community get ignored more useless junk gets added and it is purely not fun
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"The amount of man children in this game that have massive power trips is a big thumbs down.
"
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"poor community, team griefers and team agros. lots of server drops."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"I would recommend this game to a friend, if I wanna give them trust issues"
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,pretty fun game especially if you bomb rush enemy positions and get mowed down by machine gun fire lol
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"First off, Foxhole is a fun, great top down shooter that gets you involved in many aspects of war such as combat, logistics, intelligence, armoured units, naval units etc etc. 

Lets start by naming all of the positives about Foxhole
1.) Unique top down perspective
2.) Large community (Regiments/clans) 
3.) There's always something to be done (keeps you busy for hours, even for days!)
4.) Different roles within the war zone such as Naval and land combat, different soldier roles such as machine gunner, medic, Anti-tank, Anti-infantry. etc. 
5.) Massive map 
6.) Logistical deliveries/runs make good use of kicking back and relaxing as you drive to different delivery drop off zones (Helps if you aren't feeling like combating). 

Now for the BUT........

A bit of history first

I used to run a regiment in Foxhole, and i was planning on dedicating a small settlement on the map with a town hall to my regiment and to those who visit it, the initial plan of our very first regiment settlement was to make Diesel, easy to produce with not much hassle, we put up signs stating what vehicles can be used, parking areas and the like and we also put signs which showed the way to our settlement as well as a wholeheartedly placed regimental welcome at the town hall, after almost a few days into our very first regimental settlements/operation we came back to a horrible greifing of our settlement, players had vandalised, mocked, and even destroyed some of the settlement, i was hurt beyond belief that a soldier who was fighting for us was also against us, after this i didn't play the game for over a year, i didn't know and/or had the power to report these greifers. 

I was a strong, confident leader, hoping to add some valuable resources and man power to the war effort, but it seems like that some Warden soldiers just blatantly disrespect and mock those who want to be willing, strong leaders....... 

And in all sincerity to i have forgotten who they were (those who greifed my regimental fortification/settlement), but i will never forget the actions that those arseholes took to not just damage my regiment and the reputation of my regiment but also to sabotage the war efforts of the Wardens. 

And message from me to those saboteurs.....Go fuck yourselves and never EVER return back to the game....PERIOD."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Devs do not listen to player feedback, ruin the balance with every updates.
Combat is 99% firing at things outside of your screen
Driving is 99% driving into friendly vehicles coming the other way because the view is too zoomed in by design.
ALT and locust clans are ruining the game, yet the devs refuses to acknowledge said problem!"
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"An incredibly fun war-game with a (often) approachable and helpful community. My first few minutes in the game were spent cluelessly wandering around the tutorial, and the next few hours were spent cluelessly firing into the fog of war on the front line. 

The more I played, the more I learned. I began to understand the importance of logistics - supplies are needed to keep the frontline up and running. Tanks and vehicles are a rare and precious luxury. The decision between a semi-automatic rifle and a fully-automatic SMG is not just a preference decision, but a circumstantial one as well. 

This game incorporates the widescale player-based warfare of games like Planetside 2 and (albeit on a much larger scale than) Battlefield. It utilizes a top-down point of view which is often disorienting, but adds a level of suspense - you never know what's lurking just outside of your view. 

There are no NPCs - just players. Some players choose to spend their time driving trucks from the well-guarded factories far from the battlefield all the way to the war-torn front lines. Other players prefer to man turrets, cannons, tanks and other destructive vehicles that they may go where they're needed and help clear the way. Other players choose the life of a soldier on the front, constantly engaging in a violent give-and-take with the enemy, whose trenches are less than a hundred meters across the no man's land. There are so many options for how to play this game that I can't limit them all to a short review. You could dedicate your time to saving lives with a first aid kit, or grab a small group of guys and slip behind the enemy's lines and decimate their supply depots. This game is truly about living out your WW2 fantasies on a grand-scale.

I recommend this game at any price. For an early-access game it feels cohesive, fleshed out and (dare I say it) finished. I haven't been this happy with a purchase in a long time."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"A very relaxing game

Tip: Let enemy soldiers bleed out so u can lure and snipe the medics"
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Best Game if you want a real teamplay based game. There is no alternative.
For nearly everything you need other people. You cant even heal yourself as a medic (sounds stupid but good for balance). All Ammu, Vehicles, Weapons, Materials are crafted and shipped to the front by Players. For big things you need cranes and big trucks/ships to transport/place them. It feels like playing a single soldier in Companies of Heroes with hundreds of other player on a huge persistent map. The logistic systems feels like a own little eco system.

You don't need a group of friends. There are enough veterans on the front you can fellow or simple use the open voice chat to talk...

The Devs always try to improve the game and engine. They even work on a new server engine.

PS: If you need a short guide in german I can help you :)"
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Great community, fun times, PTSD. Solid 8/10."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,Not one step back!
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Let me first say: It is a good game. The concept of an MMO war with full fledged wartime logistics is impressive, and generally enjoyable.

With that stated, it has one blaring issue: Server Queues...

They are dodgy at best, and can frequently cause a failure for entire operations that you and your regiment(s) have been preparing for days. In today's day and age, with auto-scaling cloud compute systems, the fact this game maintains such a strict, and frankly, buggy queue system kills so much of it. Being unable to provide logistics and manpower to a region because it's queued for 2 hours is... just, unacceptable."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"A gaming experience unlike any other. If there ever was a game that gave a taste of what the planning and execution of a real war is, it's this one."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"I would recommend this game to everyone who like teamplay. Probably the one among rarest games that will make u feel like discord is obsolite, various channels for coms that are playing crutial role in getting unforgetable moments in the game. Game gives u pretty unique possibilities to shift between PVE and PVP in matter of minutes while at the same time feels rewarding whatever u do; if u decide to play as crafter, delivery (logistics) or claping enemies, their machines and structures on frontlines that are persistant 24/7, u can do that whenever ur soul desires. Community is very helpful, if u are new just ask someone in chat or in frontlines and there will be someone who would explain basics. So far in my 700hrs i never went mad or rage and even if i left the game for some time i left it cuz i had my fun and some new interests poped. 
Dev team is pretty creative and listens players"
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,Great game.  It feels like EVE online and Planetside 2 had a baby.
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"bias and balancing issues, ridiculous queue times and half baked, buggy, non-tested features being introduced, very nearly a good game"
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"This is the first ever game that I bought and I'm so sad that it wasn't what I expected it to be. 

My plan was to do logi for about 30 min, build a small tankette with the extra materials and choo choo to the battlefield. Instead, I spent 2 hours doing other things to wait for components. It ended up not being enough and I later discovered that people were camping the mines anyway. 

So I decided to deliver weapons to the frontlines and it took me 20 minutes to get there. People complain about 5 second ads and long waiting times in other games. Why are there no trains or airplanes? Sigh.

After arriving, the fighting that I saw was nothing but people basically staring at each other unable to push at all. There was a lack of everything and including any fun. 

I forced myself to think positively for another 6 hours but I finally have to admit. This game plays like water tastes like."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"This game is insane. I've wanted something like this for a very long time. Even after playing just a couple days I've got some crazy war stories to tell, like The Lamb Sauce Massacre in the Deadlands at the Bloody Bridge. Spent a morning trying to hold the defensive line, a few big pushes with about 100 people on either side. Nothing quite like a coordinated charge into machine gun fire while someone is DJ'ing with a soundboard. We charged to the sound of the screaming cowboy meme lmao. Eventually they brought their tanks in and we had to hold the line long enough for the logistics guys to bring us some satchel charges to blow the bridge. Took a break around mid-day, came back in the evening, guys were still fighting over that bridge. I went scouting through the wards to the west, ended up hooking up with a tank company behind enemy lines. They found a captured jeep and told me to go source some BMats for them to repair. After spending like 15 minutes sourcing materials and finding a refinery, I managed to make it back and somehow found them at the same camp. I then helped repair the same bridge I helped blow up that morning, allowing that same tank group to push forward followed by the infantry. We managed to destroy the enemy base on the other side and set up a defensive position to hold it. That was just ONE day. Every time I've hopped on has been different. Absurd memes, new challenges and things to learn, everyone trying to contribute to the war effort. Wouldn't have expected a top-down shooter to be one of the most immersive war games I've ever played"
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,Sorry .. I tried it and then returned it.  WAY too hard to get in to it.  The tutorial was not helpful .. I just followed some people around and I had no idea what I was doing ..
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"This game can be great, and can be awful.
It depends entirely on two things.
1. The community and people around you in your own team.
2. Your own commitment.

If you just want to jump in and randomly rush towards the frontline and die 50 times over, you'll get bored after an hour. This is not Running With Rifles.
If you want to cooperate with people and feel part of a larger weeks-long war, you're gonna absolutely love this.

The first time i gave this game a go, i was not in the right state of mind, and asked for a refund.
Two years later, now i gave it another go, but with a different mindeset.
Instead of treating the game like an arcade run and gun shooter, i treated it like an Arma 3 campaign, or Squad. And boy its a totally different experience.

So what's it like with ""pubbies"" in open voice comms multiplayer?
It varies. There are jerks out there, but literally it doesnt matter, because they will die and you wont hear them again. Hopefully before you die.
But even so, in general the community kind of has a self-regulating thing going. If someone just goes postal and teamkills and steals resources like crazy, odds are the other 90 players around are gonna turn on him, and put him out of his misery.

But can you play it solo? Absolutely.
You can focus on building defences like an engineer, or delivering building supplies (or ammunition you produced in the factory production chains), to the frontline. And people will legitimately cheer for your aid.
Seeing a load of 100 anti-tank grenades and 50 rpg launchers (and medkits) get delivered to your base about to run out of supplies, is a huge deal.

Or if you want to play it solo but in combat, absolutely.
You can become a partisan, yourself or a small team of 2-3 can go deep, and i mean deep, into enemy territory, stay hidden, and lay ambushes near the roads to take out their supply trucks (which i just explained are extremely important).
If you singlehandedly take out 1 truck that was carrying hundreds of ""shirts"" (soldier supplies, meaning actual respawn points for that forward base), you could literally be affecting the outcome of that frontline since the enemy now cant respawn if they run out.

The real meat of the game is, the moment you ""get it"", is when you choose one location on the battlefield and stick with it for a few days. Log back in the next day and go to the same place, see what changed, how things progressed (or was pushed back).
This is how you really see how your own individual actions can have impacts on the grander war.

That 68mm anti-tank gun you painstakingly craned onto a boat, shipped down a river, craned onto a flatbed, and delivered and assembled on the frontline, could have been a deciding force in stopping that 1-2 extra enemy tanks from pushing through, which could have prevented your town from being overrun last night.
Likewise, when you do attack and destroy these defences yourself, you have the satisfaction of knowing it took real people real effort to move that stuff to the frontline, and you just ruined hours worth of work for them.
(Stealing fun from others)

So when you log on the next day, and see your turret still standing there at 20% health, with enemy tank wrecks up ahead, and a local twilight-hours regiment of infantry holding the fort down and re-building bunkers, that feeling is totally different from any other game.
Because in other games you dont have the long term aspects to consider."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,Do you like the sound of war?
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Meh game personally. Fun if you learn how to play it.
But I just happened to join at the end of a war and there isn't really anything to do except piss around and wait. 
I wasn't going to do either.

Good game if you like this sort of thing."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Despite its flaws, which are to be expected of an early access game, Foxhole is quickly becoming a new favorite of mine. Joining a regiment has only enhanced the experience for me!"
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"It has the perks to be a perfect mil-sim game. Played for good amount of time, not much. But , enough to know the function for each role the player plays.Should you get this game...?
It depends if you love to play full in depth hardcore military sandbox game. Where each moment counts and requires all hands on deck. It fully immerses you into the game and at times  I literally check  for current situations  on my phone when I'm not playing. Good people, you need to communicate and this game has a good player base community(As far as I've come across) so you're gonna have to communicate to strategise your game-play and work as a team.
Few downsides to this is that, movement kinda gets clunky...especially when trying to vault over obstacles, getting through the window/ fences..etc.. It sometimes doesn't trigger the animation and you're constantly trying  by spamming the spacebar. 
Equipping item takes long...not forever... but it takes time to load-up. 
It could've been better if they added a feature to allow you to choose how much ammo you want to carry and give you all of it at once and not 1 by 1, making,you wait in between for each item to collect. Still room for improvement.
Again, If you think of getting this game, check youtube ...some people have made a huge content explaining the game in detail. Its pros and cons and if its really worth it. To me... its worth it... I'm not disappointed. Its still in early access...they can improve it."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,devs are completely delusional and fuck the balance of the game. dont waste your time
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Another Discord-centric Game that requires you to register a phone number with discord in order to post...no thanks devs. I will be willing to reverse this review on the condition that the discord is made public without usage of a phone number. TBPF - they shouldn't even be allowed to use discord for steam-based games, but I'm willing to overlook that as long as I don't have to fork over my phone # irl to Discord."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,Devs dont play their own game and they dont listen to their player base verywell. The devs of this game is a fuckin joke.
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,Awesome game. If you played Infantry Online or Planetside you will love this.
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,I bought it and literally haven't stopped playing it... this is the best game ever...
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,very fun only down side is the stalemates
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Conceptually, this game is brilliant. It's sprawling player-driven online war with a huge number of different roles and a super passionate and involved community. The regions, weapons, vehicles, and tools at your disposal are all incredibly varied and let you play at your own pace, and all the roles (frontline, logistics, artillery, tanks, etc) all work together to drive each team's war effort.

Unfortunately, in execution the game starts to fall apart a bit for me. I feel the devs are too set on making the game as ""realistic"" as possible that they forget that games should be fun too. Don't get me wrong - Foxhole is unlike any other multiplayer game I've played, and some of the battles I've taken part in have been incredible - but there are too many inconveniences and annoying mechanics that make this game feel like a chore to play a lot of the time. These include:

[list]
[*]The gun bloom system makes firefights slow to a crawl and adds too much RNG to the gunplay.
[*]Production rates for some essential materials are agonizingly slow and make logistics extremely tedious.
[*]This also extends to vehicles, which makes fielding them a pain in the arse and turns tank battles into an annoying cat and mouse game since neither side wants to lose the tank they likely spent hours gathering supplies for. 
[*]Infantry battles can turn into grinding stalemates around bridges and chokepoints and aren't very fun to play unless a major push happens, which can take quite a long time depending on the front.
[*]There's no meaningful progression. Tech trees are reset after each 'war' and the end result ultimately feels kind of pointless since the map gets reset and both sides go back to square one soon after anyway. Personal progression is also nonexistent aside from a rank next to your name that you get through player commends - which are usually granted to logistics players. I feel like this could be offset a bit with different uniforms for each rank, war medals/badges, or something else to make playing worthwhile, especially for veteran players.
[/list]

According to my friends a lot of these mechanics weren't present at launch, and were introduced by the devs to fit their ""vision"" of a realistic war game. Unfortunately, I think they made it a bit *too* realistic, and the game's suffered for it. 

All that said... would I recommend this game? It depends. If you can find a clan or group of people to show you the ropes and run operations with, the game can be pretty fun and you can bypass a lot of the tedium. The flaws are still there though, and they're too big for me to fully enjoy the game. I seriously hope the game improves since the concept is amazing, but I'm not gonna hold my breath."

Pretty much the minimum expected of a game lol."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Started playing after the Winter Army update. Game has a unique persistent war concept where two sides battle it out, and everything is player built; the grind in the game is farming/crafting/transporting war supplies and materials to support the front lines. Overall I did enjoy my time playing, but there are major issues plaguing the game. Players get very ‘tribal’ for their team, and the experienced players have 1000s of hours vs the average player with approx 30ish hours. Newer players can accidentally grief somewhat easily, this leads to  a lot of bad blood and toxicity. I’m probably done playing this game, and had a lot of fun. A few of the major gameplay loops are rough around the edges, and I am not satisfied with the attention the devs give to those areas vs adding new stuff.

Pro:
* Unique and fun game concept
* Thrives with organized groups
* The look, sound, and gameplay is mostly tight and feels good.
* Immersive

Con:
* Small dev team
* Devs focus on adding new guns/vehicles, leads to power creep, feels like devs do not play their own game enough with decisions they make.
* Balancing is BAD. Each team has different gear, but generally one side has a few superior tools that make the game unfun. Balance in Foxhole is switching which side has better tools.
* Game was not designed with the increased player count, queues are always high in the most important/active/fun areas.
* Voice chat within the game is awful. Finding clans within the game/official discord channel is awful.
* Learning curve is not suited to the average player
Players use alternative accounts to grief, devs have failed in creating anti griefing mesures.
"
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,Does not run on linux with proton after the last update.
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"If you are interested in buying this game, beware what you are getting into.

Pro:
Sandbox
You can do everything, buidling, logistics, fighting, everything is run by player
Graphic is good
Variety of vehicle and weapons at your disposal

Con:
Developer, will explain below
Not good for solo player, except for infantry sort of, you need 2 or more people to use any combat vehicle, is not call of duty or counter strike where you can carry a team by yourself alone

The game itself is run by player, is both a positive and a negative as you rely on other player to build defenses and bring you weapon and other to fight alone side but if one of this brake down then everything brake down. So, as soon as you start the game, you want to find a clan/regiment to join so someone can help you as well as teach you some of the mechanics and finding teammates.
The problem lies with devs and attitude of devs, they are the people that really don't care about player bases. They focus on pushing new content without balancing them, and doesn't balance them until much much later, constant server problem, ignorance of the actual imbalance they causes, these are people that would tell you play the game 8 hrs a week when in fact the game itself can't operate on that hour if everyone were to do that. The game operates on a asymetrical tech tree, is a good idea but poor implementation as none of it are balanced or balanced based on target practice instead of considering this is a multiplayer war game with much much more element to consider and is not a 5 vs 5 moba. They place a system that doesn't reward contribution but punish it such as technology, the side with slower technology would get boost, the side with lower population in certain hour would get a boost which eventually leads to abuses from both side because why would you lead when you know you would loses the buff. They do not understand their system is bad and being abused and living in a perfect delusion. If you plan to buy the game, is not a bad game, but they developer themselves is trying to make it one, if you do end up buying the game, find a clan/regiment that can play with you, it will be much better than playing alone."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"I would not recommend this game in its current form. The developers care very little for balance, providing each faction with overpowered weapons and vehicles with few counters by the other side. In addition, although this game is marketed as a persistent MMO with players deciding the outcome of the game, the developers are actually the ones who decide who wins. From controlling the weather, to the tech tree, to the tech spawn rates, everything in this game is controlled by the developers to such an extent that you can be sure that the only way you win is if they want you to win. This game was fun, once, before asymmetric vehicles and weapons were introduced. In its current form, this game is a shell of what it could be."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"10/10 would Logi again.

Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,great game
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Fun game, many of the hacker, abuser things you might see in other reviews are mostly gone. Sure there are still a lot of abusers and ""spies"" but the game is bloody fun, espicially with a friend. My favorite part about the game is that unlike trailers of other games, which dramatically exagerate the gameplay or are staged. I've been in battles crazier than the trailer ones. Game is fun for everyone. PTSD will be aquired, and please, for us medics. Stop running away from us."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"So after some consideration, I would not recommend this game to others, as you might enjoy the first few hours for discovering how the game works, but one you understand the game you will find it boring.

Let me clarify that the game that people played in 2018 and even 2019 is very different than the game today, thus is would invalid any recommendation from that time, as the game had changed from its roots.

The game has two main aspects: combat and logistics.

Logistics used to be about gather resources, make needed supplies; deliver that supplies to a place that desperately needs it, repeat. In half a hour, or an hour, you could have done the entire loop. It gave meaning to each part of the loop. Over gathering was wasting time you could make or deliver. Making the wrong supplies could have ended up in losing ground. Delivering to the wrong place would leave the place that does need the supplies to die. All of that in a decent amount of time invested.

Things are not that way anymore. You can gather for your entire gameplay and almost never be punished for it directly. You can overproduce supplied for hours without it ever been deliver and it will be celebrated and supported by the developers. you can deliver what you want to where you want and someone might complain but that's about it.

Logistics became disconnected completely. Doing the entire process can take you from 1 to two hours for low amount of supplies, that in that time frame might be irrelevant. Focusing on only one has its own problems.

Combat used to be however aim most accurate and fast, using the trains and his weapon to his advantage to gain the appear hand wins. it could be fast or grinding depending on how many defaces the enemy and your faction has, the train, and the players overall skill.

Not anymore. Now it is waiting 2 to 3 seconds for your ""stability"" and only than you can guaranty a hit. They slowed it to the point of assaulting is either been lucky or overwhelming in such a sense that the enemy can't do anything. This is steamrolling. The main skill is to know how to place yourself in a place that allows you to have enough time to aim before your enemy dose, or place cat and mouse with him. The pace itself had slowed down unless we are talking tanks which just kill everything if the crew is skilled. Tank with good infantry support just kills anything.

putting it all together, taking into fact that you are designed to die a lot, but between death and getting back to the front you spend between 1 to 3 min, and you depended on teamwork that if you do not have friends/in a clan you can only depend on so much, than combat is beastly die until something happens. It isn't my kind of fun.

The developers did everything to kick off their old competitive combat players that cherished their skill based combat and compete in FCL in favor of, well, slugging it up the front. The game was meant to be a slow war. They decided to sacrifice the fun to achieve it.

I aren't spending 5h in a night for meters only to lose entire map cus during my sleep time no one in the faction was in the front so enemy just PVE and took it. That's not fun to find out. Player activity imbalance was always an issue the devs addressed in bad ways as they seem to not understand why the old core players enjoyed the game.  There might be a few old players here and there, but most don't player even once a week anymore. I wonder why.

If you want an mmo i would suggest to you avilon online, it is also harsh but at least fer and enjoyable. If you want a third person shooter with defaces building, out of luck buddy, this game will only waste your time.

By the way the pay to play never solved greethers and devs don't really deal with known greethers at all that bad mouth new players and making them leave the game. 

I will give credit to the devs for delivering on most of their promises. However been good people and been good game  developers are two different things, and I don't want to play a game anymore just cus the devs ussely do what they say they do.

The clans are fuild of politics, and as a player that likes to play both factions it is horrible experience, but I can't blame them. Those same people use alts to spy on one another, in a game.... just so you will understand the state of mind of the ""hardcore"" players. Most of them can't fight properly or do logistics effiently. They don't play for that nor do they want to try to achieve mastery of the game. most of those players had left. There are some here and there, like duri. Those are the exception, not the rule.

To sum it up, the game mechanic (loops) are agents you're playing in a relative amount of time, hard to do anything if you only have 2h a day. The community is paranoid because it wants to metagame, and developers endorse the current state instead of not liking it. In other words, there are hundreds of game that you can play and do more with your time. You might be what it takes to change the community in foxhole, but ask yourself, should you invest your time in a game that does not like you having time?

I had personally was in a clan that had another clan that wanted to ""merge"" only to steal the good players and leave the rest in the clan they wanted to merge with. What kind of sick person comes with such ideas in a non-competitive game!? Let alone any game!? That is just one of the hora stories I can tell you of what happens in clan ""politics"".

Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"I have a love hate relationship with this game, I love the artwork and content (even though some say it needs more and it does, it is slowly dying) I can 100% say there is no other game like this game and that is what makes it so special. 

Pros: 
Missions give you access to gear and items needed to play the game, they start from the beginning armor to end game gear (nothing thats 100% wanted but it gives you access to play end game content).

There is an arcade side of the game, which was the original concept. 4 gates consisting of 29 floors, but only 24 floors that have monsters. The arcade gates change every 7 days and its random, so every arcade run you do will be different from the last. 

If you wanna merchant, there is plenty of promos you can sink your money into. 

Cons: 
There is a ton of promos, one every 2 weeks. They throw promos out like they are candy and are not working toward new content and game updates. 

If you have to submitted a support ticket then you should expect 2-48 hours of waiting for a reply. This is how they get money out of you, they force you into paying for in-game items with real money cause you cant contact support when you have issues of not getting back into a party. 

The Develops and Gm's are not dedicated to running this game, and their minds are only after $$$$, but you are thinking what gaming company is not only after $$$$? All of them are, for the most part, but this one is one of the worst ones because as I stated they refuse to help you if you need help. I've heard ""sorry we couldnt help you out in time, maybe next time"" after they expected the rest of my party to wait 2-3 hours for me to get back into the party. 

You need to see this game as it truely is, It is only about pretty costumes and accessories and thats it. This game is mainly used to see who looks the best and as a chat room. Just think of this game as a chat room version of Tinder with mini games to play like PvP and missions etc. 


So end point is no i wouldn't recommend this game."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"This is a neat little game which isn't for everybody, But i personally enjoy it.
Pros (Hopefully with meaning)
+Easy and quick-to-learn controls make the players able to quickly adapt to the game.
+Fun and challenging level design keeping you on your toes with enemies and puzzles.
+Fun and challenging bossfights with great different mechanics to defeat each one.
+Easy to see everything on screen due to it being mostly top-down display.
Cons (With yet again, Hope of meaning)
-Can get repetetive with the grinding.
-Hard to beat the lowest-down (aka hardest) levels without friends on board.
-Playing with random people can be frustrating without proper communications.
-The crafting system requires lots of grinding to be done to gain the resources for each item.
In short its a well-balanced game and fun for people who enjoy quick bursts of action, time-taking puzzles and lots of multiplayer fun!

Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"I started playing this game to get the free tf2 items. However, while playing I got fond of it. Its really fun so I recommend this to not just TF2 players but everyone."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"This is one of the games I played with a great community. Its unique concept is like none others. I'd definitely recommend this game. It has its ""dying phase"" but I'm really hoping that the Game Devs are still planning to update and put more content to the game. I'd purchase things that this game offer if it gets updated. ( SHOUT OUT: Paging Grey Havens, Please proceed to the Game Dev room now... )

I know. It's boring if you're playing it alone. Make some friends, talk to strangers, don't be aloof. It's very addictive when you have people to share your moments with.

Here's what I thought: 

> Artstyle - Its cute and very unique
> Gameplay - Challenging. Well, not if you have good gears. Bottom line, its all about teamwork. Unless you like to play solo.
> Music - Lovely music you got there bud. Its engaging.
> Community - Its Great! That's why I love this game.
> Players - I'd say 50 - 50. Some players are nice and friendly, some are not.
> Concept - Can you name any game with the same concept? I can't. 
> Auction House - Oh my fudgy bars! Those are very expensive!
> Supply Depot - Nooo! The trade market keeps on raising! Make it stahp! 
> Grinding - Aw man, this is a bad RNG. Need 'em orbs please!
> Guilds - I don't know about you, but I love my guild. First and Last. 
> Wiki - Eh? Is the sidebar really down there? Hmm, care for a fix?
> Steam Login - Why can't I login my Steam to Wiki page? That's crazy, man! 
> Servers - Oh my, why do I have a red dot? Mind if you guys put up some Asian servers? Please?
> Patch Note - Oh come on!, Where the dang are the Patch Notes? I mean sure, you guys post updates on twitter... but....
> DLC - I'd be fine if you make more of 'em DLC's too. Like maybe, a side story like OCH?
> Price Boxes - Will you guys re-release Rageous Stuffs? I've been craving for them since I started playing...
> Coliseum - Ah, no ones playing there anymore. Make some more PVP. Maybe like Capture the Ball? or Chess? or Maze?
> Rank - Man, being a Vanguard ain't that good... What am I supposed to do now? Hoard stuffs? Collect gears?
> Story - The stoy is incomplete. We all got stranded in Cradle. So, there's more content you can actually make here... Like maybe go to the moon? Well, why not?, Cradle has a moon right there in the Main Screen. And what about our homeplanet? our homeworld? What? they're just... gone? Still so many plot holes. And maybe you can have a story on why the Snabolax, Jelly King, Roarmulus twins, and Vanaduke keep on respawning each time we delve deep into the unknow parts of Cradle. Maybe because TIME is reseting? Cause why not, it is the Clockworks... get it? 

Here's hoping, like most of the Knights out there who still enjoys playing this game, that it'll live on for another 5 or more years. Because I know it's not abandoned yet. https://twitter.com/Cronus_GH/status/829819314475765760

Good luck to the Devs - Grey Havens.
Kudos for keeping this game alive at the moment!"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"So here is the thing I am going to say my OPINION on this game. (I hope you read what is on caps :P)

Q:Is the game fun?
A:Yes, if you like to grind it is pretty fun and if you have friends to play it with you it will make the grind easier since your loot is ""shared"".

Q:How is the community?
A:I am not someone that can answer correctly that because I prefer to play solo instead with friends xD But from what I saw and interacted with I must say that the community is pretty good.

Q:I played a bit and saw almost no one, is it always like this?
A:Now, unfortunally, yes. When I played for the first time (2010 maybe) it had a lot of people.

Q:Is it pay to win?
A:No, not even close. You can convert 10k crowns(the game's currency) into energy(the paid currency).

Q:Why would I want the energy?
A:To not grind xD

TL;DR: Game is very grindy if you don't want to pay. Community pretty good but small. If you don't like to grind stay away. :)
"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,This is a fun arcade-style game that you can sink your teeth into and not get bored for a while. Something casual for me.
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,This is a fun game to play if your into mission type games. In this game you play as a knight taking on missions trying to recover lost valuables that have been lost when your ship had crashed. This game is an online game. Interact with others and make friends. Team up with people around the world or with your friends to take on missions. Level up your gear to take on harder levels. This game does not demand high system requirements to run. Overall a fun and interesting game to play.
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"except the starlight cradle update, it's dead





doesn't stop me from loving this game though"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"I use to play this game quite alot back in the old days, when in order to change the world you had to sink your gems into the elevator machine and hope it changed to something you liked. I check back in this game last year or so, and it's just gone down the crapper. Try doing a mission to progress your story: no one's on to join, and if they do, one death and they quit. Most of the people i've run into are just standing in front of the auction house, hoping some hard to get item appears, and the most popular guild i know hasn't been active in years. Add onto the fact that almost 99% of the stuff you want can only be bought with/accessed with real money, (and don't say that they don't. try getting a key for the endgame dungeon crafting station from the auction house. never gonna happen) and this is just another game that had 'pure' beginings and is now 'corrupted' into a pay2win model. -1/10
Also, LAG! LAG EVERYWHERE!!!
LAG!"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"it's ok


pros:
-> if you're a fan of top down fighting and dungeon crawling, this game can suck up your free time like a sponge
-> it's also a lot of fun to play with friends, up to a party of 4 players, from real life or haven
-> art style isn't shabby and pretty easy on the eyes, fun for any age range in the whole family
-> this game is already pretty old, but there's still a lot to do for newcomers and old pros alike
---> combat is very flush, with tons of flashy weapons and even more bad guys to use them on
---> there's plenty of background lore and tidbits like that hidden in this game if you're into that
---> feeling fabulous? theres lots of armor and accessories to help you look fly, and thats pretty fun
---> join or create a guild to form a small community with more than just 3 other players

cons:
-> there's a lot of incredibly useful hidden mechanics that the game really should teach you, like using your shield to cancel attack animations and increasing reaction time
-> a lot of the better weapons and armor can only be achieved through unconventional ways or buying it at an inflamed price, which can throw a wrench in your plans for your perfect arsenal
-> the game makes you grind a lot for ingame currency to be able to pass through a lot of the game
---> a remedy to this is if you do your homework and plan out what arsenal you want by the end of the game so that you dont make stupid descisions too early on in the game
---> the main issue with the grind wall is because of the ""alchemy orb"" crafting system and the ""hall of heroes"" quests that make sure you have the resources and equipment to go into higher difficulty floors

-> there's not really any recent updates at all anymore, and the community is slowly shrinking...

conclusion:
i think this game won't last that much longer anymore,
but you should still get it and play if you like top down shooters and dungeon crawlers;
i'm pretty sure this game is worth the free time it swallows despite being a free game"

Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"The game is fun, but the ""stamina"" system does not belong in a PC game/"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"Not gonna lie i think i lost the counter of how much i edited this review.

This game sadly is in a bad state currently in terms of content
Tough the few players who still play are nice 

I personally loved this game alot, and i still do, well not the game itself, rather the community and its idea, its sorta complicated.

the gameplay isnt that complex, very simple infact, well most attacks are charge spams (unless its pvp, then its more complex) on hordes of enemies, this game feels like a mashup of bullet hell and a horde fighter if thats a used therm.

what i hate about it is well, the story didnt finish, to this day i havent heard how the story ends, how my character (or everyone's) saves Haven or something.

Im not sure about the Devs, if they have enough money or if theyre barelly able to pay rent, but i really wish to know how the story ends.

what could save this game is a workshop for items and such, hell maybe even map creators

all wraped up, i do and dont recommend this game, more like a ""your own risk thing"" due to the main story not being finished."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"A roguelike action-mmo thing with a light story, simple but fun combat mechanics with enough depth to keep things interesting, and a charming art style. Great for 1-2 hour play sessions of light dungeon crawling, looking for the next item you need to alchemize a cool sword. Also makes a good co-op game, as it's easy to pick up for new players.

Admittedly haven't reached the endgame, but that's not really why I play Spiral Knights."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,quite a gem
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"The hat is pretty good
Looks pretty fly on spy"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,this game has great potential i recommend this game if you like multiplayer online games its really good !
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,this is a nice dungeon crawled with swords guns and pets. its pretty fun:D
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,Is greatly fun but difficult to get the full 5 star armor
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,downloaded it - get the tf2 hat - delete
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"SK is a good game .
Also it give u hat for some achievements .."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"It has been closing on me each time it opensight just be, but it might just be me but i do recemond this great game!"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,this game is very good but as well it would be much better if we could get a bigger dlc for this game cause it been 5 years since the realeased of operation crimson hammer and it really fun as you go through all king of enemys and all new floors but would be nice if there were the water temple that was suppose to be realeased and better weapon instead of being stuck at max rank maybe increased rank
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"This game is a thing, mostly it is enjoyable thanks to the gameplay and controls, also the artstyle it's really cute, even when it's a spooky theme, there are a lot of ways to play and a big variety of types of weapons, it can be really fun to go on levels testing stuff and seeing all kinds of monsters and themes
But sadly the community is dying, the developers are nearly not updating the game anymore and there are less and less players online, what kills the market inside the game, making getting stuff like vanity items really hard and making up your knight costume is one of the best things to do in the game
Although I still recommend it, specially to play with friends, but in the current situation, the game is only enjoyable for a few days"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"A great game, I remember playing this when I was just a kid. I played through the stand alone launcher for a long time before moving to steam. 

However, the Devs have taken it in a different direction and I personally don't like some of the changes. Id still recommend giving it a shot though."

Besides, the developers had left the game, they're never adding nothing, just sth like useless cloth, they only focus on get money

Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,F
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,Actually I don't even know I think you can craft something or build your town I guess
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,the reaon i played this game was for the hat in tf2 otherwise i hated it
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"i love this world 

i love these mobs 

i love the way it all looks

i love the way it makes you ask yourself, what more am i missing? 

this was mass effect before i knew about mass effect.

i love the way you dont quite know what you are, you wear armor yet your eyes are like LED lights, are you a robot? are you a mind like any other but moved into a machine body? 

it leaves so many things just in sight but to far to make out quite what it is. it feels alive.

ive met good people in this game, anyone who tells you all the players are ♥♥♥holes is a lier.



but the light is fading.

the other knights are leaving, not very fast, but they are still leaving. i too have left, but i come back and hang around hoping for goodnews about the game coming back to life.

the devs as far as i know have more or less jumped ship. nothing grand and new is coming, just ruins and rust will remain after a point.

they made a world that i have gone to bed and thought ""man i wish i was in spiral knights, that'd be so cool"" before falling asleep.

this game is the first and last of its kind. no other like it. some say its like the legend of zelda, i call bull♥♥♥♥. some say its like the binding of isaac, i say your wrong.

honestly, i find it very sad that this game will be forgotten. and only remembered by the hat it has in TF2, and the thing is i know after reading this you will just forget all of what i said but only remember it has a tf2 hat.

i havent played this game since 2015. the game will be dust by 2019, if it isnt ill be shocked and happy.

you ever see the ""I've Seen Things"" no mans sky trailer? well this isnt anything like no mans lie, but it is what it should of been.

so play the fucking game, its free. 

remember the game, remember me, remember the good times you will have with your friend that you do and dont have right now in this game.

i cant say i recommend the game as its slowly turning to dust, only way to save it now is a huge youtuber doing a video on it, but its still a good game and you should still play it.




edit: the year is 2019, and SK is still standing."

Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,This game isn't already dead?
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"Lets be honest, you played this for the tf2 hat"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,................
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"Spiral knights.... Where to begin? 
Probably one of the best Free MMO's to come out of the early days, the game has it's flaws.
But between the pay-to-win garbage you can see glimpses of true brilliance. It's far from a bad game, and it has aged very well but... It's honestly a tragedy. The feeling of the old-school zelda games combined with fast-paced bullet hell, and some very creative and rewarding gameplay variance, all of this is there just mired under time and added on pay-to-win. Trinkets are a good idea, extra weapons slots? not really as the dichotimy of the three weapons types mean two is enough for everyone who aint a munchkin but the price for what you need is not too high, it is not unreachable in normal play- far from it. It just isn't instant. It takes a lot less time to farm then in many MMO's for most things you will need too.
This is probably one of my favorite games, but is also the single most I have ever been dissapointed by a game. Trinkets could have totally changed play-style by adding unique abilities like out Spirits do, but as it is they are a sub-par extra chunk of armor that costs real money to rent slots to wear it. Things like that, glimpses of true brilliance through the murk. I know it's there somewhere."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"What this game lacks in grit and mastery, it more than makes up for with sheer joy. It may be a little cutesy for the average gamer, but anyone who gives it a chance will likely find themselves engrossed. I may only have .6 hours in the game via steam, but I have logged a couple hundred on the character previously.

It's no masterpiece of media, but it's a blast to play."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,One of the best free-to-play MMOs I have tried! It's not a pay-to-win like many I've seen. Things seem to run pretty smooth. Players are very active and there are always things to do. Great game!
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"Don't get me wrong here, the game is really nice, but the plot is so cliche I can predict what the person would say next. Not only that but you'd get bored in 50 hours. Anywho, what this review is trying to say is that the plot of the story is a bit too cliche."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"I installed the game just to get the Spiral Sallet for TF2, but it turned out to be a really fun game. Although there aren't as many players online as there used to be, I think the game still has a decent amount of active players."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,I always liked the cartoony aesthetic and it's a real timekiller.
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,really love this game the game itself got some pretty good items and all that stuff
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"I don't see why anyone would want to play this game.
It's so casual? It has no depth. 
There's no growth or strategy. 
Idle games are more rewarding."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"played this game for the hat

Its fun tho the letter Mr.Hale's sends you seems funny"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,This game is really cute and entertaining! I love how the monsters aren't super creepy but at the same time they are somewhat cute (but very hard to beat). I really enjoy that there is some value to certain items and that the is a storyline to the game. Very fun and addicting!
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"Takes everything good about Zelda games, adds it's own unique spin on it with added RPG elements and randomized levels. The customizability, crafting and levels to items adds another layer of challenge since you'll have to balance your collected resources with how powerful you can make your items. It's also one of the few MMO I can play with my game controller! It's truely an awesome game! :)"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"hello
"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,the best spiral warriors in very cute ..( i dont really what to say but i like it ) keep it up more awesome updates
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"Welcome to Spiral Knights! Now, before I write this review, I'm going to tell you that if you don't like dungeons, grinding, or playing with friends, then you should probably look for another game. This game is solely based upon teamwork, puzzles, and hard-to-kill monsters. Theres a mission-based system in the game, and some of it is very hard to get to unless you pay for it. Such as, If i needed 9 advanced orbs to make some gear that i had to have in order to get promotion, It would be insanely hard to find them in the Clockworks.(Dungeon) So therefore, unless you are a master at survivability and grinding, you would most likely pay for the orbs. This game is incredible, its gone through some good and bad changes, (Mostly good) but it will always be my favorite dungeon game. its incredible how much you can do in Spiral Knights, and you can almost NEVER see the same level if you go into Dungeon mode. 10/10"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"this game is really good, i strat playing with the game and i could not come away from it so i highly recommend this to all the people who come acros this game"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"It's a fan and simple game, the controls are great, graphics i enjoy, and the self held economy in the Auction house is a thrill when bidding, i also love the weapon and armor designs too with battle sprites (pets) to help you in times of distress"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"was much fun at a lan party, i can really recommend Spiral Knights as a little beautiful not-so-tryhard but just chill MMO to play with your friends (alone its really not that thrilling..)"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"Would I recommend this game to someone? Entirely up to you. But do note that the grind, if you want said item, you need to work for it, it's not going to come to you, you have to come to it. I recently came back to it out of boredom, because I simply had no game to play. Pretty fun with friends though"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"Used to play this game everyday as a kid, now there is not many players playing this game but still a pretty fun game :)"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,It's really fun. This is my review. Go home now.
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,Fun cartoon game
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"Very, very, very fun. Great for people getting into PC/laptop gaming. Doesn't use too much RAM, also. AND, THIS IS ALL FREE!!!"

FINAL FANTASY® XI: Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition,Massively%20Multiplayer,230330,"Don't let my steam hours fool you. I have 1797 days, 7 hours and 40 minutes of play time.
This game is still to this day receiving updates. The End game on this game is nothing like i've ever played in my life.
If you want to lose your soul and life time playing this, i highly recommend."
FINAL FANTASY® XI: Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition,Massively%20Multiplayer,230330,"            I just want to start off saying I have never played this game before, nor did I ever know of it's existence until recently. That being said I also have more hours than it shows, but the steam version only shows launcher time. Now this game is a real treasure in the sense that it checks all my boxes for an rpg game, with mmo elements. Something that i've wanted for a while, given how the current mmo genre is not my cup of tea at all. I love the exploration, the need to pay attention to quests, difficult overworld (Mmo's just don't care about making the overworld even remotely challenging anymore, really defeats the need to ever set foot in most of them), and the old school combat system. Normally i'd like a more quick action paced combat, but i feel the old school variant really allows for party cooperation/mechanics to mix in well, and fits the theme of the game overall better. That being said this game does require party elements to really survive, and I absolutely love that. Mmo's tend to not really need anyone to play with until you hit endgame instanced content (dungeons, raids, etc.) which in my opion defeats the whole purpose of having a massively multiplayer game. However don't worry, if being forced to find friends/strangers is not your cup of tea then you can just enlist npc's into your party as a link system. If you do like social interaction though, don't worry. This game isn't dead, and if you choose the right server you can find a great deal of ppl, and even starter zone ppl. I play on odin and i've found an endless amount of players.
            
           

              Now all that being said there are definitely some cons that could be deal breakers for some (Personally they barely phase me). One being the game does not hold your hand. It will not give quest markers, crafting ideas, or much description of a vast part of the game. This can require a great deal of wiki/player help to cover this (Very akin to an rpg called, ""Morrowind""). Also you will die often on your own, and it can take a while to get a variety of skills, and not just rely on auto attacks. Nothing hurts more than dying deep into exploration and not only losing xp (only after lvl 31), but also being sent all the way back to you last home point. Then there's the elephant in the room, yes the graphics are really dam dated. We're talking ps2 here, so temper those expectations. However the music being as old as it is, is quite soothing/wonderful. All in all if you want to play an rpg that suits that child like expectations of an mmo that you make friends, and go on dangerous adventures all over a mythical and engaging world, then this is your game.
                  

             Finally, actually playing the game can be a touch more tedious, but not as bad as most ppl make it out to be. First download game, and make a square enix account if you haven't. Then go to this link http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/index.shtml , and click on, ""square enix account management system"" at the top right. Log into your square enix account. Click on the final fantasy XI, and then click on, ""add new play online service account"". This will require the cd code from steam, that you can find if you press on the cog wheel (settings) for the game in your library. Now you'll notice while making the account some funky gmail, idk if you can, but to my knowledge you can't change that email. Don't worry though your SE account email will be linked to ffXI. Also make sure you take a picture of the password and such, or save the email that was sent with the info, just in case. So after you make the account go to options list and now you can go about changing your password and such. You will also have to make a character by clicking, ""add new options"" under the character part. This will also require your card info. If you got this off steam you do get 30 days free trial, but on the 20th day you'll get billed if you didn't  cancel it, also every character slot makes your subscription $1.00USD extra. Now that you're done with that go back to the accounts page, and here you can click on add a service account, and add the codes from steam that  give the choccobo outfit and the hat to get the rewards. After all that go to the game and launch it (If you closed it). It will say something on the lines of, ""update your play online account"" click it and log into your play online (the register option won't work). type in the info, and the member ID is something not made yet so don't freak out that you can't find it. Just type in what you want your play online member name to be. After which you'll log in and have your play online account, and the rest is pretty straight forward. Another piece of advice when launching the game from steam if you choose the bottom option of the three (the configure one) you can change the settings there. Make the game full screen if you want, and if you want a controller to work you do it through there. Also for controller make sure you check the xinput box to make all the button configures into the actual inputs/button names and not just numbers. I wish you all good luck, and if you bought the game I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"
FINAL FANTASY® XI: Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition,Massively%20Multiplayer,230330,"this game shows its age, in its subtle ways of lack of convenience features, its sometimes awkward conversations with NPCs, archaic map and controller options, but these are not deal breakers. these are not negatives. they just are. its has a higher learning curve, especially as someone whos never played an MMO but i have found enjoyment therein. its recommended that you read up some wikis, approach the community and ask questions to become familiar and learn about the game. once you do, its an enjoyable experience. i know it says ive only played about 30 minutes, but its more like 20 as of this writing. the steam game counter is busted.
do be aware that creating a playonline account and even starting the game is also a convoluted hassle, but is ultimately worth it. i would say FFXI is still worth it in 2021. even if only as a relic of a bygone age."
FINAL FANTASY® XI: Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition,Massively%20Multiplayer,230330,"I started playing XI for the first time about a year ago. It was one of the most immersive and enjoyable experiences I've had in years. That being said this game loves to be difficult for difficulty's sake. This game is FF's take on Ever Quest and once you understand that it becomes easier to take it as it is and just enjoy the experience. 

From here I'll break my review into 3 parts: Pro's, Stuff to Be Aware of, and Con's. I don't think of the StbAo section as a con's list but rather just some warnings about what to expect from a 20 y/o game so as to have clearer expectations. 

~*~*Pro's:~*~*
-Deep Progression Systems. You have your level for your class, stats you increase via use and at end game various stats you can further boost via point currencies earned in the place of EXP. 
-Large roster of playable classes from the Final Fantasy series. 
-Amazing music. 
-Meaningful loot. So many pieces of gear can be used to create sets tailored to whatever play-style you prefer.
-Immersive world with multi layer zones. I feel as if I'm always discovering something new in each zone I visit in this game.
-The story is good. Each expansion is it's own story-line and each one is good with memorable moments and characters. 

~*~*Stuff to Be Aware of:~*~*
-20 year old graphics. You can and you should mod the game using Ashenbubs HD's mod pack for the game. 
-You will need add-on's to make the game a more enjoyable play esp at end game. Windower is the big add-on manager for the game and makes it much easier to do. 
-Combat is slow. Most ppl will be used to things like WoW or Black Desert which have very snappy, fast combat. This is not fast. It's slow due to various mechanics built into it to make it better for creating synergies between various party members. 
-Everything is obscured. There are no quest markers, no indicators to point you in any direction, nothing. You will be using the wiki to figure everything out even so much as to how to unlock jobs. 

~*~*Cons:~*~*
-Real world timers. There are some parts of the game that have unlocks behind real world time gates. They're few but they exist and when you come across one they suck.
-Monthly subscription of $12 USD.  Do note that they do a Free Login Campaign every few months where you can play for usually a week to 2 weeks for free. While the game gets a monthly update I would say they're too small and Square Enix should just bundle the monthly fee with XIV's or get rid of it altogether."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"I finally decided to leave a review of this game after seeing the AMA on Reddit, because I want to support these guys any way I can. Everything about this game makes you happy. Everyone's always smiling (because your character can only smile), other players are extremely friendly (its totally normal for people to compliment you or congratulate you if you hit them in paintball), and the devs are just as feel-good as the game itself. They are extremely responsive to the community and really have a way of making everyone feel special. I sent Against Gravity an email recently, and the response I got came back less than six hours later not from some intern, but from the CEO. And in the AMA, when someone asked how they could support the company financially, the response was to instead to make a donation to charity and to ""tell 'em coach sent ya"". They're small gestures, but it really shows that they care.


In a world where it seems like we are constantly being bombarded with negativity, and where everyone is divided, this game is like a haven of positivity. Much like the reviews, the game itself is ""overwhelmingly positive"""
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"best VR game ever. WHY ARE ALL THE FREE GAMES THE BEST ONES? there ain't even any forced micro-transactions! 
lots of re-playability, tons of fun. would definitly (rec)omend, eh? eh? no? ok i'll be over here, in the dark corner."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Damn, this game has everything you could ever want in a VR game! Ok, granted, it does not have EVERYTHING a VR game has to offer, but it comes close! The experience you get from this game is awesome. The community is great, you can play with friends, and with the new addition of Quest, lots of fun games to choose from! And on top of that, the game is free and the developers actually respond and change the game according to the playerbase! Best multyplayer VR game, hands down. Infinity/10"

Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Rec Room – I cant believe its free!
I think this game is overlooked by some people but if you spend some time inside you it becomes a real Gem.
I notice on vrlfg website that there are more players online around the clock than most multiplayer VR games.
It has been under continous development improving more and more every month.
When you first start the game there is a computer where you can add all your steam friends.
With your wrist watch you can easily change games servers, invite friends etc.
My favorites: Paintball, Jumbotron Quest and Lounge room.
Rise of the Jumbotron Quest: The asthetics of lighting color and sound are the best of any vr game I have seen. It is challenging, but I did beat it 3 times 😊
Paintball: Endless fun. Lounge room: So fun with friends, tell jokes on stage, draw things with the 3d marker, play cards whatever best for private gatherings.
Children under 13 arent allowed and it is very easy to kick using the wristwatch interface."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Gnarly game for free. First time playing VR and I played this game. Met some cool people so far!! Amazing game to met friends!!
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"good, its fun and creative, BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE NERF THE ENIMIES IN QUEST! i keep dying and dying in quest, so add a check point system, some new weapons, or just nerf the flying guys please.
"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,A great game and a great example of what the future of social VR has in store.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Try not to listen to the negative feedback on this game . Depending on what time of the day you play the interactions with people in this game can be a lot of fun . The mini games are great and the overall set up of the dorm and locker I think is pretty darn clever . Fight your way threw dungeouns of ghouls with friends , capture the flag in paintball , and laugh and joke your way threw a game of charades 10/10 .
"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"This game is truly the VR killer-app. It has SO much stuff to do. And it's FREE, FOR GOD'S SAKE! Buy it now and thank me later."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,A great experience. Generally a polite community. The execution of the games is particularly good. Moderators and admins are excellent in-game.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"I strongly recommend this game! it's one of the best online vr games out there + it's free!
i've had so much fun, and i can't stop playing!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"I have played many hours on many games in VR, rec room is by far my favorite game and I felt compelled to write a review. It's free, it's social, it has many mini games which are awesome and addictive. I can only hope they continue to build on the base game they have already because it is amazing. A must have for every VR gamer of all ages."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Very well designed. The visuals are simple yet functional and pleasant. The mechanics are fun and it runs very well.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"This is a fantastic and must-have game if you have a Vive! It's free! 

This game is basically Wii Sports for the VR world, but it's also social. You can talk to other players, and even give them a high five! The fist-bump is used to join a party with them, which I think was pretty neat.

Paintball is challenging, and there are a few small ""invisible walls"" you think you can shoot through, but you just splatter paint. That aside, great game! ..You get the excitement of paintball without the welts.

Disc golf, dodgeball and other games are great fun, I can certainly see myself playing this for quite some time!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"I keep coming back to this, it's the best VR game I have played."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,The Wii Sports Of VR
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Pro's: It's free and it works.  

Cons: Handibot, American children and that one midday drunk guy!  

Enter at your own risk. 

"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Spent a bunch of time just hanging out with some really nice people from around the world in the locker room. One of the most unique and immersive experiences i've had in my whole life of gaming.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Wow, just wow for a free game it realy packs a punch it may actualy be the best game ive played on vr."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,I rate this game 10 running into walls out of 10.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"I've had my HTC vive for 3 days now only. My mind was blown away by team labs already. I was going to go to bed but I just wanted to try one more game befor I went. It was rec room I shouldnt have done that. 1,5 hour later I was still up and had only 5 hours left to sleep.

This game is supresingly fun! You can do all kinds of stuff but the best part is the interaction with other people. Execpt from the few little kids that start screaming all kinds of crap during a game of ""picture it"". Luckily you can either mute them or vote kick them and have fun with the people that do wanna play these types of games.

I threw darts into someones eyes, I wore a trashcan als a hat. Resulting in not seeing a thing. I threw my controller through the room (note to self: always use the wristband) and I slamdunked my ceiling with a virtual basketball!

And its free!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"i wusint for sher if it wed be good but i tride it it wus free its the best game for vr!!!!!! but the game 
wus 13 and up the game is cool but therrs no kids therrs bad pepel but the kids cood mute them 
its a good game but the makers of this game nead to take the 13 and up of"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Would totally recommend Rec room,  always updateing and always improving, even if you don't feel like playing games, it has plenty to offer as chatting and making new friends."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Really no reason to not have this awesome freaking game... just free and social fun!
Rec Room,Sports,471710,hi
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Best VR experience, just stop reading reviews and try it!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"A must have for VR. After playing Quest For The Golden Trophy in Rec Room, I realized that *THIS* is why I purchased a VR headset. <-no lie"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"[h1] Amazing Game and Time Killer!!!!! [/h1]

I love to hang out in this game with others beacuase they ofer paintball here ;) Hanging with people and playing disc golf, shooting hoops, playing ""pong,"" etc. Want to hang with other VR bros, then get this hangout club!!!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,very fun. will be playing again
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Great game.  It's a must have, especially since it's free.

The paintball is particularly addictive."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Always a go to for me, love paintball, Quest is one of the funnest experiences in VR, disc golf is fantastic."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"I went in for less than a hour, but for that whole time I had a smile on my face. It's a really fun game and shows the potential of multiplayer VR. I want more!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Recroom is the big Gem of VR. It's free and probably the best VR game out there right now.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,it ok
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"I think Rec Room should add warning about racial discrimination.
Rec Room is a worldwide VR social game. That's the reason why all of the people from various countries are able to join here.
Unfortunately, there are some children who can't understand about this diversity of people. 
So, their behaviour to foreigners is extremely rude and nasty.
This is the reason why Rec Room should add warning of segregation on the dorm room just like sexual harassment. Additionally, it's not easy to kick them with the voting system.
One of my japanese friend did stop playing Rec Room because these kinds of problems.
So please make warnig of this matter, or please add segregation category in kicking system, and make a list of them.
Rec Room is really popular as the best VR Social Network game, these personal problems must be fixed if Rec Room need to remain for a long time."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Hours of free multiplayer fun. Regularly updated with great new content. If you have a Vive theres no reason not to check this game out
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Amazing place for meeting up with other players who enjoy the VR industri. Paintball and disc golf is my drug at the moment!
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Amazing work, I play this game the most out of my 100 + VR games, definitely my favourite multiplayer experience is the VR paintball in this, so damn fun."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Love playing paintball on REC Room, great game and even better that its free! Definately worth the download and would highly rate this for others."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"A fun, lighthearted game with an actual playerbase."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"One of the most varied, social, and fun VR experiences, all for the low low price of $0. Quest mode in particular is great co-op fun."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,this game is amazing as a free game. and even much better than most paid VR games.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Looks rediculous in screenshots.  But, this game is extremely fun in VR.  Paintball and Questing (especially the archery) games are alot of fun in this title.   Very active multiplayer environment to play with and meet others in VR.  Definatley recommand for VR collection."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"This game is amazing.  Running around doing stupid *(#$ with complete strangers online...  10/10

Its also a really good way to meet other players to join you in other online games."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"This is one of the best VR games ever.  Not really a complaint, but why is this free?  Other games charges a pretty penny for a game such as paintball alone but this game gives you a handful more.  I've wasted hours with this cool game."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Some of the best VR experiences are free.
This is no exception.
Best multiplayer in VR hands down.
Friendly online community.
Easy to get in and get out if you just want a quick play.
A lot of Fun with real people.
I would rather play paintball here than real life paintball."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Probably the best, most positive experience in VR yet. Best of all, it's FREE"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"How is it that the best experiences I've had so far have been for free? Rec Room is a fantastic VR experience! The mini games are fun, the controls work great (learn to swipe left and right to orientate!), and the social aspect is one that I actually enjoy!! Brovo to the developers and please keep up the good work!! I'll gladly pay for an expanded experience!!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"This game is incredibly fun and judging by what's around the environment they plan to add a ton more to do. It already has several mini games to play and the entire community is as friendly as can be. Since all the characters are goofy looking and don't even remotely match the voice that comes through the mic, youre always laughing and smiling. 
Charades and Paintball are by far my favorite, with a friendly, talkative group its a blast!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,I can't believe this is free. It's very social and a lot of fun. Probably my go to game when I want to relax and have a bit of fun.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"The best VR experience that one can play. I would pay a full 30 dollars for a game like this, but it's already free. Stop reading, start downloading."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"This is what VR was mde for, so much fun."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,best vr game ever and with the new game they added I can't believe it's still free
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"The game is free, it is fun, and it offers something different everytime you play. This game is a must have for all who own a vive and is worth your download."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Its one of the best VR games that you can play right now, and its FREE! They are constantly improving the game & adding more stuff, if you own a VR headset, then you should have this game"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,I have played many games on the Vive and this is honeslty the best. The online interaction and fun in this game out of this world. The games on this are very team-based and just so much fun. I hope this application continues to grow because this is a VR dream come true.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"""Omg these people are talking!""
""We can hear you!""
""OMG MY VIVE HAS A MICROPHONE?!?""

10/10 would buy this game if it wasn't for free already!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,This is one of the best VR games and its free! I have had  so much fun and the new Quest For The Golden Trophy game is awesome.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"When I first downloaded this game, I thought surely it would be one of those that gets released then immedietly forgotten. To my suprise, this has quickly become my favorite game not just for the HTC Vive, but my favorite game overall. With the new quest expansion, devs have shown this isn't going anywhere, and is only going to get better.

I only hope now that they'll expand quest mode a bit. It would be nice if you could use all that gold for something."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Great fun, good games, and a brilliant way to orientate yourself in VR"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"This has to be one of my favourite VR titles, it's damn fun, playing VR paintball is intense. I love the new Quest feature, it's damn hard, but it's damn fun!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Wow  the new quest mode is amazing.
Very fun game.  10/10"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,A VR must have!
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Awesome fun
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"OMG, I'm so in love with ""Quest"" (the lil' RPG), I had so much fun in so little time @_@

Thank you so much Gribbly, keep going \o/"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,The new dungeon crawl is AMAZING!  The best experience I've had in VR yet.  And this game is free!!!
Rec Room,Sports,471710,best vr game ever
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"This game is Vive fun... it just is.
 
The makers of this game just seem to get VR and keep making silly fun VR content.

The new co-op quest mode is by far the most fun I’ve had on the VR yet. It provides my need for co-op content and skill based shooter in one very fun game mode. 

And that’s just one mode! If you want more PvP then the bunch of fun skill based games they have can provide you with a very fun and active VR gaming experience.  If you want casual fun then they have that to!

Cheers guys!  

Releah"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,The new quest mode is fantastic. First time I ever damaged a Vive controller.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"One of the best free social/sports app out there and completely free!
Customize your avatar, unlock new outfits, daily objectives, constant updates expanding the game and content.
Highly recommended!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,It is genuinely one of the best times I've had in VR (especially the new Quest). And it's free.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"This game is so GOOOOOOD

AND IT FREE!!!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,This is my most played game and the most well rounded multiplayer experience so far. The Devs seem to constantly be updating and pushing out bug fixes. This is a must have game for all players 13 and over!
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Can't express how amazing this experience is. Can't believe it's free
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"the definition of what vr with friends should be
free to play, hours of fun, tons of shit to do
just open the game, make an avatar, and go play games and meet new people
great game, do reccomend"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Well executed VR multiplay fun.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Amazing that a game like this is free to play, one of the best out there for the Vive.

Since the first time I played it there have been MASSIVE improvements and so much more content is constantly being added, it's crazy to think that they haven't yet thought about a way to monetize the game, I'm glad there are still devs that think about making a great game first and making money second, Against Gravity is clearly a company that focuses on making great games."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Favorite VR game for so many reasons. First off, the devs are incredibly responsive and are constantly listening to what the community base wants. Second, they release new game modes, maps, items, etc. quite often, which keeps the game fresh. Third, you will not find a better VR UI. Seriously. The watch is brilliant. Overall, this thing is just beyond well designed. 

But why are you even reading reviews? It's free- try it!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"One of the best made social VR apps , lacking a bit in ""what to do"" department, however it is constantly evolving.
Big thumb up !"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Fun, free, and easy to play with friends. A good way to try social VR. I recommend it."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,I pretty much play the Rec Room Paintball game more than any other. It's so much fun and similar to the real thing!
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Great choice if ur looking for a social game.I suggest more game modes but this is the place if u want playu with other people.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Super fun and light-hearted game with a good community. Great fun on the VR :)
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Really interesting concepts, played it for about an hour and really enjoyed the time. I also realize that I need a bigger play area in my game room.....who needs a couch?"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Excellent game, and free! Great playability and when the right players are on, a lot of fun. The downside is that sometimes you get childish people on there that can detract a but, but the developers are working hard to minimize it."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Awesome social vr game.
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"By FAR the best VR game i have played and maybe the best i'll ever play. And on top of that, it's FREE!!!

Pros:
Meeting cool people in VR (But also having the option to turn off your and others voices)
Paintball is AMAZING
Disc Golf is a good casual game
Dodgeball is also really good
Graphics are pleazing
3D charades is a nice social game (You have to talk to play it)
Paddle Ball is a fun, quick game
Also you can film INSIDE THE GAME
Shield soccer is also pretty fun
Don't forget you can play basketball, ping pong. and MORE in the lobby!
you can also play cards with people IN VR?!?
and did i mention, ITS FREE!


Cons:
i guess the graphics aren't the best?
...
thats like, all i can think of.

so, YEAH! GET IT NOW!!!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"This is an amazing game.  I wish that the Disc Golf game had more than just one map, but I could play for hours.  Same with Paintball. Ducking behind walls is amazing. Room scale makes this game great."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"If you hate kids you might not like this game at first, but once you've played some disc golf and paintball, their presence doesn't bother you so much anymore cause you're too busy having fun.

It's a good virtual hangout spot as well; really my only complaint is some games are locked away in a private lounge and you need to invite someone (or be invited) to access it. But then again I suppose it's a good spot to chill if you're trying to avoid all the children.

Speaking of which, what parent gives their 8-year-old an $800 piece of sophisticated equipment to play with, anyway? I wish I was this spoiled as a kid..."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,The interactions are well designed and the community is nice!
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Kicked my toe on my lounge dodging a ball in dodgeball
Fell over in pain, swore a lot, then threatened to have a bon fire with said lounge while the lobby laughed about it

10/10 Would stub toe again"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,GREAT FUN SHOOTING AND SOCIAL SPACE
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Easily my favorite game to play in vr. Very fun, easy to play, there's a bunch of different things to do, and best of all its free. This is an absolute necessity if you have a vive.

It's got a 10/10 for a reason, just download it."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"What an amzing game. If this game just had the paintball mode I would easly pay $10. But you have that game and many more for FREE! 
If you have a Vive or Oculus + Touch then pick it up and join the fun!"
Rec Room,Sports,471710,extremely fun experience. especially the paintball (i haven't tried the other games). get it

Post Scriptum,Massively%20Multiplayer,736220,Dead player base and the ones that are there are toxic af
Post Scriptum,Massively%20Multiplayer,736220,"pro tips that will make you the best player ever: 
ALWAYS main base camp, stay within 300 meters of the enemy base to ensure the maximum amount of damage you can inflict on your enemy. Never communicate, that's overrated, and this is basically call of duty so just run at the enemy with no regard for tactics or cover. One man heavy tanks so you can experience all the fun of driving into a ditch and then getting blown up by an enemy commander for not moving. If you pick the squad lead role, don't communicate, never drop rallies, and don't help your teammates, you have an smg, be God and kill all the enemies, you don't need teammates. Don't revive people as a medic, that morphine is for you and you alone. Hip fire the MG's for maximum range and use your AT rockets on infantry only. Most importantly, this game is all about your K/D so don't play the objective."
Post Scriptum,Massively%20Multiplayer,736220,"As of this writing, I consider this a dead game.. virtually no servers and no player base.  Too bad because it had a lot of potential."
Post Scriptum,Massively%20Multiplayer,736220,"This is a really cool game if you like cooperating with a large group of people. If you're into FPS Battle Royal, Deathmatch, you're not going to be into this. Make sure you have a good headset and mic, and get ready to have your mind blown with realistic WW2 gaming! I love it, even though I suck at it!"
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"Early Access (far from finished) MMO that now offers a QoL monthly subscription comparable in price to that of FFXIV, ESO, and WoW. Effectively now indie game or not with its current monetization model and price it is competing alongside those previously mentioned games while not being remotely in the same league.
 
This game was already incredibly niche, now potential new players are going to look at the price for entry and compare and contrast it with the genre giants. This change effectively gated off an already niche game community, pushing away potential new players for the ability to further monetize the niche community. 

If you are looking for a new MMO I can safely say to skip this game, while it has an interesting skill system it was arguably already overpriced at its base box price, the inclusion of a monthly subscription while still being early access says more about the game than I ever could."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,The new VIP-system is not justified given the state of the game in early access (might never make it out of it!). Usually this indicates the end state of a game where the still remaining player base is milked dry before the game completely shuts down.
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"There is so, so much to like about Project: Gorgon. Unfortunately with all the good things, come equally bad things.

There are a ton of great ideas in the game, but great ideas don't thrive without good execution, and the execution in Project Gorgon is it's constant weakness. There isn't a single amount of polish in the game to be found. Every feature, ability, animation, dialogue line, icon, feels like a first iteration, and it adds up to ""death by a thousand cuts"". In it's attempt to stretch to typical MMO heights, the general world suffers. To paraphrase Bilbo Baggins, ""It feels like butter scraped across too much bread"".

I understand that this is a perpetual Early Access game, but the rough edges are egregious and they permeate every aspect of of the experience. It's typically explained away by the community with claims of the art being placeholder, and the fact it's a two person development team, or that there's no ""hand holding"".

And those are impressive feats, to even have an MMO running, but overall it's not quite enough. There's not a single system that doesn't feel riddled with bugs or general jank. While it does possess a certain amount of old school charm to it, it mostly feels like a crutch. And at the end of the day, those come across as excuses. Excuses for constant bugs in the most basic systems, excuses for horrendous performance, questionable animations, lack of a cohesive art style.

The game has a fantastic community, with the caveat of that fantastic community mainly exists within the game itself, and as long as you don't approach criticism of the game. Just look at new player posts on the forums, steam, or Reddit. You'll find established players blaming users for not knowing things that are obvious to someone with hundreds of hours in the game, yet the whole game is based around the concept of obscurity. 

The wiki says, ""hey this game is about exploration, don't look at the wiki"", but then folks are lambasted for not using the wiki. There's a certain air of Stockholm Syndrome and an air of a club who is ""in the know"". Understandable when folks spend thousands of hours in it's thousands of skills. Having thousands of skills is great, but if you don't know what the synergies are, how can you build a character and ""play how you want"", which is another one of it's claims.

That being said, there is fun to be had. There are unique systems to experiment with. There are cool ideas. I spent 45 hours in the demo, and another 40 since I bought the game, and I have definitely gotten that value from it.

Will I keep playing it? It's less and less everyday. I can feel my enthusiasm wane as the rough edges keep popping up to wear me down. Unlike say, the Souls series, I don't feel mastery emerging from the jank as I play, I just feel the flaws more and more. And that's why I can't recommend it at this point.

However, [b]I do recommend you grab the demo[/b], and do recommend you spend some quality time on the newbie island. You may be far more forgiving than me, and you may be able to find the diamond in the rough like a few hundred others have. 

And like many others in it's near decade long development, I will keep an eye on it, and hope it makes it to a better place where I can find that balance."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"Project Gorgon is an MMORPG that should be perfect for me, given the developers having past experience with Asheron's Call -- my favorite MMORPG of all-time. When I purchased this a couple of years ago, I expected a modern take on the Asheron's Call formula, with a heavy focus on world exploration and lore. Unfortunately, this game fails to take it's lore too seriously, with lots of items with joke names and quests that are silly, and the world itself lacks the random, meaningful finds of AC.

It's not a terrible MMORPG and for someone seeking an old school MMORPG experience that's similar to EverQuest, this game might be a good choice. There are lots of skills to develop, plenty of areas to explore, and quite a bit of flexibility in how you approach the game.

For me personally, Project Gorgo ns a title that suffers from ""Black Desert Online syndrome"", where an MMORPG appears to offer the list of features that are important to me yet somehow the finalized project just isn't entertaining to me. Had it taken it's lore a bit more serious and structured the content more tightly as to feel more like it's connected in a meaningful way, it could at least have been a serviceable MMORPG for me. It ended up just being playable and mediocre for me, and one that I will potentially return to a few years in the future to see how it's progressed but definitely not one I'd recommend."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,Ya well new it was coming [VIP] they need to make money some how but like others have said the game runs like crap and looks like crap even on the latest hardware out or old hardware which says one thing they don't know what they are doing.  Hopefully their new hired help can save them and they know how optimize this game so it can at least play. Right now it is like a rubber-band game lagged the fuck out.  I mean if it was playable maybe people might want to subscribe until then I think it is unfair to introduce this system at least wait until you make the game work
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"As much as I did enjoy it back in the day, I cannot -in good conscience- recommend this to anyone. 
The game was created to a niche audience, it had charm despite the overall quality. Really liked almost everything about it.
The addition of VIP was mentioned, I'll give them that (except it was nowhere on Steam, so if you didn't dig around beforehand; surprise!). 
To honestly think you can charge people this much for a game of this quality with an added subscription is ambitious, if anything. 

This decision of theirs while can be excused if it's a funding problem (which it isn't, they said so themselves), is extremely poor. Dividing your already small & niche playerbase is never a good move. Hope it goes well for them but for me? I'm out."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"An early access indie mmo with a very slow update cycle, unfinished animations, placeholder textures and an optional monthly subscription to improve the games quality of life, comparable in price to most 'finished' AAA mmos.

While it does have one of the best skill systems I've ever had the pleasure of playing with, I can't justify the prices asked for when there is such a glacial update speed and such a poor comparison to it's market competition for similar prices.

As it stands you'll get more value for money from another mmo but I recommend the demo and seeing for yourself if it's for you."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"Absolutely immersive game that I really want to see succeed. People are complaining about the optional vip subscription which gives you a few more inventory slots, character slots, and a small amount of rested xp. It is not pay to win like people are saying. There is no in game shop. If you want to play a pay to win game go play the numerous free to play mmos out there where they will actually force you to sub to get anywhere. The sub in this game is merely for those who want to continue to support the game's development very much like a patreon subscription. It's a small game run by two people. There are a lot of armchair quarterbacks complaining here. Don't listen to them."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"Bought it today
i know Steam Summer sale is in 2 weeks but WOW i just couldn't wait...amazing so far, love it! Great Job Dev Team :)"
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"Nearly 1000 hours full of monster slashing and leveling the many skills like hammer, sword, shield, firemagic, battle chemistry, staff, carpenter, cooking, alchemy, mining, treassure hunting and many more. Enjoying a lot of hours with my friends here in this game at the weekends reaching our goals at our gaming days or after a nice BBQ in the saturday evening. Still, we have many goals to fullfil and we hope for even more content in the future. I love it that there is a VIP membership now. The developers deserve the monthly treat and as advertised, there will be money going into developing the game. If you are searching for a nice and especially good crafted old school roleplay game that combines many classes to push each other with extra benefits you will love it. The start is easy, the mastering is hard work. But, work that will give you hours, days, even weeks and month of joy. Who better to say than a guy that is around 1000 hours in this game as well as his friends are.
To the team behind Project: Gorgon: Guys, I love your product. It is written with so much heart for details and it just feels like a game that is different to all the stereotype roleplays out there. With about 15 roleplaying games I played over the last 15 years, there have been two which I played that many hours. Yours and LOTRO (but, as LOTRO sucks today, I was searching for a game like yours for  many years until I finally found it :) A new home for my little gamer heart."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,Subscription to get rid of annoying things that could be fixed
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"I played this game for about 40 hours, its was old graphics but decent game play and a great idea.... Then I was turned into a cow... I spent another 30 hours trying to undo this change to no avail. I contacted the in game help, Zero help. they tell you you need a potion, but you're a cow now and can't make potions or talk to anyone, or use anything. LOL you're a cow now, and the 40 hours of fun gaming you had is lost. I started a new character after that, but soon fell into the thought that it would happen again.  I shut the game off and never bothered with it again. Its Sad really. great idea! Terrible mechanics and lack of clear instruction for almost anything quest related. :("
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"I wanted to enjoy this. I managed to suffer through only a handful of monotonous hours of bland quests and the mob grinding ever present within the genre only to succumb to the boredom before seeing what the game can offer. 

Maybe this is why they're also tacking on a subscription; to tax the already enfranchised. I can't imagine their numbers of new players growing at any substantial rate."

[b] Pros: [/b]
+ Tons of things to buy in the In Game Store. (No Pay To Win)
+ Lots of different color skins for your mouse. 
+ Lots of Maps.
+ You get ranked with all the other players and can see your ranking among them.
+ Funny sometimes.

[b] Cons: [/b]
- The Community is really messed up.
- Never go on the Cafe...trust me...
- Lots and lots and LOTS of Rage quits. 
- Also lots of blaming your FPS.

[b] Review [/b]
       Transformice...what can I say about it... Well, you are a mouse. Which isn't that great, but the real amazing thing is that you chase after cheese all day.  Literally my biggest dream that I never told anyone. Some may make fun of me for the amount of time I played, but I say if I could chase after cheese in real life I would spend more than a few couple hundred hours on it. You know what makes it even better? It's free! Free Cheese! And you know everything free tastes better. It's hard for new people to like it because it's pretty difficult to be able to even get the cheese in the first place, but once you get that cheese, everything changes. You just want to get that cheese again and again. Life is going good; all the cheese you can get your little grubby little paws on. Then BOOM, it hits you, you realize it, you finally realize that the cheese you love is full of MSG and you can't stop even if you wanted to... It all spirals out of control at this point. Am I a mouse or human??? I don't even know anymore. I need to go get some more cheese. Yes, cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE!!!

Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,"Good game for sure, a nice way to meet new people, or have a heavy argument with serious people, which is totally cool for me 👌🏼 Also, sometimes i get to play it at school, does that mean im addicted? Maybe.

If i had to choose a game, for a quick play, i would totally go for Transformice 👍🏼
Have fun with other people, act like a try hard and just kill the time o/

Lately, the game have alot of restarts and updates, which pisses off people SO much, but i understand Atelier801 team, they try their best to make the game much enjoyable for us, so keep up the GOOD work guys! o/"
Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,"I've been playing this game since 2010, and it is easily my favorite game to play to pass time. I think between the site and steam I've put in around 700-1,200 hours. I always come back to it, and it never disappoints me. It requires patience, patience, and more patience. I recommend taking advatage of the fact that you can block other mice, and invite as many friends as possible. :'> It's easy to lose a few hours and wonder where the time went to if you're playing with the right people. Apparently, you caan even play as Pokemon now. So that's pretty cool too.

Add me: Sorceress"

Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,shitty game
Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,"
English:
It is a nice game to play if you feel a little childish and also a great game to pass time with. You can meet new friends from all over the world and play. Join a tribe, collect cheese. Maybe you just love building your own maps. Well you will never know until you try it out!


Swedish:
Det är ett trevligt spel att spela om du känner dig lite barnslig och även ett bra spel att fördriva tiden med. Du kan träffa nya vänner från hela världen och spela. Gå med i en stam, samla ost. Kanske du bara älskar att bygga egna kartor. Tja du kommer aldrig att veta förrän du prova det!"

Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,It's a pretty simple game where you chase the cheese and bring it to the wholes. So many rooms to try too. Relaxing and laid back unless some shitty players try to kick you out of the map. Otherwise it's fun. I'd play it everyday :D

[h1]The game.[/h1]
[i]Transformice[/i] is a 2D platform multiplayer game where you control a mouse who are trying to gather cheese and bring it back to the hole.

[h1]Gameplay.[/h1]
The gameplay is simple and the mechanics seems well-made. Graphically speaking, the game is simple and appealing.

You play as a mouse along with a bunch of other people and try to get the cheese with the help of the shaman, a special mouse that has powers that allow him to construct structures to help the mice get the cheese. You could also buy cosmetics with the cheese.

Theres a level up system that gives the shaman ridiculously overpowered abilities that allow them to single out people they like and complete the level for them and kill everyone else, which is usually what happens. Besides that, to this there is enough brony pandering to sink a ship, from cosmetics to maps based off the show.

The community isn’t very good, is really appalling, and now mostly consists of memelords and bronies. Each server is full of people saying “#@?* you” and “noob” and plenty of other insults.

Although this game doesn’t fascinate me (I confess), the game itself isn’t really bad. It's the community that makes this game not really fun to play. Looks like a bunch of kids of about 10 years old talking nothing but crap. Not recommended much because of the community. [u]If you play this with a couple of friends on a private server, I think it could become quite nice to play.[/u]

[quote][h1]Positive points. (+)[/h1][list]
[*]Free-to-play.
[*]Very low system requirements.
[*]Trading cards.
[*]Simple gameplay.
[*]Neat graphics.
[*]Pretty mechanics.
[*]Variety of modes keeps gameplay fresh.
[*]Good to play with friends.
[/list][/quote]

[quote][h1]Negative points. (-)[/h1][list]
[*]The community is really disrespectful.
[*]Maybe boring after a short time (at least for me).
[*]Terrible tutorial. I'm forced to rush into gameplay not knowing what to do and what the icons mean, etc.
[*]Shaman decide the games outcome, help your friends and destroy all other players; great aspect but also very bad.
[*]A lot of time waiting to restart.
[/list][/quote]

Well, it's a free game, I know. But adding these factors it's nonetheless a bad game. Personally, after a while, I found the game tedious and quite annoying; unnistaled."
Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,"Though very simple, this game is extraordinarily fun when playing as mouse, experiencing their life in this game."
Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,"I love this game~
Seriously~
It's one of those ""An hour to learn/A lifetime to master"" kind of things.
The premace?  You and your mouse brothers and sisters (well, mainly just YOU!) need to get the cheese and get to the hole without plummeting to an undesirable death.
Against you are an assortment of traps, pitfalls, the other mice, and your own timing.
At first, it's a simple platformer, but the moves can get pretty advanced.  You can pull some really amazing stuns and leaps with proper timing and technique!
Additionally, during the platform maps, one mouse is the ""Shaman"" mouse, who has powers to build and place all kinds of nifty tools, platforms, spells, balloons~  all kinds of things to help all the mice get successfully to the cheese and back to the hole.  You level up your shaman too, learning new spells and tricks to get everyone from A-B.
It's free, it's fun, and there's always room to grow in your technique and Shaman Tree with all kinds of avatar cutsomization (costs Cheese to upgrade)
Play eet~"
Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,"For being free, this game is very well-done. The fact that it is Massively Multiplayer and is so captivating is otherworldy. I just started playing and I am already addicted. I want to be the very best!"
Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,NICE :D

I've played the entire game."
Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,"Pros: This game was my childhood 
Cons: I'm a furry now"
Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,"This game is okay. It's a fun way to waste a few minutes, but it quickly becomes repetitive and boring, not to mention the fact that the shaman rarely does anything and is even less likely to do anything productive. Furthermore the community in this game is terrible. It ranges from low level hate to swearing, bigotry and personal attacks.

Overall, I may play this game again, but I will not recommend it to anyone."
Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,"Cute, adventures, very guuud. I'd say the only bad thing is teaching, the game doesn't teach new players enough information and tactics. However, maybe that's just how the game works, letting the player learn by themself."
Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,"failed as shaman

got called a noob

thought life over and how roasted i got

played again

got cheese and took it to the hole

11/10 would take cheese to the hole again"

Transformice is a very addictive game if you like this type of games.
It is also a social game where you can make a lot of friends. Various uptades maintain the game alive. 

This game is a part of my childhood and i will never forget it.

Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,"this game I give a 50% not enuf documentation, players are jerks, BUT, very interesting concept, design, and implimentation... the playerbase tho, all jerks... well, I would imagine SOMEONE out there might offer help, but, after playing for the time I played, I finally decided to make my OWN room, and just start expirimenting to figure it out.

Transformice,Massively%20Multiplayer,335240,"As a hardcore player of AJ (look it up im a lazy bum) i have thoroughly enjoyed the genius concept of being a mice and racing with other mices to get to the the cheese. The added bonus of adding music and shit posting in music servers really makes this game stand out. I also enjoy how you can customise your mice and make them emo and have crippling depresion. The regular updates introduce a whole new theme to the game and even ocasional update-specific maps! Astonishing!

- Maps have misplaced props, and sometimes misplaced terrain as you could see under them into nothingness, but they will definitely fix this in the future and didn't really affect my enjoyment.

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
- The playerbase is really low right now and it's a really big shame for a game with such potential, but In my opinion, the progression and customization system will hugely help to keep players invested more in the game, me included. The game is still in Early Access so it still has lots of time to grow a playerbase.
- Optimization is not the best currently, but hopefully, it may be improved upon in the future
- Sometimes people doesn't speak at all, just rushing at points like they were playing Battlefield 1
- Some crashing issues
- The price of the game is a bit expensive right now with how much content it currently offers, but the game is still expanding don't forget that! Me personally, I got it on a sale.

[b][u]Tip(s):[/u][/b]
- Don't turn on the ""Fully Load Textures"" option as it crashes your game a ton, after I've turned it off it made crashes less frequenr.

[b]8/10[/b] Currently in this Early Access state it's still a really amazing WW1 tactical shooter with huge potential and I am very hopeful for the future of this game."
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"I really like this game. They've clearly put a lot of effort into it and what they've made is really good.

It desperately needs bots. Players would be better, but devs can't make players. They can make bots.

Dear devs, make bots.

If you liked Verdun, you'll like Beyond the Wire. If you've not played Verdun, give this a go. Not only is it well-designed and well-produced, there are precious few games about the Great War and it deserves to be remembered."
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"Ugly.  That's how this game makes fighting feel.  The ugly dispassionate industrialisation of war rings out as you try to steady your handgun, be it Webley or Luger, as you take a crack at the enemy you stumbled upon during a trench run.  Perhaps he shoots back.  Or perhaps he dashes at you, wooden club at the ready, as you struggle to land your shots.  In a woodland edge elsewhere, a soldier spots an unsuspecting enemy crossing a wheat field.  He lines up a shot, and blinded by the crack and smoke of his rifle, he looks eagerly to discern whether he hit his quarry.  Perhaps he did hit him.  Perhaps his adversary instead heard the shot and sought the cover of the wheat.  He fixes bayonet as he begins to comb the field for the body.  Bayonets elsewhere too are fixed, in a forrest, where the line of battle obscures into chaos, as a skirmish ensues.  Artillery from an unknown direction falls, shuttering the soldiers as gunshot and bayonets meet.  

Some say the movement is clunky, which it is, but it takes getting used to to appreciate it.  It makes the game feel more gritty and tough.  It puts the emphasis on the experience of soldiering in the heat of combat, rather than having perfect crisp control of your character and weapons, as is with other games.  In reality you were indeed but a conscripted man in the years 1914-18 who left his village to fight in a trench, and if you found yourself lucky enough to reach the enemy line alive during an attack, you were forced with the challenge of engaging them up close in all the clutter and bedlam.  Or maybe you like to take your time with your shots, lining them up.  Sometimes nothing can be more satisfying than landing a headshot with a Luger from 50 meters distance and hearing the ping of the bullet hitting the helmet.  

One thing i found disappointing was the objectives.  On one hand, it simulated well the need to capture sectors and storm or hold a line.   On the other, it kind of eliminates the freedom of games like squad and post scriptum whose objectives were more vague and area specific, forcing players and squads to communicate, plan and interact more.  I feel like that is a major loss of value.  I understand things differ in a ww1 setting and they tried to better represent the back and forth line battles, but it should be about striking a balance which currently feels too much in favour of objectives that require more piling up than team work to attack/defend.  It's then moving closer to verdun or battlefield, which is unfortunate for this series of games.  I would recommend making objectives larger rather than just groups of smaller points and not so easy to capture as though it were a battlefield game.  This recommendation of course is centered on the preference of teamwork over easier more instant gameplay.  

It is fairly well optimised, but of course on some maps there is some noticeable lag, among other smaller things.  Of course these are things that should and hopefully will be flushed out better, but at the moment is not so significant and doesn't severely hamper gameplay.  

Graphics are beautiful, as well as in game sound.  It truly well builds the environment of war, making you feel as though you really are a poor conscript forced to storm a trench line, or cross a muddy field all while being shelled by mortar or artillery.  

I feel like the strength of this game's sensory and direct experience is also it's fault, as it puts a lot of emphasis on the experience of war at the cost of the freedom of teamwork and coordination.  Another point of this is the spawning system which operates by 30 second spawntime waves.  There is no individual spawn time.  You either catch the 30 second countdown, or wait till the next 30 second count down.  If players were to spawn based on a time of their individual death, it would force squads to actually rally and move together as sticking as a force would be better than trickling in one by one, as is in post scriptum/squad.  Instead this spawn system further encourages the piling up behaviour.  Sure there is some flanking and tactics based on where the group goes after they spawn and where they place their rally point, but generally it's then 'just keep running to the objective to hold the line'.  

In conclusion, marvellous war experience.  Some people hate the clunkiness, I prefer it.  It's gritty and tough, and makes you struggle to land your shots in the heat of battle, making it more satisfying when you manage to handle yourself in a confrontation and take down a couple of guys.  Shooting revolvers among other guns feels more like the Godfather or Peaky Blinders rather than any Hollywood movie nowadays.  Teamwork is lacking and less crucial than ps/squad.  It's more focused on the fighting than the coordination with the objectives now.  Graphics are good, optimisation is good with few and small hiccups.  Sound is very good, music is however forgettable.  Oh and buy on discount.  Definitely not something for full price of yet unless you are here to support the devs.  Tanks are in the works for the game so that's gonna be interesting.  I feel rifles need a bit more polishing to make them feel more precisely realistic.  In general, real good ww1 experience, but don't expect great teamwork depth as you would post scriptum or squad."
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"i love hell let loos an believed this would be similar in sorts but only to find that when i got on the game was dead, there are forms saying that on Wednesdays the community put on a big game but frankly i don't want a game that i can only play one day a week and im not even guaranteed ill even get in the game. big shame this game looked so F good to"
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"pros 
:very immersive game play
:in depth gun play
:faster paced then other games in the genre like squad PS HLL
:many content up dates to come soon 
:up dates come fairly fast
:the melee combat

Cons
:many bugs and glitches 
:crashes 
:only two game modes 
:lack of active servers (this may change when the game gets fully released) 
:much more casual then other games in the genre I.E much more stamina, infinite bandages, much faster spawning and no tickets"
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,Its 11pm on a Saturday night and I see a total of 6 people online including myself. This game is great when it comes to gameplay (uses the same engine as squad but much added) provided there are players. I am concerned about the longevity of this $40 CAD game. Its getting constant updates and when playing in servers it feels great. However at this time I do not recommend this game.
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"after free weekend, no players and hardly any servers. DO NOT RECOMMEND. was a fun game when it was played"
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"Need more time on development- 

fix shotgun hit registration
fix stamina for melee
fix spawn barriers - we get killed on our main spawn even before the game started


I loved squad but this game needs more time on development,"
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,Was looking forward to playing it but i keep logging in and theres literally 1 server with 5 ppl in it ... how am i supposed to play a game like this with 5 people ... looks amazing .. but cant enjoy it
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"The game is so much fun, but not enough players."
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"dead game
"
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,dont waste cash on a dead game
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"""beyond the dead servers"" dont bother, good game, cant play it."
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"As of now, Beyond the wire has a seriously lack of players. The game and gameplay is really good but the devs have not put enough work in advertisement. The game is only enjoyable at times were there are enough players to fill a couple of servers (Which is almost never the case) There are many gamers out there who would have enjoyed this game but dont know it even exist. It is so bad that at times there are just around a hundred people online at a time. I really enjoy the game when there are full servers, and i believe it has potential to be a great game. There are just not enough players. Its not really an imersive expirience when there is a bayonet charge with only 10 people rushing and 10 people defendng."
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"There isnt a server in the US running with over 4 people on it at the moment. The only populated server is in the EU. Its an extremely good game, but there is next to nobody playing it."
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,awesome game!  just needs a bigger player base
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"Really fun if you care stand the game being in extremely early development.  Has a great feel to it like RS2 Vietnam, and has amazing potential imo."
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,Impressed by the fantastic pace of combat; on par with Red Orchestra in its confluence of teamwork and constant effort needed to move the front lines. Already great and with potential to get better. With this framework I would be very happy to see the game follow Red Orchestra's commitment to Social Realist themes about WW1 supported by the tone of gameplay and mis en scene- that would shift this from being an already quite good game to something truly fantastic.
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,gud game but theres barely any active servers
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"This game is very immersive. If you like realist first person shooter games, this is the game for you. The weapons make pvp challenging, and all the more fun. 5/5"
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"very good, the only drawback is a relatively low playerbase"
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,"I had to ask for a refund, because there was no one playing it."
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,its insanely fun but it has an extremely low player count to the point i can only play once every few days on a server that has more than 10 players. also the ping has never dipped below 90 and is 95% of the time over 110. it wasn't really worth 30 bucks considering how often i can play. i bought it roughly 2 months ago and only have 37 hours of play time because of how rare it is to find a server with a tolerable amount of people.
Beyond The Wire,Massively%20Multiplayer,1058650,I think this game is awesome but i cant recommend it because the only time ive seen 1 full lobby was free weekend. this games doesn't get past 15 players max and its design for 100 people either they make the game cheaper or i cant imagine those 15 players lasting forever.
iRacing,Racing,266410,thank you mr racing i am now 900 trillion dollars in debt
iRacing,Racing,266410,"The monthly subscription fee is just too high for me to continue with it. 

Had some very good races and the community generally well behaved (get the odd idiot) but come on .. this monthly fee?"
iRacing,Racing,266410,"It is so fucking expensive,

80€ for the game

10€ each month

and 12€ for every Car and 15€ for every track

are you guys crazy? I cant belive i wasted so much money on this shit"
iRacing,Racing,266410,"The closest thing to being a real life race car driver, but without the insane costs (debatable) and risk of death.
Steam doesn't accurately record playtime... only for a few seconds after you launch it.  So, hours of that... you get the idea.  Absolutely need a wheel for this game, do not even try with a controller; you will laugh at yourself as the game laughs at you.

Just dont crash in your first race and FINISH, even if it's 10th, you will still get a safety rating increase and on your way out of rookies! (where the fun really begins)

10/10 would qualify in 12th to avoid first corner pileup again."
iRacing,Racing,266410,"(NOTE: I have way more than 20 minutes played, i only just started playing on steam) 
The best competitive sim racing experience you can have. Definitely have to pay to play, however. Not only is the subscription not cheap but cars and tracks are very expensive at around $15 a pop. This isn't a huge drawback though because you should just pick a series or two you like and run them. It's not necessary to spend loads of money on everything in the game to have a great time, unless you just want to."
iRacing,Racing,266410,"expensive but built that way to try and detour bad racers or people wrecking you, very good sim one of the best ive played"
iRacing,Racing,266410,"The readily available races against other people and the variety of cars and tracks to race, makes this game a must."

Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"U want a honest review?

First let me start by saying i have played this sim/racing game on another account that i completely forgot about that has 1500hrs on it easily, sooo yea i have 4000hrs in this and yes i have played this since it first came out(i have time to kill im retired basically).

Lets talk about stock AC (Assetto Corsa) by today's standards, mind you this sim is almost 8yrs old 
 
8/10
-Plenty of cars and tracks to choose from so u can have fun at a nice price, goes on sell quite often (after you have setup your wheel and pedals properly or with controller or keyboard, AND get your FOV dialed in) 

-U can get good/great fps even on a somewhat dated pc until u decide to do something crazy like race on the Nordschleife with every ai u can possibly fit or try VR

-Graphics, well its age shows right there :whooze: 

-Physics, does just fine though some cars do feel extremely glued to the road or have broken aerodynamics or just drive like bricks ( so if u think ur going to just get in a Mclaren P1 and do some drifts like u seen on a few yt videos... well best of luck), but hey nothing is perfect especially something this old still does better than games like gts or pc2-3 imo
 
Now for the modded version of AC
 
MY GOD the modded community has done a number on this sim and for the better  

 10/10 ( if i get the right content )
-Between SOL(weather update), CSP (Custom Shaders Patch), CM (Content Manger), PPF (PostProcessingFilters) this sim looks like it belongs in a game trailer from this year, dont believe me? Just go inside the Screenshot channels of a DECENT AC discord server and look.

-There (i cant express this enough) are good and great mods and then there are bad and terrible mods be it tracks or cars etc, im not going to get into detail about because it would take forever to explain but to put it as short as possible there are some mods that look and drive worse than stock AC and there are mods that are just so much fun and everything feels natural u can get lost in this sim for hrs and hrs, just ask around in a DECENT AC discord server or go to RaceDepartment 

Yes i would recommend this sim to anyone that has a love/ passion for cars but try not get too involved with the some of community, odds are you'll end up in argument with kids or adults who should honestly get off and get a job."
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"bro,, vrum vrum u feel me? is nice af tbh"
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"Without proper gear, not worth it. Oh and didn't recognize two of my controller.(both xbox360, one cable other wireles)"
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,Best sim racing game right now
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"Comunity of this game is something, realy something! 

If someone nees help with start in game just notice"
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,Very nice
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,Turns out i cant drive for shit
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"The world isn't ready for the tyre physics. More playable on a keyboard than other driving simulators. A steering wheel & pedals makes it easier, and quality force-feedback makes it easier still.

You can't drive at full speed, tap brake, and steer like NFS. The game is about finding braking points, turn in point, smoothly braking & accelerating. Trail-braking works. It's difficult to find the braking & turn-in points with a small screen/non-VR, and it's difficult to know when the car is understeering without force-feedback. So it's difficult to go fast.

Nearly every sports car & track has been modded for the game to a high standard."
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"Seems like they spent all the time on the cars themselves, and no time anywhere else. Races feel bland and bare-bones, setting one up feels like a chore and it, just doesn't feel fun. Like at all."
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"Cruising down on the Wangan street with JDM cars for fun with the bois certainly made Assetto Corsa one of the greatest and enjoyable game with its wide mods support.

Assetto Corsa has an active modding community that still provides players with fresh content regularly. As with any mods, some are amazing whilst others are of questionable quality, but one thing’s for sure, you aren’t going to run out of new things to try any time soon. One mod I particularly enjoy adds an excellent recreation of the Wangan - C1 Street racing with JDM cars by Shutoko Revival Project 2.0, adding in the entire field of cars and their various liveries. It’s just one example of the fantastic work the Assetto Corsa community has produced.

These mods can add your favourite cars to the game or even just throw a new livery onto an existing favourite of yours. And with the game offering good support for mods, both for creators and players, you don’t need to worry about modding being too difficult to be accessible. The majority of mods are as simple as downloading the content then dragging and dropping the files into your game folder, meaning you can find a mod on a site like RaceDepartment and in a matter of minutes, be flying around the track in your new car.

So now you’ve heard me sing the game’s praises, I think it’s pretty obvious that I think Assetto Corsa is worth picking up in 2021. The driving experience it provides and the wealth of content available from the modding community give you an endlessly enjoyable game that you can sink hours into. And with Assetto Corsa Competizione focusing solely on GT racing rather than offering the variety of the original, much of what Assetto Corsa has to offer can’t be found in the newer release.


So whilst the Ultimate Edition may feel a tad pricey for a six-year-old game, it’s well worth picking up if sim-racing is something you enjoy or want to get into. Not to mention the fact that it goes on sale in nearly every Steam sale there is for more than half price. So with the Steam Summer Sale coming up this June you won’t even have to wait that long to grab it for a good price."
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"It's a fantastic game, with a large modding community ready to help you with what isn't satisfying you in the base game.

Shall you decide to buy it, watch this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXAdYoCuk0), it will teach you everything you need to know about downloading and applying mods."

A 200$ steering wheel isn't really 'necessary' exactly for better experience, you could just use your mouse to steer.
But if you have one, you're on point.
There isn't anything to 'progress' though, I play this game whenever i feel like to, to listen to the car sounds, enjoying the graphics, and essentially, the car, you know.
This game is already good for it's stock, but DLCs and MODs REALLY enhance its experience. Speaking of MODs, you should check out the MOD, Content Manager if you own this game.

Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,bast drift game
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"Assetto Corsa is one of the best sim racing games on the market without a doubt. The force feedback model is very detailed and it allows you to feel exactly what the car wants to do. The handling of the cars feel amazing and you can really feel like you are on the edge of what the tyres can do. Whether you enjoy to drift, circuit race, time attack, or even drag race, this game has a mode for you. The game comes with a good amount of content out of the box and even more with the DLC addons which frequently go on sale. But what this game is known most for is its modding capabilities. There is a plethora of mods that you can get for this game to increase your enjoyment tenfold. The games graphics do look slightly outdated compared to modern titles, but they are not bad and can even be enhanced with graphics mods. The only other complaint I have is that some cars that use slick tyres feel as if they have an excess of turn-in grip, but this is easily overlooked due to everything else in the game being spot on. All-in-all, this game is a must have in any sim-racers library and is enjoyable no matter what motorsport discipline you are interested in."

Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"I can literally spend hours and hours lapping one car (lotus 49) on one track (Spa) in this game and be absolutely happy. It feels so great. There are loads more fantastic cars and laser scanned tracks of course, but with this big smile I'm wearing, I may never find out!
Combine this with a direct drive wheel (accuforce) and a motion sim rig (simxperience), and virtual reality (pimax) : and the experience is elevated to another level entirely! This is the software you need. What are you waiting for?"

Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"very hesitant yes.  the racing mechanics are really good and pretty realistic but the UI is awful, just awful."
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,I will become pro drifter one day
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"This is not a ""bad"" game. If you are a completionist or a tinkerer or own your own driving rig, this review doesn't really apply to you and you should ignore it when deciding whether this game is for you (it may very well be). However, I just want to race cars in VR, so having oversensitive driving controls, several menus of setup before I get to the drivers seat of a fairly limited selection of non-DLC cars and boring pretty flat scenery once I actually get to the track were not particularly inspiring to me and there are frankly much better options available by now for most casual or semi-casual racing sim players (and probably better options for the not so casual players too). Since this is now a pretty uninspired entry in an over-full genre, I unfortunately can't recommend it."
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"I dunno, it's suppoused to be a sim? but the tires scream when im taking a curve at 60 km/h??? what? So i bought this because it was 90% of and had my car in it. (Mazda mx5) and i really do not get it because the handling is so fucking bad in this game???? do not take this ''sim'' for anything close to the real deal, because it really is not. I mean a real Mz5 feels like a streetlegal-go kart and feels like your on a railway that good is the handeling in curves. and the Pow view is very much not what it is in the real-deal either. 

don't buy this just because your car is featured in it, it most likely wont be close to what it is in real life anyway...."
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"fix the controller op pls, my ds 4 usually works with other games"
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,It's very nice.
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"If you're hoping to play this with a controller, be warned that you cannot remap any of the keys except the up-shift and down-shift. You are stuck with the joystick to steer and the right and left triggers for your accelerator and brake, which felt awful. I cannot believe that a game that has been out as long as this one does allow you remap the controls to whatever you are comfortable with. It would be one thing if this was an early access title that had just launched, and the devs hadn't gotten to that yet but this game has been out for years and looking it up, this has been an ongoing complaint about this game that whole time, and yet they still haven't done anything about it. 

I never even thought to look something like this up before purchasing the game because I never would have expected it to be an issue. It's true that if you want the ""real racing experience"", you should buy a sim wheel, shifter, pedals and all of that stuff but not all of us can afford to do that or even want to do it. Some of us were just happy playing our racing games with controllers, so with that unfortunate revelation. I hit refund on this game. It may be possible to force-remap the game somehow looking at the cfg files but I am just not going to fight with it because I shouldn't have to in the first place.

The Gran Turismo games have always been the gold standard when it comes to racing games, and while there too, you can easily opt for a steering wheel, shifter and pedals and have a really solid experience, the games have always offered full controller support which worked beautifully too. It's crazy that Assetto Corsa doesn't offer this same basic functionality."

Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"This games need a steering wheel set up, I don't even have it. Just want to experience on keyboard and its so hard. Its not worth it at all when you don't have a set up or controller"
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"Very versatile simulator, you can do pretty much anything race related in Assetto Corsa, Saying that it is expansive is an understatement. Has very accurate physics and wear (tyres, fuel consumption, ect). The only thing that I wish was a little better would probably be the damage model. Its a little lack luster and lacks any type of deforming but wheels can deform some what (bending the wrong way, ect). But I personally think that doesn't really effect the game that much since the mechanical damage is pretty spot on. You can break pretty much every part of you car and if you do damage a part in some way, you car would function exactly as if you were to damage that part in real life. Something I would really like to see for Assetto Corsa is some sort of workshop integration. It would make getting mods (which are pretty much required if you want to get the most out of the game possible) a whole lot easier. There is a lot of really sketchy websites that exist for Assetto Corsa mods, so its best to stick to the ones that have been trusted for years. (Assettocorsa.club is probably one of the best ones out there today, Same goes for racedepartment.). 

In conclusion, Assetto Corsa can be a fantastic sim if you put work into making fantastic. Vanilla I think that it lacks in some departments (graphics, car selection, tracks). But they can all be adjusted, Sol is probably the best for making the weather look the best, CSP (custom shaders patch) makes the game look a lot more alive, and the amount of tracks that you can find online is borderline overwhelming, there is literally thousands of them.

9.8 Great simulator and can suit lots of peoples needs, just needs a bit of setting up before you get going.

The engine sounds on some cars could be better and at times the wheels keep spinning even when something is blocking it/inside of it, would be nice if the bumpers, tires and other things damage the cars when they come off and hit the car/other cars. Also if props around the map would break/get scratched and more then it might just be perfect. Sometimes the cars feel like they are made of plastic also (they way they bend/break). The car's color should get scratched off. Maybe an official multiplayer mode instead of using beammp. i dont know why i'm writing it, noone will probably read it fully lol"

All the mods Ive tried worked really well, they download quick, and their are hundreds of them; every time i go looking for mods, i find new ones, wheather thats through the official mod browser or a 3rd party website.


I feel this game is suitable for everyone, weather you want to race, climb hills and mountains, go fast, go off-road, do challenges cusomise cars and see how good they can look, or just straight up explore the scenery and graphics of the hundreds of maps you can play.

I totally agree on what PervasivePeach ⁧⁧♡ says here, on 1 track i find winning the race with 20 seconds between me and the 2nd guy and the other race i find myself on the 16th place

another thing i don't like is that when another driver drives into me i sometimes get a penalty even though it was not my fault

F1® 2020,Sports,1080110,Great f1 game
F1® 2020,Sports,1080110,v fun but i hate the vietnam track and hamilton wont stop hitting me and im sad
F1® 2020,Sports,1080110,I hate Hamilton
F1® 2020,Sports,1080110,If you like Mercedes you will love this game.
F1® 2020,Sports,1080110,Oh this shiiiiiizzz is good!
F1® 2020,Sports,1080110,Incredibly fun. The multiplayer aspect is so thrilling.
F1® 2020,Sports,1080110,"F1 2020, more than any of its predecessors, is not just for die-hard Formula One fans. It is, quite simply, the best racing game currently on sale; it just happens to boast the official license for the pinnacle of motorsport. Codemasters, once again, has set the bar intimidatingly high for its rival developers.
I didn't find any bug so far. So, Great experience so far."
F1® 2020,Sports,1080110,"Except for the spitscreen mode, never really noticed any issues with the game. The interviews after quali and the race in career mode is a bit annoying but that is just personal preference. 
The game itself looks incredible and also has a HDR mode which works well. 
Sucks that you cant use the game with any form of Anti Aliasing and codemasters themselves have asked me to remove any sort of AA enabled. 
8/10 nice one CM."
F1® 2020,Sports,1080110,"I used to buy F1 games practically annually in the mid V8 to early hybrid V6 days. The sound was phenomenal, but the games felt so-so. To be honest, driving the same car over and over again was never my schtick - but F1 2020 is probably the first F1 game I truly enjoyed in years. The driving? Brilliant. Classic cars? Lovely. driving in F2 before going to F1? I'm not a fan of driving the F2 cars, but it's a great addition anyway. Managing your own team? Excellent. That's so far my favourite thing - though, being a newcomer who missed the previous ""Podium Passes"", the selection of available liveries are appalling (we'll get back to that), and every driver having the same 5 or so poses becomes a bit uncanny, and there's literally only one podium animation. But, oh well - at least the racing's good, and it's set in a utopian world where - well, first of all, clearly, there's no pandemic and Grosjean is all fine - and if I'm not there to intervene, Bottas or Verstappen ends up in P1; Hamilton consistently between 3-6; Vettel-LeClerc between 5-7.  Seriously, what the hell, Bottas is a monster in this game.

Anyway, while the handling is beautiful, I think the controller settings could do with a little tweaking, because no matter what I do, it can feel incredibly loose near the centre - not ideal where micro-corrections needs to be done.

I'd love to be able to do more customisation to the chassis - change aero shapes, wheels, and all - but this is a good step. Hopefully.... Considering the sharp turn of publisher for this year's release. What I fear is that this might be the last prominent change we'll see in several years, as it seems to be the trend with annual, particularly sport titles. [b]Even more particularly[/b] from [b][i]that[/i][/b] publisher.

Some things I didn't like - the livery system. Where games like GT, Forza, and NFS give player full artistic freedom, we're stuck with paid visuals and fake sponsors here. Pricing isn't egregious compared to some other franchise I've played, but that's not the point. And again, considering the next publisher and their prior drama with paid contents - frankly it doesn't fill me with confidence.

Something a bit more personal, since I'm a bit of an idiot, and I feel like I'm managing the team alone - a friendly team reminder to switch from practice powertrain to quali/race powertrain would be great. I grenaded 2 of my Renault engines because of that, and I do not wish the same for the Mercedes engine I have now. Also I'm stuck in the Monaco GP because I can't drive the 2020 cars there. Bloody hell, they're huge - had a much nicer time driving the skittish classic V10 cars there.

But anyway, got it for cheap (thanks, regional pricing + sale) - but even at full price, it wasn't egregiously expensive. Great game, pick it up if you want some good track racing game that's playable with a controller."
F1® 2020,Sports,1080110,after playing this game i can be sexualized as a world class racist
F1® 2020,Sports,1080110,please dont buy! Servers are so Dead on EU. People drive like its fucking Gta. Cant reccomend. I cant even get a server on ranked without having to wait for a whole race to end.
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"Three steps to slowly but surely climbing up the racing leaderboards in the Crew 2:
1. Grind for better parts (Loot)
2. Grind money (to re-roll affixes)
3. Grind for followers (maximal perks)

The Crew 2 is a racing RPG at its best!"
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"The Crew 2 is big, confident, and stuffed with arcade racing action – land, sea, and air. There’s undoubtedly something still charming about a racing game that lets us drive an F1 car across the Golden Gate bridge, fly a Spitfire through the Grand Canyon, and crash a monster truck through Central Park, but its uneven presentation, lack of events that use its best features, and absent PvP is a bummer.

"
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"This game works well with controller and keyboard. However, if you were planning to use a steering wheel. forget it. The default keybinds for wheel are awful and whenever you try to change them the game crashes. I have seen multiple people with this issue and still haven'
t found a solution."
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,Is a good game but its hard to buy cars.
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,insane map
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"What is this game like? A game with a huge world, with an abundant number of vehicles, you can explore not only land, but also air and water. The actions of the game take place in the United States of America, during the game you will have where to turn around, drift, drag, ring races, as well as races all over the map, there will be no borders in front of you. ... You can buy a car of any level, the first good car will not be long in coming. Farming money in the game happens pretty quickly, but it's no less interesting from it. The map shows major cities in the States, as well as their attractions. Simply stunning graphics, effects of water, mud, rain, sun, clouds. Also, during the game you will visit the winter season, the physics of the car will change quite noticeably, which cannot but rejoice. But there are also disadvantages, your car in the game is not titanium, a small tree, like in Forza, will not be able to knock down, when it collides with a stone, it will most likely not stop it, but throw it up. In this game, cars are more like jumpers. I think we will stop at this and will not continue talking about the shortcomings of this game, but talk about the interface and additional functions.

The game has a very simple and beautiful interface, the eye rejoices looking at the picture in the hall. Also, the game is equipped with a photo function, at any moment of movement you can stop the moment and become a real photographer. You will be able to publish your work on the official website of the game.

The game also has character customization, leveling up skills, making a model out of furniture to make everyone envy you.

In conclusion, I want to say that it is a very rich game, its advantages overlap all the disadvantages, many updates have been made to the game, as well as a battle pass, if you are not sure about buying the game, then look at its reviews on the Internet. Thanks for attention !"
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,grindy car game its fun
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,The game looks good overall however making money is sorta difficult. Not to mention that the driving physics are horrible.
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"I personally would just go buy Forza Horizon 4, it's also on Steam and I enjoy that game more. If you want this game, please wait for a sale."
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,yep yep insane co-op game this game is good I give it a 7/10
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,it's a good game but I can't even play it anymore. it keeps disconnecting me 1 minute in and that's frustrating. what a disappointment
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"Micro-transactions out the ass, not really any single-player flexibility in terms of how you want to play the game beyond ""I will ignore the planes because the control scheme is fucking dumb"". Maybe it's my fault but I just assumed a racing game was supposed to be fun. Didn't want a pseudo-multiplayer racing game, but that's what this is. Oh well."
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"This is one of the best open-world racing games, with the likes of the Forza Horizon franchise, the large map makes the possibilities of fun challenges almost endless. This is one of the best multiplayer racing games to do long races and cruises. Although, the multiplayer lobbies (crew) only allow 4 people, a minor inconvenience but not game-changing."
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,Good Game !
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,this game is a fukin g joke a total waste of time not worth of money
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"Go play Forza Horizon 4, this is nfs payback with extra steps"
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,the game keeps crashing. I could not finish my races because of it. This issue has wasted my time of farming the bucks.
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"I'm only 2 hours in and it feels like I've experienced all the interesting aspects of the game already. Worth $5 sure. Anything more than that, probably not.

Pros:
- your airplane can transform into a car and fall out of the sky
- they got rid of a lot of the story from the first Crew game and get you into the action arguably quicker
- gameplay is smoother than the original (fewer buggy connection issues)

Cons:
- there are still annoying cut scenes and a half baked story
- the world is not as memorable or interesting as the first game 
- the terrain and weather was a lot more interesting in the original
- there's not much to do outside of the key spots spread out over the map
- they got rid of the whole cops chasing you concept when you cause destruction (although it is less annoying when you're trying to do something)
- all of the cars feel the same (driving off road with a Miata feels nearly the same as an offroad dune buggy)
- exploration is boring compared to similar games

Recommend playing the original instead. If you don't like story, try Forza Horizon or Burnout Paradise. All of them are much more enjoyable and interesting to just drive around in the world, in addition to being more fun when you do get into the action."
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"game doesnt live up the hype.Ive played the game after reviewing so i can confidently say that the game has the alt tab bug,the keyboard controller switch bug and the random game crash bug.Graphic and Grindwise game looks good.Dont buy  the game unless it goes for like 6 bucks at max."
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"Ok. I had a lot of fun cruising alone over the wide roads of the map. I also like the design and the sound of the vehicles some times. Game is not too buggy and you can do some races even with friends together.

But every single event is only there to generate even more revenue for the producers. The worst thing is that it's only about milking the remaining players dry, because you still have to pay for the new events to be able to collect the rewards at all. In addition, it is also very expensive. Even worse is once you have bought the ""access"", you have to fulfill certain orders so that you can get the rewards at all and the orders are boring to compete and only serve the players to stay in the game. It takes hoursssss to fullfill the orders. I just played 1hr (6 races) and I didn't get any reward through the leveling system from the event. The event also ends in like 39 days. I assume that I'm gonna lose the ability to get the rewards.
 
But look at that, you can also buy the orders with real money so you can get the rewards. Very original Ubis... Well done, I'm proud. Just like any other event which you released so far. These aren't rewards anymore, they're crappy expensive skins."
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"nice!
"
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,it's a fun game and bike handling is the best :)
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"worst racing game i have ever played 
i cant fly plane without controller and fps locked at 60 
default 30 
this id for console not for PC 
and the graphics feels old too"
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"Back in its early days, The Crew 2 was definitely worth buying. It had plenty of content across several different disciplines. As of recently, however, here is why I cannot recommend this to anyone:

1: With the advent of Motorpass, the developers chose to kill off the contracts. This makes it impossible for anyone to gain credits-only content, so it's a huge slap in the face to players like me that played the game on a regular basis. As others have already said, most content is now hidden behind a massive paywall. Because Ubisoft isn't making enough money...
2: Live summits have become infested with cheaters and tryhards. There is no point trying to complete these by fair and clean racing when the top 3000 abuse back-on-track and have memorised evey single possible shortcut on every single race.
3: Large amounts of content have been woefully under-developed. Jetsprint, hovercraft, aerobatics and motocross are hardly ever used, to name a few desciplines that have been completely forgotten about, in favour of pure hypercars.
4: Ubisoft isn't very good at being hard on cheaters, and that is no clearer than on these race leaderboards. Most race records involve an average top speed that is AT LEAST 30% faster than the absolute maximum of any car in the game. And then you have those that can abuse fast-travel to complete races instantly. And their approach isn't to ban such cheaters, but just to remove their times from the leaderboard. What kind of message do they think that sends...

Just get Forza. I have no other words to describe the contempt that I have for Ubisoft for utterly ruining this game that I loved for so long."
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,Better play it with your friends
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,">Huge open world, with landmarks and vegetation

>Loads of different vehicles including planes, superbikes, performance trucks, baja truck(s?), formula 1 cars, hot rods, monster trucks. Kinda cool.

>Live summits are fun, and simply participating will get you tons of followers and other rewards

>There are a couple of real tracks in the game, but some of the them are sketchy as fuck

>Vehicle customization is OK at best - Visual customization is nowhere close to Heat though, And, performance adjustments, tuning and other upgrades - certainly no where close to FH4.

>Community vinyl for all vehicles

>Progression system is based off of ""loot"" you get from winning races, something I really didn't like

>Grindy as hell and riddled with microtransactions

>??? Handling

>Really weird AI Drivers (Very inconsistent, sometimes they spin out, other times they have insane grip and they're rubberbandy as hell (they might randomly catch up to you in like 3 seconds, even if you're like 10 kms ahead of them. But most of the time, you can just ignore them and pass them all at race start).

>Keep in mind, the game came out in 2018, and it still lacks a lot of Quality of life improvements (Unnecessary animations, no way to change your avatar, buggy as fuck, 60 fps framerate cap, Mobile game tier world detail and progression system)

>Has something like Forzavista but its very lacking

>Bikes are cool, and that's the only reason I bought the game, but the inputs on some bikes feel very laggy and sometimes they feel very unresponsive, especially on motocross bikes
(you can take your op bikes to street races where most of the ai drive cars and basically cut every single corner without any penalty)

>You need to grind to icon level to actually use the more relevant features of the game (aero adjustments, icon points investment - which give you multipliers for your various stats and skills).

>Annoying characters and narration,with really weird, cheesy dialogues - so turn down the voices volume when you play

>>Reccomended cus itl'l teach you to never buy trash from ubisoft"
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"Literally THE WORST wheel support game i have ever tried in my life. 
Also had a problem with it crashing for straight 2 days and only worked after resetting my windows.
What a basic ubisoft game...."
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,It's a good game for racing game lovers. Can play multiplier with friends. You'll enjoy your time.
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,sometimes crashes on teleporting to another city and the controls for the planes really suck
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,much better than the first iteration of the crew. But not worth the full price. Would recommend when the game goes on sale.
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"- NEVER have i ever written a review for a steam game. and this game is so GARBAGE, that i literally cannot help myself. the mechanics for everything except for street racing are so bad its almost a comedy game. flying is harder then the entire dark souls campaign with one arm behind your back. this game does have amazing customization and i love the non-realistic tires and effects, no sarcasm i actually do. BUT obtaining any of them at all is impossible without in game purchases or the ability to sit and play this paint dry, zero story driven, joke of a game non-stop for at least 100 hours to possibly get good at ONE SINGLE flight challenge. i honestly wanna give kudos to those that are so far and so high level cause quite frankly i feel like someone has a gun to your head telling you to play this. i wish i was never even introduced to this game. -8000/10 developers need help actually making mechanics for a racing game."

Descenders,Sports,681280,"MTB and DNB what more could you want. This game is great fun, the game-play is good and the controls are smooth, there are plenty of levels to roll through, some harder than others but all fun, minus the forest, I hated that. The customisation is good, you can choose jerseys, bikes etc but they need unlocking as you progress and they do so randomly , a shop system would be nice to have. The soundtrack is fantastic and fits the game-play perfectly, I also recommend playing with a controller. Great game."

Descenders,Sports,681280,catJAM
Descenders,Sports,681280,"i like this game , i enjoy this game,I will continue to play this game, but there's so many niggling issues stopping me from recommending it.
the rng in the level creation has given me an unwinnable scenario on a boss jump where it was simply impossible to get enough speed to clear this has happened multiple times. 
jumps feel like they're made of ice for some reason and love to shoot you off to side so minor corrections are very difficult to make last second.
 Pumping is such an integral skill to have and use in this game yet its rarely mentioned and there's almost no consistent way to practice this skill without mods, also its quite difficult to determine whether or not your pumping correctly since the game gives no indication besides a speed increase ( an audio que could somewhat fix this) and there's no real tutorial on doing it from what i have seen.
"
Descenders,Sports,681280,fun times m8
Descenders,Sports,681280, I like this game a lot. The graphics are really good and  its very realistic
Descenders,Sports,681280,"Pros: 
The custom parks are cool, although there are only a couple. 
The bikes are cool.

Cons:

The most generic, lifeless, uninspired, run of the mill soundtrack I have heard, it sounds like copyright free EDM / drum and bass that was all over 2012 youtube. 

The animations are stiff and super clunky.

You get one item at the end of a run, there are tons of cosmetics to unlock (Mainly just some clothes piece with a different color slapped on it. 

What procedural generation? The tracks feel the same EVERY SINGLE TIME. They all feel horrible, its super glitchy and awkward. You have to go fast to make a jump, but if you go too fast and a pebble is in the same galaxy as you, you are going to fall off. 

It feels like complete luck when you do good. I can't explain it, but it is not rewarding at all, and I avoid career mode as much as possible, but that is the only way to unlock cosmetics.

No communication. No voice chat, no text chat, no emotes, voice lines, nothing. 

Just buy steep or Session. This game is ass. 

TLDR: It sucks."
Descenders,Sports,681280,"fun game just to chill and do tricks, definitely a learning curve, but very satisfying once you are skilled"
Descenders,Sports,681280,really good i love the graphics love it
Descenders,Sports,681280,Good game best with friends - online work again
Descenders,Sports,681280,"[h1]Descenders tries to be many things but becomes nothing as a result[/h1]
It is a game simple in premise and execution, it is easy to pick up and get going but there is a lot to master as well and a high skill ceiling. However, due to lack of focus the game becomes a conflicted mess once you think about it.

[h2]Pros:[/h2]
[List]
[*][b]Excellent controls - [/b]Simple and effective, they are not too tight and not too loose. Steering is challenging at high speeds but not impossible.
[*][b]Sense of speed - [/b]I cannot remember any other game with such a great sense of speed. You accelerate quickly and moving fast is exhilarating. And when you are able to thread the needle it is so satisfying.
[*][b]Procedural generation - [/b]Basically an infinite amount of tracks. There is also a lot of variety because of it and the fact that there are 8 distinct biomes with different hazards and features.
[/List]

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
[List]
[*][b]It does not know what it wants from you - [/b]You start playing and naturally you follow the track downhill. Going as fast as possible towards the finish line is very fun. But soon you realize that you can go off track and ignore the preset track, and then you realize that there is no good incentive to go fast and that the best way to reach the goal reliably is to crawl down at a snail's pace. All that matters is that you do not crash, nothing else is important. I made it to the end just by slowly rolling downhill and pressing the breaks constantly. I think the idea is that there are many intended ways of playing e.g. going fast, doing stunts, drifting or going off-road. And by making all of those options viable that failed to make it worthwhile adhering to either style.
[*][b]Roughlike structure - [/b]Each run you make it through one or more maps of connected nodes that represent a track. They have different stats and modifiers but since going slow is the way to go, nothing matters. What playing risky can give you are extra lives and crewmembers. I might suck, but going for extra lives is often more risky than just ignoring the challenge and descent safely. Losing a life trying to gain one is a zero sum game at best. Crewmembers give extremely niche or minor bonuses that do not impact gameplay in any meaningful way. 
[*][b]Overworld map - [/b]There is no incentive to not just take the shortest path towards the map exit making the majority of each overworld map superfluous. Playing more maps are just more opportunities to mess up and lose lives. And apparently if you play too many maps the sun sets and you have to ride in the dark, but this NEVER happened to me and I never saw any reason to play more tracks than absolutely necessary.

Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed Collection,Racing,212480,Highly recommend its simple fast paced and enjoyable. Zooming around the courses and perfectly executing risk boosts is so satisfying. This game when played right is very addictive. It is a must play for me 9/10.
Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed Collection,Racing,212480,"It was the last GOOD official Sonic game from Meta era!
I love how the game gave you many remixes to stages, but i miss being able to choose already existing songs for racing, which fitted really well!
Characters are much harder to unlock compared to previous Racing, but it does feel rewarding which i guess is fair, compared to being able to just buy one for making enough coins in 1st game.
The Transforming mechainic is very nice, makes the game stand out more, which is a great benefit.

The only downside, is that this game has Yogcast, but good news, its optional!

Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"This is one of the best games that I played in my entire life! Very picturesque, will not allow you to skip. As soon as I bought, I immediately began to play without a break, I want to spend more time driving a car on the roads of Great Britain. A huge variety of interesting races, competition with players online. The idea with a change in time of the year is simply ingenious, it looks great. I am glad that it is finally in Steam, since I do not have game consoles, and I only play a PC. Amazing game, I advise everyone without exception! :)"
Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's the most fun simcade driving game that I've had the pleasure of playing over the last few years, with hours upon hours of content, amazing graphics, and a really good car selection.

On the other, it's straight up THE most miserable multiplayer experience I have ever had with any game in my life.

Case 1: At it's worst, you can wait up to 15 MINUTES to get into one match, which takes lasts like 3 to 7 minutes at most. And THEN the game might just spontaneously crash whenever it feels like it. It seems to have gotten better since the Steam launch

Case 2:
I wasn't able to play with my friends (who bought the game on the Microsoft Store) for 3 WEEKS because the DNS servers were down, and any support tickets were marked as ""answered"" even if the issue wasn't solved. Instead of actually fixing the problem, which was clearly on their end, their support deflected instead and put the blame on the players themselves. Only when the servers went down completely and enough people started complaining about it (after 2 weeks since the issue has started) they actually started doing something, and even then, it took them one week straight to actually fix the problem.

Treat this review as a ""neutral rating"", since Steam doesn't have that option.
Ultimately, the core gameplay is so much fun that I would still highly recommend this game if you're into racing games. Just don't set your expectations for the multiplayer aspect of this game too high because you're just going to end up as disappointed as I am.

Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"forzaaa, yes the most fun game for me in terms of driving a car. far enough to play it on the ms store version, decided to buy it again on the steam version. there was a problem at the beginning where this version of steam didn't want to run. but good work for dev, now that obstacle is gone. next forza horizon 5?"

Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,Best racing game played so far!!!
Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,One of the best games ever played. However do not rush to buy it. See if it works on your pc or else you are you will be disheartened.
Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,it keeps crashing
Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,Very well optimized. Can run high settings at 70-80 fps with a 1050ti.
Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"Iam a huge fan of racing games since i was little and i played like fifty different race games and left fifteen years behind with them. and I know well what to look out for when reviewing a racing game.
Forza4 is a strong racing simulation which includes hundreds of different cars.
the variety of cars is really great and nice.
customizations, cars, open world, driving feel, auction house mechanics, places to buy, they are all awesome
One of the weak points of the game is ; it has no soul
Okay you are having good time amazing drivings, races but after some point you are asking yourself whats left to do
You can't physically see when you don't modify or drive the cars you own and thats killing the collector's spirit
you dont have a real garage where you can see al of the cars that you own. you have like a places where you can stay, modify, buy cars and bunch of stuff like that after buying them.
Not even gonna mention about the story because almost there is no story in this game its just good enough for a racing simulation.
A very fun and enjoyable car simulation, apart from a few bad aspects I mentioned.

BUT still after a few months of release they still haven't fix the goddamn STUTTERS my god, and its enough to get super annoying and quit playing especially when you are drifting it gets unbearable.

It's what any TDU fan wanted out of TDU2. If only the map was bigger. The game literally showers you with rewards to the point where you almost feel like it's not worth doing champoinships, because you can just win a new car by spinning a wheel every time you hit a new milestone on the progression map.

The port isn't flawless - it's prone to random crashes, it's especially infuriating during a race. Other than that, easy recomend."

Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,good morning
Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"First, to my Hardcore ""Simulation Only"" friends, I shook my head ""no"" too. Several Forza Horizons and Motorsports have came and went before I gave this a try simply because it is arcade.

This is ""anti-arcade"" mentality is something I used to suffer from. Forza 4 cured it. This is currently the best overall driving experience if you are being honest with yourself and those that you pretend care about your virtual driving.


If you want to have big fun in a vehicle... this and the term ""big fun"" are for you. If you have the perfect ""sim"" but wish it had more freedom.... get this. If your favorite ""simcade"" title does not have your favorite car... this probably does... go get it.

Catch me in traffic.

why are we drive and whats the meaning.  I remembered the old race games. I left only when I needed to eat or s..t. 

How can games come this point.

okay there is a lots of car in this game but this is meaningless. 

We spin the wheel then I have lamborghini.

Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"This is literally the best racing game so far. At the beginning I wasn't really fond of this kind of games, but I decided to give it a try. Best decision ever. I have been playing this game since I bought it, and after 120 hours of playing it, I still have championships to play, things to unlock, challenges to complete, places to discover, etc... And I haven't even started with the post-game content (DLCs)
This game has a lot of content and it's not repetitive at all, you can explore the maps by your own, you can compete in rally races, road races, etc... (there are a lot of different modes and you have to level up them all if you want to unlock the different achievements and awards), you can also play car minigames like capture the flag or zombie invasion, etc...
The map is amazing and has a lot of different places to explore, and each week the season changes (I mean summer, autumn, spring and winter). This allows you to replay the content and complete the events that you have already done in a new season. Each season changes  dramatically the gameplay and the events.
And the cutscenes and animations are ABSOLUTELY astonishing. Also during the gameplay you will have to find some spots, barn signs, etc... to complete certain challenges, which forces you to explore the maps. And you will also freak out with the music, now I only listen to Forza Horizon soundtrack on my daily basis xD
You have also a story mode that you can complete. Those are short races with a specific goal, ( the story mode has a lot of chapters like this)
And finally you can also play some online events, rankeds, etc... and I spent a lot of hours pushing myself to beat the players.
The game may seem a little bit overpriced, but it's definitely worth it. As I said at the beginning of this review, is the best racing game ever."
Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,One of the best car games
Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"[h1]5/10 - A fantastic game marred by horrific optimisation[/h1]

[i]Note: This review reflects opinions as of the FH4 Series 36 Update.[/i]
[i]This review may be edited if the development team handles concerns reflected in this review.[/i]

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[b]+Graphically Stunning[/b] (Lighting, visuals, etc. are stunning)
[b]+Repeatable Gameplay[/b] (Enough diversity in gameplay to keep player interested)
[b]+Seasons Mechanic[/b] (Creates a fun alternative every week with lakes freezing over, traction changes, etc.)
[b]+Solid Implementation of ""Gambling""[/b] (The wheelspin for rewards are provided at a reasonable quantity)
[b]+Beautiful and Diverse World[/b] (With glorious views of Edinburgh, the Lake District, etc., the views whilst driving are fantastic)

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[b]-Horrific Micro-Stutter[/b] (This game has a constant stutter throughout gameplay regardless of graphical settings)
[i](Specs are Ryzen 3900X, 32GB - 3600MHz, RTX 2070S - 1935MHz, 1TB MP600)[/i]
[i]Note: whilst not a solution, I did find that disabling g-sync reduced the stutter from full-on stuttering to a micro-stutter[/i]

[b]-Routine Crashing[/b] (Another complaint, this one being a serious one, is the periodic crashing that happens every 30-45 minutes, the game will visually freeze with audio continuing.)
[i]Note: this has caused me to continuously lose progress as I have noticed it routinely happens after race wins where the race will no longer be recognised as completed on restart.[/i]

[b]-Engine Audio[/b] (A minor complaint but worth mentioning, some higher RPM engines sound very poorly sampled almost describable as an auto-tune effect)
[b]-Race Wheel FFB[/b] (Force Feedback within this game feels very off, racing feels considerably harder with a wheel than a plain controller, so work needs to be put in here.)

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Gameplay-wise this game is fantastic. With a diverse map, more cars than you could feasibly ever drive, and enough races to keep you entertained for hundreds of hours, this game always manages to impress.
Nevertheless, where it all falls apart is the awful optimisation. My opinion on the game diminishes, knowing that I cannot get invested in the game with the lingering thought that at any moment, the game could crash.

Therefore, my final recommendation is that if you genuinely want to play this game, for the time being until further developments are made, pick up this game on the Windows Store instead of Steam, where stability is supposedly much better."
Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"best race game but steam version crash,stutter,lag"
Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"The best racing game of this Decade.

Cuz you know NFS Most Wanted 2005 is the top. 
However, on pure replayability, graphic fidelity, gameplay and stuff to do, this game takes the cake by a mile.
Like, the Weekly playlists concept is sooo good. It actively encourages the player with experiment with new cars.
Would definitely recommend this game to any fan of the racing genre.
My only con is that the game has stability issues in Steam and Playground games isnt bothered to fix it.
Game will crash/freeze randomly and even high end cards suffer from horrible stuttering. Its not unplayable, but its still dissapointing."

Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"The game is fantastic itself, but the steam version has crashing and slow downs issues. The microsoft store version doesn't."
Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"I adore this game.

It’s a really good one. The amount of content that the game amasses is just unreal, you’ll never run out of cars to try out, seasons are ever changing, and if you’re ever tired of roaming around Britain, there’s Fortune Island and the Lego City thingy.

But seriously, even in 2021, if you’ve never tried any Horizon games, I highly recommend this game. The amount of content is magical - but it doesn’t come with it’s backdraws.

I’ll need to get this one out, the gameplay is kinda bland. Yes it’s fun, but for almost the entirety of the game, you’re gonna be doing the same thing over and over again until you get the end, just with different cars and scenarios. The difficulty spike is also nonexistent. If you just wanna get to the end of the game, you just need to put some time in, you’ll eventually finish the main career of the game. The real challenge only comes when you wanna own absolutely everything and be an absolute completionist.

And with that being said, being a completionist myself, this is a really fun game. There’s a lot to see down at Britain, and even more so in the expansions, the map is fun and honestly, put on some music and just drive around. In this tough times, it’s really nice to be in a virtual world and drive around in a sports car down winding British backroads, because then again, it’s an easy game - no need to stress over money and honestly just play at your own pace and how you like it.

It’s a nice game, almost sweet.

Until the game crashes that is."

Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"Несмотря на:
— Вылеты.
— Принудительные совершенно нелепые бинды, вроде кнопки переключения радио или вызова какой-то бабы.
— Нелогичный перегруженный интерфейс с плитками.
— Невозможность без пляски с бубном отключить отвратительную музыку. Нет, чуваки, я серьёзно, вы не можете просто выключить музыку в настройках! Для этого при каждом запуске придётся включать неочевидную опцию.
— Чудовищный войс-актинг, который заставляет усомниться в адекватности ответственного за озвучку.
— Бесконечные загрузки.

Так вот, несмотря на всё вышеперечисленное, это совершенно. Невероятно. Oxyительно крутая игра! Стоит каждого потраченного шиллинга.

Восхитительно красивый мир, огромное количество реальных детально проработанных машин, физика, совершенно не свойственная аркаде, миллиард активностей. Игра абсолютно беззастенчиво кормит дофамином, и мне это нравится.
Тут можно играть в один только фото-мод.
Есть ощущение, что игру делали две команды — увлечённых прекрасных чуваков и каких-то мерзких затесавшихся инклюзивных пидapacoв, которым, несмотря на все усилия, не удалось испортить такую красоту.

Wreckfest,Racing,228380,kinda cool til the dynamics of the game got me a couple of times as i was leading. going down straight-sways. car decides to cut left or right into a wall of whatever. after the fifth time of the same issues> i'm done.  don't need to fight against the players just to get screwed by the game.
Wreckfest,Racing,228380,"This game is a hidden gem, just waiting to entertain the lucky owner for hours on end.  The crash physics, damage modeling, etc. is all leagues beyond any driving sim game.  Those have their place, but so does this one.  Do yourself a favor and add this one to your library."
Wreckfest,Racing,228380,"Forza fan here... FH4 network/servers showed me middle_finger_both_hands and said they don't like me anymore for online races. So I found my new crush instead!!! Wrrroommm... Craaaackk... Cluuuutch... Baaaanggg!!! Wreckfest racing!!!

Quickly and very subjectively summarising some main WF vs. FH4 points which made me enjoy playing WF:
- WF visuals are on par with FH4 (in some aspects even better and more detailed)
- WF car dynamics and reaction to driving on different surfaces feels kinda more real and less arcade-ish 
- WF  cars soft body destruction... well, nothing to compare here - it is 99% absent in FH4 for an understood reason : )
- WF cars sound more decent
- WF car bottoms are nicely detailed. FH4 has them as a single flat textured polygon.
- Controller mapping could be set almost 1 to 1 to a standard FH4 layout (manual + clutch) - Was very pleased that I had no discomfort form the first minute.

I extremely recommended for all Forza Horizon lovers (as an additional racing experience) to  give Wreckfest a try"

Wreckfest,Racing,228380,"This game has by far the best feeling of any driving game I've ever played.  It reminds me of the first time I played Driver on Playstation.

Wreckfest,Racing,228380,"This game is amazing!

I bought it on a bit of a whim, because it was on sale and I didn't have any drift or rally games. I have a decent sim-rig used mainly for Assetto Corsa and RFactor, which I also use for American Truck Simulator. Those are all quite sensible 'simulations', and I wanted something a bit more fun.

Well, Wreckfest is certainly fun! I imagine it's quite good using a gamepad using the top-down view, but with a force-feedback wheel, shifter, handbrake and pedals it's awesome.

The title doesn't really do it any favours, because there is more to this game than just huge crashes and wrecked cars. Yes, there are lots of demolition derby races, and even a last-car-standing mudpit. Watching the massive crashes on the replay is great fun. However, there are also lots of dirt track and circuit races too. The vehicle physics isn't going to worry Assetto Corsa any time, but it's still pretty realistic if you turn off all the driving aids. With a bit of handbrake you can set up some really impressive drifts, although the AI quickly proves that drifting is not the quickest way round the corners.

There's a bit of vehicle upgrading you can do, and to win some of the races you will need to upgrade the car. You can repaint your cars with a load of preset schemes, in an infinite range of colours.

Setting up all the different input devices was a doddle, although it defaults to automatic gears, and finding the setting to switch to manual took longer than it should have! Once I'd done that, it took a couple of minutes to map my handbrake and Fanatec shifter. I also had to remap the wheel and pedals because it had assigned the wrong axes. Easy to do. Unlike RFactor, which seems to forget all my devices every time I play it. Grrrr.

The default Force Feedback setting of 80% was far too high for my wheel. It was fighting me and causing tank-slappers. I turned it down to about 60% and it's way better.

Sadly, the game doesn't support head-tracking, and the FOV setting is rudimentary if you are using a single-screen sim-rig. That's a shame, because driving in-car instead of top-down is really immersive, but in a game like this you need to know where the other cars are. Your car doesn't have mirrors either. There is a HUD, but I have to confess I don't use it much because the game is REALLY intensive! I guess I'll just have to buy a couple more monitors...

The music gets a bit repetitive, which is a shame because it's suitably high-energy hard-rock. It feels like it needs more tracks.

Overall, a great fun game. Get it on sale, because there is quite a lot of DLC and you will want it all!"
Wreckfest,Racing,228380,it is sooo much fun especially when you have had a bad commute back home. So much fun

Wreckfest,Racing,228380,"It is fun but mostly in multiplayer,  the single player mode when you play against bot kinda sucks ngl. When you for example race it's almost everytime imposible to get first place. They should add a map where you don't race, just destroying your car in diffrent ways. But that isn't a mode yet.

DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,The actual GAME part is great but fuck CodeMasters for implementing terrible always online DRM in the SINGLEPLAYER GAME that has wiped all of my progress on several occasions.
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"Great racing experience, absolutely piss poor software and ""cloud saving"".  I have lost several hours of hard won racing because the game crashed and they reset my championships...  when I contacted customer service, they were basically like, yeah, fuck you, nothing we can do about it!  I have had to re-do so many things at no fault of my own its crazy.  Also, they are selling tracks from dirt rally 1 as DLC.  So I would have to pay twice for a map I already supported the development of.  I'll continue playing because I already own the game and I think the driving experience is good, but overall thumbs down and would not recommend to others"

Better with a wheel, I didn't believe when I saw people saying this game is hard it requires a lot of training otherwise you will be always running into trees, falling off cliffs and loosing control, if you love racing and rally you are going to love it."
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,Witness as the game takes your undivided attention for an hour just for you to hug the last tree before finish line and get terminal damage. Not only you will lose all your possible earnings you will also lose your hard-earned credits to repair the car you just trashed. This game will make you realise the difference between analog and digital input as you floor the gas on a Porsche. A racing game where if you finish in the top 1000’s you are a great player.
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"Just as Codemaster’s competitors were starting to creep towards the digital rallying crown, Dirt Rally 2.0 puts them firmly back in the rear-view mirror. Utterly convincing, enthralling and punishing, Dirt Rally 2 is an exquisite racing sim.
Good
Engrossing handling
Fantastic visuals
Audio presentation is perfect, with your co-driver proving essential
Bad
Shame to see extra tracks coming as paid DLC
Not really aimed at newcomers
My rate. 7.1"
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"DIRT Rally 2.0 is a very fun game, but is ABSOLUTELY NOT for someone who is just getting into racing games. As someone who has been playing racing games for about 15 years now, I am continuously challenged by this game. I rarely actually get upset at a game, but if any game can do it, it's this one.

I've found myself doing rally stages where I feel like i absolutely could NOT be going ANY faster, yet I am 8-14 SECONDS BEHIND FIRST! The game notifies you of this during your race, which is supposed to simply inform you of your current standing. But for me, I find myself trying to go even faster. Pretty much sealing my fate for the race. Not to mention you can only restart JUST A FEW TIMES. This means that if you crash, you could be seriously messing up your standings in the championship you're participating in, and could cost you hours of gameplay if you want to get first in every challenge.

I haven't discussed my main issue about this game, and it's hilariously simple; I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE CO-DRIVER VOICE. I'm surprised I haven't seen this elsewhere in reviews for this game, but I am shocked at just how awful the pace notes are for racing. The main reason for this is the way that the voice actor pronounces words. It's so frustrating to deal with while racing, and it really stands in the way of the whole experience.

For example, you'll be going ~80mph down a very tight dirt road, and will hear the co-driver suddenly say 

""5 Left into 6 right long-a into keep left over crest. 150-a into 4 right""

I'm sure you'll notice that behind a couple of words I've included a '-a'. This is because the voice actor for whatever reason pronounces certain words in the pace notes with an almost italian-esque 'a' at the end of them. For someone who is easily annoyed, this can be a bit frustrating, but the real issue with this is that it costs ACTUAL PRECIOUS METERS OF SPACE THAT YOU'RE DRIVING. I've literally completely OBLITERATED my car because of the actor taking too long to give me the appropriate pace notes. I've changed when the notes are read aloud, but it usually doesn't help, as the frequency in which the words are said, and the spaces in between them, are not changed. 

In the original DIRT Rally, which I'll admit I haven't played much of, there is a different voice actor for the co-driver, which is much more articulate, and is A LOT better than the one in this game. It completely astonishes me how annoyed I get about this, but now you've read my reasoning...

Other than these things, this game is seriously fun. The handling model is unforgiving, but it makes it feel as though you're behind the wheel of an unpredictable and hardcore rally car (or whatever other vehicle you're driving). The stats and driving characteristics of each vehicle are shockingly different to one another, even within the same class. This makes it so car shopping in this game is quite difficult! You have to find a vehicle you're comfortable with before taking it on a championship. I've made the mistake in-game of purchasing vehicles I couldnt afford, and then being too terrible at the game to even properly drive them. Lesson learned!

If you're a fan of racing games, I seriously do recommend this game. It's exciting and seriously makes you feel like a driving god as soon as you can barrel down tight snowy roads in a 50-year-old $500,000 dollar rally car at 80mph... and not die! It can get your heart rate up when you're inches away from falling off of a mountain while drifting along a tight corner. I've had a seriously fun time, regardless of how absolutely frustrating it can be at times.

DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"So, basically dirt Rally, but 110gb"
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,really wanted to give a good review but there's too much dlc that should of just been included in the base game. Its a great rally sim but i would wait for a sale
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"If you like chill solo races where you try to get the best time, it's perfect for you. The multiplayer is about the worst thing imaginable though, since you can't even see your friends on the track unless you play the rallycross mode that no one likes."
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"Every time I move from screen to screen the game has to spend 10+ seconds ""communicating with server"" ""uploading results"". Why the heck a single player game had to spend that much time doing network and why is the server so slow ???

DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"10/10 the co-driver clears his throat in between

THE BEST audio design, particle effects, track designs I have ever seen in a racing game.

It truly is the Dark souls of Racing

Wish they had a noob difficulty"
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,worth every regret
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"MAIN GAME -     DiRT Rally 2.0 is one of if not the best racing experiences it is perfect in almost every way the only down side of this game is driving on asphalt however it isn't the main focus of the game play everything from the car selection to the track selections is immaculate. VR support makes this game all the better if you have any VR headset what so ever i recommend playing with it even if you don't have a racing wheel just for the absolute immersion it causes. Career mode is perhaps one of the most challenging and rewarding modes of any game i have ever played and the progression system of the game gives you time to learn while also pushing you to your limits.

COLIN MCRAE DLC-      DiRT Rally 2.0's Colin McRae DLC is one that represents Colins racing career without being insensitive to his early death it is fun and adds a sense of campaign that wasn't present in the in the original game aside from the historic races."
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,Great game but way too hard for me:)
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,fuck you
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"Although I'm only 6 hours into this game, I can safely say it's worth buying. Of course, I got it for a very cheap price. The cars look great, the physics feel great, and the locations look great. I did roll a few times, before learning how NOT to drive. Fortunately, there are plenty of videos on YT for setups, and driving advice. Well worth the price, sale or not."
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"Don't let the steep leaning curve put you off picking up this game. It's true that the slightest mistake can cost you precious seconds and put you down a dozen places on the leaderboard, but that just makes the game all the more exhilarating."
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"лучший ралли сим для игры на руле (важно), в wrc можно играть на геймпаде, в дерт нет"
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,It's pretty hard but very enjoyable and sometimes can be very beautiful!
DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"It's one of the best rally sims out there. It has some detracting qualities such as always requiring an internet connection, but the physics engine is excellent and every location (including the DLC ones) is unique in its challenges. 

Real, visceral, intense. It can often give you the thrilling feeling of riding the knifepoint between disaster and victory. There's nothing that quite gives you a thrill like going flat out, in the dark and the rain, towards what looks like a wall, and knowing that you have to trust your co-driver over your own instincts.

If rally is cool to you and you want to experience it firsthand, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better option than this."

Project CARS 2,Racing,378860,Once I played Assetto. It immediately made projects cars 2 feel like a very slow toy.  i still like project cars 1 but 2 definitely just doesn't have that special something that makes me want to come back. It definitely does not have the speed immersion that Assetto or PCars 1 has.  So I give a thumbs down. Let's be real here. If you spend a lot on a wheel you will want the best experience right? Pass on this and 3. It did not improve.  Just a recommendation. Because money doesn't grow on trees.
Project CARS 2,Racing,378860,When i first bought this i was scared it was not gonna work for controller but with over 100 hours of play time i can confirm it works very well 9.5/10
Project CARS 2,Racing,378860,"I have been around race cars as far back as I can remember, from street modified, to NHRA to SCCA. When European sports cars were imported in the 80's, they had to be modified to meet U.S. safety regulations, as a kid I got to see my dream cars first hand.  It only made sense that I would be a race car driver. As it turned out, race cars are really expensive, even the crapy ones, and it only takes one high speed wreck to alter your life, so I pulled a Joe Dirt. Recently I got into race sims and pretty much obtained or purchased just about every one, and PC2 is hands down my favorite. Some of the racing games take the realism to a point where It's not really fun,  or the other end of the spectrum, it's like playing rad racer on NES. Project Cars 1 and 2 is in that perfect medium where it's not so realistic its like work, but not so unrealistic that its mind-numbing. In my opinion the easiest to set up with race sim rig as well, using simhub/dash panel etc."
Project CARS 2,Racing,378860,"It's a nice stepping stone between something like Forza and the ""true simulators"". The VR also works quite well"
Project CARS 2,Racing,378860,"While I initially loved this game for its immersiveness and graphics quality, this game constantly has issues with my Logitech G29 wheel. Every time I start the game, I can access the menu using the buttons on the G29, but it just won't detect my wheel and pedal inputs. I need to switch USB ports multiple times, connect the wheel via a USB hub instead of connecting directly to a USB port on my PC, reboot, or try some other method to get Project Cars 2 to detect my wheel inputs. Every other racing /sim game I have works perfectly fine with my wheel. Because of these issues, it frequently takes me 30-45 minutes of set up every time just to play this game. I'm honestly surprised that a popular sim like Project Cars 2 has such abysmal support for a popular wheel like the Logitech G29. I've finally decided that it's just not worth the hassle of troubleshooting this game for such a long time every time I want to play this game.

Steam refused to refund my purchase in spite of the game being unplayable, so beware before you buy."
Project CARS 2,Racing,378860,"Probably the best out-of-the-box racing game. A wide variety of content that's represented fairly well. Car and track models are nice. Sounds are lacking in some areas, but with the right volume mixing in the options it's fine. Default force feedback options for wheels are the biggest letdown - I'd urge wheel users to use Christiaan's Pure FFB file, it transforms the feeling of what the car is doing. 

It doesn't get everything right, but there's enough to keep you entertained."
Project CARS 2,Racing,378860,"An amazing driving experience... Unfortunately soiled by poor optimization, random glitches, and the omission of features such as custom championships. I could maybe forgive one or two of these issues, but:

-The game stutters, skips, and rubberbands, even on equipment exceeding the recommended specs with the newest drivers. You can be playing this and easily hold 100+ FPS at stable temperatures on the highest settings, but suddenly you will hitch and stutter. You think to yourself ""Maybe I should lower my settings even though this makes no sense."" and it does the same thing at 60FPS. Riddle me this, if I am playing at maximum settings and not pushing my equipment to maximum load.. Why am I having random performance jerks and stutters? Look on the internet, you will find dozens of people with hitches and fast-forward glitches, and you will find fixes that are nothing more than placebo. 

-No custom championships, really? REALLY? Assetto Corsa has Custom Championships and quite predates this game. I'd forgive this if not for...

-Static, unchanging career mode. In a game that prides itself on being the ultimate driver journey, and further prides itself on its weather system, which can pull real-time weather info from the real world... All of the weather in career mode is static, pre-programmed and scripted. Every race will always have the same weather, no matter what you do, this COMPLETELY removes replayability from the career, you are doing the exact same fixed races over and over again under the same conditions.

I wanted to love this game, I LOVE racing games, but this.. This ain't it chief."

I’m not saying it is the best, I just see Forza as some sophisticated simulation working for too many years and some people believe that's an unfair or unbeatable advantage. I don’t think that, given the proper work to convince me.

Here’s inside the British and both GT3 and GT4 cars including the tracks of its respective events, and of course its drivers. More about that down the review because of the DLCs, this isn’t exactly a slideshow of “civilian” cars; I love them but the thing here is about the corpo cars, filled with corpo decals, rather than fantasy racing running all naked. Given that, naturally the game abides to Blanpainc rules and regulations. You can race casually, but this isn’t one of those games.

Steering and artificial intelligence is slowly nearing there, even if with unstable curving trying to maintain it, still I have never experienced this before and you can impress other game’s drivers. Everytime I run Assetto Corsa Competizione I can almost smell the gas, if it wasn’t for a few things that still aren’t quite there but hopefully will one day. If you’re interested in this only for screenshots or to admire the scenery, random npcs or how good the grass looks, you got another thing coming. The graphics didn’t impress me and screen shot “cinema hud” options are weird to work with.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513870458

Those are tertiary elements in the scale of importance. What the driver is really interested in after buying; emulation, simulation, steering - I emphasize that part, and competition with all that in motion. But if they want us to truly smell the carbon dioxide, they gotta work more on the outtern details too, more immersive particle effects. That screenshot has filters and reshade mods that the game should have in first place, that impacted my final scoring in this review.

My first phase testing with the Lamborghini Youngster Programme was humiliating, as if I have never been behind any steering wheels. Yes I had to borrow from a nearby friend just to feel like a pro, but once I returned it, I had to readapt myself with a Xbone joystick - but don’t think this limited me, I managed to program it for the level of realism I like even with a joystick.

After taking care of my control situation, I decided to tweak my black demon. They give you a Huracàn Super Trofeo that growls like a devil hissing for meat, demanding sacrifices in the temple of speed. The devs decision to start the career at Monza was just too right.

So instead of 60 liters - the default fuel quantity they give you, I deducted only the enough amount for 5 laps instead around 21 liters, super basic but we tend to forget about these - because the game isn’t interested in doing everything for me which is great. Easing pressure, caring about the brakes and other dynamics and vóila, I could finally reach third to last position (better than last position) and with better knowledge I started climbing the ladder. I’m more interested in learning through experience and readings, but you can always look for setups around the the internet and then place it on your files and load it up.

The dynamics are so beautiful and harmonical, so realistic, I could finally see why some pilots in history performed better during rainy weather, to experience that for the first time in my gaming life - ever. Guys like Ayrton Senna in the F1 category for example and so many others.

The fight is different during the rain in the real world, your worries are condensed and the car and the tires are sliced. Little to none beneficial things like cooler brakes and bad omens like thin layers of water under the tires. A driver in the rainy weather would prefer to use the best line to avoid that part of the track that still is wet, not just water puddles because it is more complex than that - the fight during rainy weather is different and this is simulated on where it should. ACC proved me I’m a rainy racer, having greater time results whenever Jupiter is angry.

That doesn’t mean the casual should avoid it, but I’m afraid they would rather play something else, Competizione still can be tough even on easier modes. The setup isn’t like Dirt Rally 2.0 for example, with bars to slide around even on advanced setups (you’d see bars but it’s different) you either know what you’re doing or you do not. It is intuitive enough to keep you interested in it, experimenting, but you will need to know it anyway because there are not enough hints if you’re out of place. There are only a couple of basic pre-settings, but very often they’re not enough, just a rough bet for the things you’re going to face.

The hud seems overwhelming at first but you can remove things. I don’t recommend that because the devs thought about everything, even swapping colors in the speed meter when you need to shift but got no time to look at it, meant to alert your peripheral vision.

𝘼𝘽𝙊𝙐𝙏 𝙏𝙃𝙀 𝙑𝙍 𝙏𝙃𝙄𝙉𝙂

I don’t own any VR and no hero in my vicinity does, can’t rent around here either so you won’t have my views on that, as ironic as it sounds. There is a camera angle you can choose like a first person view from inside the helmet, but I don’t see much bobblehead physics, maybe it wouldn’t work? There is no gravity simulation shaking that camera angle nor when I brake too hard and I think simulation should start thinking about that.

[olist][*]The crowd people are what we call “cardboard audience” here where I live, very outdated. When the crowd is 3D (npcs from the pitstops for example) they’re badly animated. We’re not in 2006 anymore, so please.

[*]Rain sprites droplets are nasty, like most frames based graphics in this game are and it needs updating. It isn’t better, not even in “epic” settings. More particles are needed too.

[*]Not so rarely, impact sound effects are just repetitive even when you’re performing something else not related to that. You’d hear some clanks and bumps when not clanking nor bumping, although minimal it is undermining the attention to details it already has.

[*]Artificial intelligence does suffer from the conditions of the track, but it could be better. Most super simulated games only think about you and your sweaty fights. AI needs to be prone to mistakes more often, maybe some sort of fear-factor and stress like humans do. I don’t know how the hell they would do it, but it is awful to see that they don't do much.

[*]The game demands more identity, and the career mode is the way to do that. You’re welcomed by pilot Mirko Bortolotti himself trying to warn/prepare you for what is about to come, then not much is shown, game needs more style. Not just cosmetics but further expansion of career mode. I just think details aren’t enough to rival other games right now.[/olist]

About DLCs It could have been worse but they removed the dreadered Imola circuit from the base game. Separating immortal classic circuits in different packs mixing it with cars that maybe you don’t need or want. They compressed it with little decency left but if they want to keep me around, stop increasing it as the base game isn’t really that cheap either. Just wishlist these and wait for a discount."

Assetto Corsa Competizione,Sports,805550,Painful fun.
Assetto Corsa Competizione,Sports,805550,"I enjoy this game so much. Driving feels AWESOME, with some time and trial&error i made it playable for me with a controller and i cant wait to play this with a wheel in winter when the CSL DD wheelbase arrives. Even the online community is for the most part very fair, there are some exceptions, but even iRacing cant guarantee every move to be fair and clean. Id 100% recommend this game to any simracer and/or GT3/4 Fan."
Assetto Corsa Competizione,Sports,805550,"This is it right here.

It doesn't get any better."
Assetto Corsa Competizione,Sports,805550,"Optimisation has come a long way: I can get above 45 fps with high-demand settings like shadows and reflections turned down 1 notch with 30+ cars in the rain on a 2060s and 2700x.

If you come in with a driving style that suits other games, you will understeer constantly and catastrophically. Forcing the setup to fix this will result in uncontrollable oversteer. You have to relearn how to approach a corner and feel how the cars want to be driven. ""Slow in and fast out"" is more important than ever. Once you've mastered the art of gentle turn-in, the cars feel so alive. Other positives are that the AI actually race themselves (especially at higher difficulty settings), cars all feel different, sounds are absolutely incredible (engine, transmission, exhaust crackles, gears, suspension, bodywork, abs/tc) and the camera views are super customisable. The only negative is that AI difficulty is all over the place, and you can only set it once in career mode. For example I could easily match AI pace at Zolder on Pro difficulty, but on the same difficulty was 3.5 seconds off the pace at brands hatch."

I hope you found this review helpful! Please leave me a rating, and give me your thoughts in the comments, as I would love to hear feedback, ideas, and what personal experiences you've had with this title. This installment of Assetto Corsa defines sim racing as a whole. It is beefed up with graphics and realistic driving and destroys its predecessor and iRacing in comparison. This is worth it 100% and so are the DLC's depending on your race style."

If you have a wheel, this is an insane sim for GT3 and GT4.

At some turn, my car catches understeer, then oversteer because of different road coverages (snow, ice, and asphalt). Few meters from my car was BMW X5. I've started a course correction and haven't hit BMW. But the next moment I've figured out that I'm on the top of a 1.5-meter snowdrift. 
I bet it would scare everybody. But after 200+ hours of DIRT RALLY, I felt it like NATURAL. I've pushed the GAZ pedal, haven't stop and carefully left that snowdrift back on the road.

Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"It's been a while since I played a NFS game. The last NFS game I enjoyed was Prostreet and Shift.  

Why I bought it?
I bought this game after I saw it on sale and read the positive reviews. I had stayed away from the franchise as it had become stale in recent years and it seemed like this game was much better than what was offered in the past. I even checked out some channels on Youtube that made long format reviews and they too praised it for what it had to offer. 

What was good?
The graphics are amazing. The game looks really good and it runs very well on my computer. The cars and the options to customise them is excellent. I like all the cars that were included in the game and loved how they handle and sound. There are numerous ways to customise your car and I'm not sure what was included in previous games but I really liked the options they gave us. I spent a lot of time customising the cars and enjoyed looking at various user generated paint jobs that you could apply on your car. It was fun to see what the community had designed and I used a lot of them on my cars. You can also choose your character and customise the clothes your character wears. I also liked that they had off road racing in addition to road racing. You have to tune your car for these races and it was fun to change things up. Finally, the map was well done - very detailed and fun to drive around. Palm city is very beautiful and there are different districts within the map that have its own features.  

What sucked?
I grew up playing the original NFS games and the Underground games were my favourite. The original Most Wanted however is perhaps the gold standard. NFS Heat, to put it bluntly, simply does not measure up to what those games offered. I don't think progression has been made and I'll list my issues with this game. First, the racing aspect of NFS Heat. In the past, we had variety in the types of races. In this game, all we have are Circuits, Sprints and Drifts. Drifts are not even races - you've got to beat a score by driving on the track solo. They do switch it to off-road tracks but on the off-road tracks, you again have Circuits and Sprints. For comparison, in the Underground games and Most Wanted, you had drag races, outruns, speed traps, toll booths and you drifted with competition instead of being solo on the track. You also had pink slips and higher winnings if you played at higher difficulty levels or had good timings. Second, they've pulled out aspects of the game that were fun in the past. Like getting your car on a magazine cover with a pretty girl for making your car look nice. You could take pictures of the car by showing off how you'd customised it as well for the magazine cover. You'd even have races that you'd need to win to get on the magazine cover. Anyone that played Underground 2 will know what I'm talking about. Third, while I can live with certain features being pulled out, I don't understand why they changed the ""Heat"" system in the game. The way this system works in this game is not fun at all. I lose the heat I earned and it resets after the night ends.Why don't the police care when I break traffic rules during the day? They only care at night for whatever reason. The police are overpowered - I mean they do give us options to defend ourselves but the damage system limits the fun. Why limit the fun? Who cares about damage to your car? Bashing cops is what made police chases fun! All I do in this game is get my Heat level up by winning races and once the multiplier kicks in and I have a nice chunk of points, I end the night. I can't bash the police, destroy road blocks and simply have fun toying with them. My car is fragile, takes damage and at higher Heat levels, cops can do a lot of damage and have insane driving skills.  You tend to play it safe so that you don't lose the multiplier that influences your reputation points. They could've at least given infinite repairs at gas stations but again, the entire damage system limits the fun! I can understand what they went for in this game, but in my opinion, realism in an arcade racing game makes no sense. Fourth, the soundtrack isn't great. A couple of songs are good but most are not memorable. My fifth and final point, the story. Good Lord - who wrote this trash? What have they done to the story lines in these games? It doesn't have to be a masterpiece but c'mon man!! Let me give you one of the story lines - spoilers - skip to closing comments if you don't want to know this story. I'm putting this in to highlight why the story sucks. They talk about how you have to get into the ""League"" - the ""League"" being a group of drivers that are considered elite. As the story progresses, you have TWO races with League members and are admitted to the ""League"" AFTER completing the main story and exposing the bad guy!!! There are no races against other League drivers - there is no struggle, rising up the ranks - you are simply admitted to the league because you had TWO races with League members as a part of a story related mission. What????? How did I prove I was elite? I only beat the two drivers in the League - they even sort of imply that it's not a race and they are sort of doing it to help your mission. Why did Leagues members even want to help me? Why do they care? Why didn't I get to race the best driver in the League? Why couldn't I beat that guy and become the best driver? Why couldn't I take his car and title as reward for beating him? Why couldn't he have betrayed me at the beginning of the game by stealing my car or threatening my girl?  Good Lord - you can come up with so many story lines and make it way more interesting than what was in this game.

Closing Comments:
I don't know what has happened to this franchise. On a superficial level, this game is simply the best. Graphics, customisation, environment, cars, sounds and all of that - nothing in the NFS franchise compares. In terms of game play, they've taken out the fun. It feels like the people that design these games are not gamers. Even if they are gamers, they are not allowed to take risks or innovate. I've made a lot of comparisons to older NFS games and maybe that's not fair. But think about it, if NFS Heat was on it's own and was released as the first NFS game, would ""Need for Speed"" be the franchise it is? To summarise, NFS Heat offers a sterile and boring experience. I finished the game, did some side stuff and I can tell you for certain that I will not replay this game. If you have a Need for Speed, then this is not the game you are looking for."

[h1]Comment[/h1]
[hr][/hr]
Need for Speed™ Heat is the latest installation of EA has and sadly their devs ""Ghost Games"" have shut down meaning there will be no more official updates that we can hear about this game. The car customization here is solid, the physics are slightly arcadey, however there is a drift or grip car as it was always there since the Need for Speed™ (2015). The cops here are very aggressive most of us liked it and most of us did not but for me I love it. Grinding Money and XP here is very different from any average games out there. They have implemented Day and Night race that turns out to be different, if you're in a Day Race you'll get a credits for every race you win. But in the Night, things are getting interesting, one race of a night will make the cops look for you and at the night race or a cop chase gets you an XP. (basically they call it a REP). As for multiplayer, you can only get to play with your friends here, because everyone has their own business. Additionally you can't remap your controller aside from your keyboard. Also this game is expensive costing at $80 because they only offer us on PC version is the Deluxe Edition and not the standard ones so I find it difficult to buy it at full price. If you consider to buy this game, buy it on sale. [b]Recommended![/b]"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Although I do recommend NFS:H, there's a lot of glaring issues with the game. I'll start with the good:

1. Customization
I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of customization available. There's a lot of name brand bodykits (Liberty Walk, C-West, Rocket Bunny), wheels (Work, BBS), and stickers. You can also tune your car based on the type of driving you plan on doing (off-road, drift, race, on-track). Even the most minuscule details can be added, like stretched tires. There's also an option to customize the pitch of your exhaust, which I thought was very helpful.

2. Car Options
There are a solid amount of cars in this game available for customization. Each appeals to different tastes: you have JDM legends such as the RX-7 and GTR, American muscle like Mustang and Corvette, and exotics from the Countach to McLarens. You can customize all of them in unique ways as well.

3. Setting
Palm City is a representation of Miami. It's an large city with a lot of beaches and palm trees, the aesthetic you'd expect. The map is pretty big and has some diversity in each zone it's divided into. I really like the look of Palm City itself, especially at night.

4. Running ability
I have a shitty laptop (GeForce 940MX, i5-6300HQ, 8 GB RAM) and NFS actually runs really well. Even if you have the minimum, the game still looks pretty.

Now time for the cons. These are mostly just mild inconveniences but the first three are major issues and what I believe to be the weak points of the game.

1. Story
The story kind of sucks and is the standard cookie-cutter ""make a name for yourself"" plot out of every single racing game on earth. It's not bad, just mediocre at best. I haven't finished the game completely and can't fully judge the story yet, but I've heard complaints about it being short and how you barely do anything to qualify for this ""super elite group"" at the end.

2. Police system
The worst part about the game by far. Once these mfs show up, you can guarantee you either have to increase your heat by destroying one of them or lose all your money and experience once they bust you. The cops are way too fast to outrun, they will always be on your tail. It makes sense why this would happen in the supercharged Charger they bring out if you keep running, but not the normal Crown Vics the cops have. You're driving a highly tuned race car! That Crown Vic should have gotten dusted in seconds. You just have to get lucky in the instance that the cop hits a wall or another car and can't catch up fast enough.
The cops also spawn in a way that makes it really easy for them to join a chase and soon enough you have 4 cops on your ass. I get the ""reinforcements arriving"" part but the spawns get incredibly annoying. Did I mention that destroying cop cars barely works because your own car takes damage as well, which is a mechanic entirely new to the series?
Why don't cops care if you do anything during the day? Why do they only bring out the ultra-zealous unit at night? It's like playing GTA, you could run a red light going 160 in the opposite lane past a cop and they don't even mind. If one spots you at night after you do a street race, they go ham.
The radio chatter bothers me so much, it sounds like they got a whole bunch of children who just learned swear words to record the lines. I get that the cops at night are supposed to be super aggressive and mean, but oftentimes it backfires horribly and just makes me laugh. When [spoiler] Ana's car gets impounded [/spoiler] the cop who did it made me cry laughing. He sounded like a R. Lee Ermey from Wish. 
Your character: ""Yes, sir.""
The officer: ""YES, OFFICER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""
Overall, I feel like the police system could have been implemented a lot better. I personally would have made them easier to outrun initially, but if you continue to have run-ins with them, it becomes harder to do so.

3. Soundtrack
Aside from a few exceptions (Out The Mud by Future and Lil Baby comes to mind), the soundtrack gets old really quickly. It consists of rap music and an overwhelming amount of Latin and EDM tracks. I get that Latin kind of sets the vibe of summer and EDM is popular within NFS games, but it really seems like there's a total of 10 songs in the game. Unless you really like hearing Cardi B's verse in ""Writing on the Wall"" or the same shitty bass drop 50 times every two hours, I'd suggest muting the audio and playing your own music in the background.

4. Exhaust popping
This is the really nitpicky stuff at this point, but it bothers me so much. When driving your car, by default it's tuned to a really aggressive ""pop and bang tune"" setup that is honestly ridiculous. Heavily tuned cars in real life tend to backfire when downshifting, but in this game it's incredible how much they do so. If you slam down the gas from a dead stop, all you hear is POP POP POP POP POP until you hit second gear. Thankfully you can make it stop in the exhaust tuning menu, but the fact that it's enabled by default is strange.

5. Types of races
I was disappointed by the amount of races included in this game. There seems to be only 3: sprints, circuits, and drifting. Drifting isn't even a race, rather, it's just trying to beat a score. Previous NFS games had a lot more diversity when it came to the amount of races, and it's unclear why this downgrade happened.

6. Destruction of obstacles
While this game was really nostalgic to me in terms of similarity to classic arcade racing games I played, I didn't think it would extend THIS far. If you crash into just about anything, it falls apart and disappears. Trees, cement columns, stone walls, etc. It was honestly very strange to hit a tree for the first time and see it collapse instead of your car just hitting the tree like in GTA. Although it stays true to the arcade genre, this aspect definitely detracts from the realism.

7. Car damage system
I mentioned how this mechanic existed in the police section, but it's implemented oddly. The police are the only ones who can seriously damage your car, and they will fully disable it in about 4 hits. Strangely, your car is basically invincible otherwise. You can crash head-on with another car at 150 mph and only suffer a single pixel line of red on the damage meter. The only thing that can really harm your car outside of police is falling from a height.

8. Amount of pedestrians/vehicles
The first one makes sense, because having cars run over random people is too GTA-esque, but it definitely takes away from the realism: the city just feels empty. The second is a blessing and a curse: there are very few vehicles, but they only seem to spawn in places inconvenient to you. Trying to pass that stupid Mustang in a night race? G35 spawns right in front of you and you crash right into it head on! The cars will spawn in discreetly, i.e. around a corner, but they just serve as inconveniences most of the time. The diversity of NPC vehicles are also very lacking, there's basically 4 in total. All I really see are a G35, BMW 3-series, some pickup truck, and an ambulance.

While the strong points of this game are there, a lot of smaller issues also exist with it as well. This game was really nostalgic since it appealed to my childhood playing arcade racing games at Funway. As a car enthusiast, I had a lot of fun with this game so far and I'm eager to put even more hours into it. My experience was good, but the issues were things that temporarily distracted me from my enjoyment of the game. I can see why they would be bigger for other people and cause them to dislike the game.
Also grab this on sale if you can, I got it during the Open Worlds sale for like $14 and that's so much better than the exorbitant retail price of $70. I'd say this game is worth $60 max. This game is also from EA, so you have to install Origin on your computer (if you don't have it already). Origin has been heavily criticized and is incredibly slow, so be mindful of that."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"i thought i could trust the reviews for this game but i was wrong. the game is decent enough to be better than payback; they settled for decent rather than polishing some of the genuinely good mechanics it was going for. generic formula good enough to please the low standards of current NFS fans.

music is garbage and for a racing game their car assets look mediocre. always raining. we get it, you added misting and dynamic puddles."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"I paid 19 EUR for this game as part of a bundle with NFS Hot Pursuit Remastered. Since they seem to be evenly priced otherwise I'll judge it as if I've paid 9.50 EUR for it alone.

Long story short... not even close to worth it. I went in with very low expectations since I'm familiar with Ghost's previous work and even I was taken back by just how bad this game is.


GRAPHICS & PERFORMANCE:

- It's very poorly optimized... like, very, very poorly optimized. It even lags during the pre-rendered cutscenes. Lowering most of the graphics settings makes absolutely no difference performance wise, only the supersampling does.
- Takes a very long time to load, we're talking GTA5 loading times here, on an SSD.
- No dynamic time of day, despite the fact that the previous game (as well as pretty much every open world game made after 2015) has it.
- Car damage was downgraded from the previous games, which is a shame because it was quite good.
- Way too much teal, this is a problem that's plagued Frostbite for years but Ghost actually seemed to have fixed it in the previous game, now it's back with a vengeance.

+ Car models look great... at least on the outside.
+ Doesn't ask you to restart the game when changing graphics options.
+ Whereas other recent-ish games downscale the graphics to improve performance, NFS Heat actually gives you that option. It's too bad most of us will be forced to use it anyway, but it's nice that it exists.
+ Despite the horrendous performance the game does look quite crisp, even when downscaled to 75%.


AUDIO:

- Car sounds are pretty mediocre, they're unique to each car for the most part but none of them are anything to write home about. The sound tuning mechanic is ambitious but doesn't seem to actually affect the sound that much.
- Soundtrack is terrible, literally just sounds like the lead sound engineer just pasted his Spotify playlist into it and called it a day.
- Very buggy, car sounds cutting out briefly is quite common.
- Voice acting makes Undercover look like Citizen Kane.


CONTROLS:

- Much like it's predecessors it features virtually NO mouse support aside from moving the camera around in the garage, that's it.
- Hands down the worst keyboard driving controls I've ever seen in a driving game of any kind, even Flatout 3 driving is better, let that sink in.


SINGLEPLAYER:

+ Bodywork customization is alright, not nearly as ambitious as Underground 2 or Carbon but it's pretty decent.

- Paint customization has been dowgraded from the previous games, the material editor was replaced with pre-made materials which offer a bit more variety but cannot be used on vinyls.
- Performance customization has a lot of options, including engine swaps. However they are all linear upgrades, it's not like Forza where you have to pick & mix your parts carefully depending on the class or type of race, here the highest level parts/engines are always meta.
- The story is mediocre, which is probably the worst thing you can say about it. Since it's neither good enough to be memorable nor bad enough to be funny, it's just... meh.
- The day/night switching mechanic is unnecessary and only limits gameplay. Also feels more like an excuse for not featuring a dynamic time cycle.
- The driving physics are virtually non-existent. Also it reverted back to the NFS15 style of brake-to-drift mechanic, meaning that your car starts drifting whenever it wants to. This is a problem Payback did not have.
- The police AI is copy-pasted from Payback except they appear in free roam now, which would be great if it weren't for the addition of a health bar that cuts your chase short if you even think about having any fun.


MULTIPLAYER:

- No text chat.
- Matchmaking is quite poor, though not nearly as bad as Forza Horizon 4's.


OTHER:

- Car list is poor, it's also copy-pasted from Payback with barely any new cars, except now they've added like 3 - 4 variants of each. They did bring back Ferrari though, for what it's worth... which isn't much given that none of the cars in this game really drive like cars.
- Sticks ads and political messaging in your face when you're in the main menu.
- It has a very short life expectancy considering the DRM it uses, the fact that EA already ended support for it, the fact that Ghost is on the chopping block AND the fact that it didn't have that many players to begin with.
- EA


If you're itching for an arcade racing game get Forza Horizon 4, you'll likely pay a lot more but it looks, sounds and plays a lot better... when the servers are working at least."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Did you know you can't even remap your controller in this game? Even after over 10 years of developing driving games, you're stuck with one controller layout the entire game. *claps*"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"EA Origin messed up loading of the game. Can' even boot in, how am I suppose to play this. I believe this is a good game buy optimize your origin better. I""m out"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"If you have Forza Horizon 4 don't buy this, plus the music if awful."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"First NFS i played? NFS III. Last one i played before Heat? Rivals.
Other racing games i played recently: The crew 2, Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally 2.0, Project Cars 2 and Forza Motorsport 7.


This game feels like a downgrade from Rivals. Not in all aspects, tho 

where it goes right:

-It is challenging, opponents and pursuits can give you a run for your money.
-It's straightforward (most NFS games are)
-You can customize your car to levels lost in NFSU2
-Car variety.

But It also borks a lot of things:

Characters and voice overs are lame, not as lame as payback, but that was never NFS strong point after MW 2005. Soundtrack is quite forgettable, 
The inability to disable the tap throttle do drift thing is utterly annoying, I don't wanna drift in every damn corner, handling in general feels stiff and quite heavy.
City seems post apocalyptic, everything seems dead, even the very low traffic density reinforces that idea.
Graphics for some reason are okay, even maxing everything out on ultra, it doesn't seem/feel like a 2019/2020 game.

If you wanna some fun, don't wanna anything complex and only like cars, get NFS Heat (or warez rivals, since the official system is borked), If you like a pickup and play racing game with variety, Get the Crew 2. IF you like realism, you're in the wrong place, pal.

I'm refunding this one, i guess i had too high hopes ot this isn't simply my cup of tea.

Not worth the full price, get it on sale."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,Car so fast I got pulled over in real life !
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"[h1]Short description:[/h1] Only buy it if you like good graphics, cars and customization and the game is on sale.

[h1]Long description:[/h1]
I really love car customization games, and this game has [b]a lot of options[/b] I appreciate. You can make [u]your own designs[/u] and there are [u]crazy paint options[/u] for many hours of editing. It still has some flaws; you cannot make a group of decals, or save a group of decals to save it and use it in multiple designs, lack of decal navigation shortcuts (these features are present in Forza games). 

Speaking about gameplay, the driving mechanics are pretty basic and arcade (as expected). But there is one thing I did not like: a [b]horrible double-tap to drift[/b] on the gas pedal button. This was a game breaker for me, in my opinion, one of the worst ideas ever implemented, but maybe people liked it, maybe it is just not my taste.

Another con is that [b][u]you CANNOT remap controller keys[/u][/b]. Even having an official Xbox One controller, I had to use the great Steam controller configuration for my buttons to do what I want. Honestly this is a super scumbag idea. Not sure if this is a rocket science thing or something you cannot integrate in the game engine, but c'mon, this is a basic game feature.

About the police when they chase you, man, that thing is brutal. Be careful when you race at night. I have not played too much in the night but last time I tried, the cop cars felt like damn ferrari indestructible tanks.

Also you may have trouble when starting up the game, because EA Origin and EA Desktop are not the same and present problems when you start the game and they are both active. You will have to close EA Desktop and leave EA Origin open to start the game. 

If at this point,  playing NFS Heat still sounds good to you, then I'm pretty sure you will enjoy the game."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,its fun and hard
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"I wanted to have my nostalgia moment with this arcade racer but NFS heat does not quite feel like any former NSF game.

The story was cringe and the game only has 20 or so soundtracks all of which do not appeal to me, to say it lightly.
The open world racing aspect I didn't really notice it felt mostly empty with maybe 1/3 player visible on the map in a 1h span.

Graphics are great and it ran smoothly.

Would recommend only for NSF hardcore fans"

Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"I would give this game a 8/10. The gameplay is a lot like the newer NFS Most Wanted. Like in Most Wanted, you cannot be a cop. The story line is reasonably good, but not the best. The car customisation, however, is incredible. You can even customise the sound of your exhaust! I would play this game just for this aspect. The soundtrack is also reasonably good. It brought back some memories of PS2 and XBOX 360 NFS games. Its worth buying if you are a NFS fan."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"fast as f*ck boi
"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"It is a nice game but I am never going to play it ever again, as I lost my account(maybe) / as my progress got overwritten by something(probably) / someone hacked into it to get my progress instead of playing the game normally(maybe) / the progress got switched to someone who created a new account(maybe), I still recommend it tho"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Need for speed Heat is a good arcade like racing game like how undercover and most wanted back in 2000s, this one is futuristic but still got the same feel but more to grinding.

The game overall it's great but I dislike how cops in night mode are very intense and heat level 3 above, it's really weird how normal cops can overtake you in the pursuit LOL. The storyline feels too short and there are many to discover.

At least it's better than NFS Payback (8/10)"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Fun to play. The only complain that I have is that I couldn't run the game at the beginning (Origin said that the game wasn't installed). All I had to do to fix it was running steam as admin and it worked.

Also, the songs are cool but very limited and it gets boring after the first hour of playing."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"I'm not sure what they are trying to do with the story but it isn't working. This is the closest they have come but they still can't get back to that peak era on the playstation 2 in 2003-2006 with underground, underground 2, most wanted, carbon"

Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,its bad game okay racing
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"If you're looking for a game to suck up hours of your time while you waste all your cash on a new car you don't need and modding it and then never drive it again, then this is the game for you. 

Seriously though, its a fun game. The acting and story line is about as serious as this game is about being a racing sim."

btw I literally finish the first mission in gta V in 1 hr. cause I'm bad at driving. ^_^"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Honestly would be an amazing game, if it didn't crash everytime i get on it"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,fun times
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Great game. Lots of fun. Lots of events. Lots of cars. Lots of customization. Music is awesome! Love it so much I have it playing on Spotify when I'm in my car.
Police can be a real pain when you're low level but later it's such a fun game of cat and mouse with them.
The cars and engine do have their own character. Not every engine fits every car. Not all cars are created equal. There are huge differences. I don't wanna spoil anything so get out there and find out for yourself!
Have fun!"

Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,fantastic game.
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,good luck
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"I highly recommend it, if you like easy drifting and easy driving mechanics. The graphics are beautiful and you don't have to expect any FPS drops. Every car looking fine as hell. The cops are way too annoying because it's almost impossible to escape from them. The only tip i can give you is to drive over jumps. Use jumps to escape them. But this game turned out very good!"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Purchased this game for my nephew, worth it"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Considering a $79.99 game I though this would be a typical 3-A game but it's not. The main story was only 10 hours long, the side story was cliche and boring - just a tutorial regarding the drift and off-road event. More importantly, as the same developer of NFS20, Ghost game seems like just ""borrow"" a lot of elements from NFS20- almost same car collection, RSR and Regera are still the king (kinda disappoint about Fxx-k and P1 GTR's performance), same refitting system. tbh there's not enough changes and new elements as a NFS new series."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,Peli on erittäin hyvä ja koukuttava
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"After all that time watching a close comparison of NFS Heat with titles like Forza Horizon 4 I had an impression that this time they might have done at least halfway good NFS game. No they did not. Again, you have absolutely no idea what your car will do as physics are built on theoretical fantasies of someone who imagined racing on the acid trip. It's all scripted, try to control cornering speed by throttle, you will start to drift. Try to actually drift and it will do whatever but drifting. Yes, graphically it's an eye candy, list of cars is not overwhelming but all essentials are there, customisation options are something you can spend hours on but gameplay, the main reason why you want to spend your time with this is just disappointing, nearly frustrating. There is no joy in taking the car for a spin and messing around with it's limits since it's all disgustingly fake. Waited for sale on this, spend a tenner, still not worth it."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"If you like the series, or simply like the racing genre, this game is for you. Open world game, with several activities to do within the game (drift, off-road, etc). Pretty good game to chill (if you're day racing, f*** night races). ProTip: cycle between day and night (not the most effective, but less repetitive, so more fun)

Pros:
- Racing game ""4fun"", not difficult to control the car like other racing games (Shift 2, Grand Turismo...)
- Fair grind time to get top-of-the-line cars and equipment (10-15 hours and you can have the best gear available to buy for your cars)
- Online mode that allows you to run story-line races simultaneously (no solo play required)
- Numerous possible customizations for the cars, including community wraps for the cars.
- You can progress with your friends if you want (the game even rewards you for doing this)

Cons:
- Completely random ""invisible"" hitboxes near the curb that sometimes collide with the car during turns (maybe something to do with the car heights? idk)
- Night races are a cancer, full of lights and reflections, and random cars that pop up from beyond, along with spawned police cars that pop up on the minimap out of nowhere (can be extremely tilting after a while)
- I can't stand listening to the SAME songs in each running style anymore. If you like a song that plays during the day, but you have to spend HOURS listening to the songs at night and not have the option to simply listen to the others, it's a nuisance. The resolution is simple, turn off in-game music and play your playlist. However, you lose some of the immersion.
- The best races (in terms of Rep reward and money) are always the same, so after a while it becomes repetitive and boring.
- Drift is kind of bad in this game.

Graphics: 9/10
Gameplay: 8/10
Soundtrack: 7/10 (the songs are like ""folders"", with a fixed playlist for each activity - varying between day and night, and in or out of a race. You can skip songs, but you can't choose them. If it's day time race, there's like 10-12 songs you can hear during the race. There's 58 songs total... Songs are good, but try hearing the same 10 songs over and over)

In summary: 7.5/10

Buy on sale (if you're going to play a lot), or if you just want to see what the game is, EAPlay is enough. In my case, I prefer to have the game to play as much and whenever I want without having to play for just 1 month."

Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,Great game. Better than Payback. The customization is really cool and Palm City is looking great. Soundtrack is also good IMO. The police AI is also great and very challenging. 9/10. Would definitely recommend to a friend.

Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,speed
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Perhaps the best Need For Speed Game since HP2010.

The police pursuits are absolutely intense in the night time, the music helps a lot. Finally its a NFS game where you fear the police at high notoriety. No more pursuits where you take down police by the dozen using a giant doughnut. You run from them.

The pursuits feel extremely balanced, early games about taking risks and pushing how long you can stay out before the heat gets too much. Then come later game you don't fear the night, for now. But once Heat 5 hits you're panicking because all it takes is one rhino, or one kill switch and your night could be over in an instant.

Daytime racing is something I'm happy to see, police in the day are much tamer, won't actively chase you and will also only engage with you if you ram them. Day racing is like Forza Horizon 1, its mostly sanctioned and traffic only appears outside of races, races will also have barricades and a crowd to add to this, its all about earning money here with no risks due to unlimited repairs and low police presence.

The car list is great, it has more modern tuners like the Ford Focus 16' RS, a personal favourite of mine from this game, and older tuners such as the Nissan R32 Skyline and Honda Civic. Muscle cars are in good numbers too with old classics like the Camaro SS and Ford Mustang '65, although customisation for these cars are a little more limited since there aren't many wheels or hoods that fit muscle cars. Theres also a good variety of modern hypercars and classic supercars like the Ferrari F40.

The meat of customisation comes from the livery editor feature, you can upload and download others liveries for your cars to use, it is fun to see whats on there, especially if you end up wanting to drive around a Lighting McQueen Corvette or cover your Golf GTI in anime. Although there are a few NSFW vinyls and ones with hate-speech

I'd say its worth a buy, Heat certainly holds its own against the NFS games, and could easily deserve to be called the best NFS game since Blackbox's older titles."

Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"the only game where ford Victoria police car is faster than a Ferrari and lambos. Also why the stupid driving didn't change make it more realistic.
The only positive thing is the cross-play server you can play with the xbox or ps4."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"=====BEFORE YOU BUY!!====
This game bring most back to old Need For SPeed game with some combination from old games!

Pros :
-Good Graphic and scenery that can make you actually enjoy the free roam!
-Supports Controller, and it;s not that hard for keyboard user like me
-Huge Car modification (Engine, Body, Vinyl, etc)
-Cool cutscene and car Transition whenever u start a race or quit form garage
-Very hard cops to deal with!
-Day and Night Racing!

Eurobeat Intensifies
-Yes if you could handle the night drive and change your Soundtrack by yourself

Cons : 
-Awfull and stupid soundtrack, make you boring all time! Hope they added new soundtrack updates
-you essentially with rare chance to meet a cheater player that can use inifinite nitros lmao
-Took me 5 minutes or more to loading screen on first gameplay, and after switching between online mode to play solo mode"

Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Much rain, feels like home"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"The last Need For Speed I have owned was Most Wanted, and by far this is a major step up. Despite the decline seen throughout the recent releases of Need For Speed, I think NFS: Heat definitely takes back the series. The graphics are stunning for such a large map, and the game runs at a smooth frame rate throughout. With a 1050Ti I get around 70FPS in almost every place on the map.

This game is full of things to do, including Drift Zones, Speed Traps, and of course a ton of races to compete in and make money and/or reputation. Speaking of which, NFS: Heat has a unique concept I have not seen anywhere else. Splitting your game play in two with Day and Night as separate modes is incredible. At night, earn reputation and risk getting in trouble with the cops, and in the day earn cash to upgrade or buy new cars in official events. The game does force you to play both, and I think this game will keep me entertained for quite some time, since I haven't owned it for much at the time of review.

In addition to this, the game does a great job of encouraging online play. I love this new feature. Even though there has been online scoreboards in NFS before, it is definitely so much more exhilarating to jump into the map of Palm City with your friends and race them in real time. In addition to this, you get bonuses for racing against friends!

Overall, the game play is good. I have not completed the campaign as of yet, but the races are fantastic and customization is through the roof! (EA definitely did right by this game!). If you like Fora Horizon, give this a try. They are very similar and this is time well spent. Do try to get it on sale though!"

Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"It's NFS payback without the interesting mission's or the loot boxes. the Racing is fine.

Pro's: No Loot boxes
Con's: No Interesting Missions

Considering Payback is usually ~50% the price of this one, go for that if you haven't already.
Once upon a time this would have been an expansion pack. It's fine."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"This game is fun, good arcade racing. Even on Hard, the day races aren't that challenging, but the police will surely wreck you some times. My only real gripe with it is the soundtrack, with genres such as reggaeton and brazilian funk. What were they thinking when they licensed this musical garbage? Bring Rom Di Prisco back, please."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"I recommend buying this on sale first off. I went into this game expecting some PC friendly Forza cheese, but I went in and was genuinely impressed when I saw that this isn't another zoomer racing gaming targeted towards kids. First off, there is LOTS of car customization, even down to the exhaust sound, which by the way, is AMAZING. The sound design in this game is the absolute best out of any game I've played, at least for the cars. The soundtrack on the other hand, is awful. Absolute god awful rap and mexican pop music clog up the sound on my headphones, so the natural course of action is to completely mute the in-game music, and either listen to your own playlist, or listen to the beautiful custom and unique sound of your car. I'm a muscle car guy, so naturally the first car I bought was a 1970 Plymouth 'Cuda. The muscle cars in this game (unlike Forza and many other games) aren't actually outclassed. You can modify the stock 440cu (or any stock motor in any car) completely, upgrading the crank, adding an expensive ECU, you can even put forced induction systems on your cars such as turbochargers and the different types of superchargers. This means that you can use the stock motor in a muscle car and completely wipe the competition. Obviously you aren't going to gap the fastest and beefiest cars in the game, but that doesn't mean you can't catch up. Oh and the story is completely forgettable like all Need for Speed games. The gameplay and racing is amazing."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,I bought this game but it is not at all optimized. I only get 10-15 fps and note that I have a very powerful pc. The game lags even on low settings. NFS payback works smoothly on ULTRA but NFS Heat does'nt even run properly on lowest settings.
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,The most immersive rain simulation game ever
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Pretty good honestly. Nothing over the top, amazing or extra about it. So don't expect Forzo Horizon 4. But it's definitely a fun open world, arcade racer. Deluxe edition was cheaper than reggie game. I'd say it's worth it even if it is a couple bucks more just to have the EVO to start with. I haven't even looked at other cars since driving those. You get two of them for whatever reason; both with different wraps, rims, etc but same exact stats."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,Feels like old school Most Wanted + Underground mixed with NFS 2015. Amazing visual tuning and decent when it comes to performance tuning.
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"For someone who completely disliked the latest attempts to revive this series (2015 and Payback) due to awful handling and upgrade policies, this is AWESOME.

Seriously, it was the first time when I felt like I'm playing Carbon or Most Wanted (2005). The cars finally feel like they have some weight instead of gliding on the road. There is a very nice diversity in terms of events (sprint, circuit, drift, off-road) and each race type requires different configuration for the car. The parts can be purchased with money earned during the day, but you have to race during the night in order to gain Rep (Reputation) and unlock them. So far the upgrade part is very nicely done (no micro-transactions or something, like that).

The story is just average, but it's ok.

The only huge problem that I have is related to the music. It really sucks. It is painful to think that we went from Lil Jon, Snoop Dog, Rise Against, Unwritten Law to Latino trap/rap (or whatever this miserable genre is called).

EDIT: Had to mention Pendulum as well"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"[b]tl;dr:[/b] Mindless fun with the usual EA flaws. Music is rubbish but the core game is fun and reminds me of Need For Speed (2015)

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Classic NFS racing with loads of customisation options.
- UI is nice and clean, not too confusing
- Switching between Day/Night with the different race styles is a cool concept.
- Cops are actually difficult and pose a real risk to your efforts. It's not so easy now to keep all the benefits from night/day racing. Makes the game so much more fun and a proper challenge.
- Weather effects are excellent, but... (see below)
- Sound effects are excellent
- Customising all the things. All of them.

[h1]Mediocre:[/h1]
- Cutscences and story is the usual cringe with F&F style drama thrown in
- Developer has discovered what rain is and really wants you to know that they have discovered rain and that rain is wet, made of water, and it can rain. Also did you know that rain is a thing that can happen?
- Rain is everywhere
- Rain.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Soundtrack is extremely weak and the music controls are awful. Huge letdown for an NFS title.
- Game doesn't play well on PC if you're intending to use Dolby Vision (It starts to a black screen if I use it with my LG CX OLED with HDR enabled)
- Handling is a bit.. meh, but ONLY if compared to PC2, ACC for sims and FH4 for arcade style. Which.. you should fully expect. So it's not really a con, but still a little weak for an arcade

[h1]Don't get this game if:[/h1]
- You want wheel support
- Are a die-hard sim-racer and expect ""them physics""
- Expect anything other than a fun arcade racer that brings you back to 2005-esque NFS days. Take off the rose-tinted glasses and play the game from back then, it's not THAT good as you remember.

This isn't worth full retail price but it's definitely worth it on sale."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Although I only have 12 hours on record as of now, but it is safe to say that this game is really fun, and exciting to play. 
I see complaints out there saying that the road is super empty. Well, it might be a bit depressing if you are cruising, but if you are racing or speeding, trust me, you do not want any NPC vehicles in your way.
The graphics are really good, compared to some of the other racing games. The rain, oh the rain, makes it nicer, but it rains like 3/4 of the time
Night mode is really fun for me because of the heat level. The cops are super relentless, and will somehow catch up to you even if you are going at 300kph, but the adrenaline rush is there.
But honestly, I'm not sure if this is worth the original price, so I think only get this game if it's discounted :)"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,very fun if you like cars
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"I've played almost all the NFS games and this is, in my opinion, the best one yet. Voice acting is good, controls on keyboard are fine, and the visuals are amazing. BUT. THE. FUCKING. COPS! Holy shit are they dumb. There is almost 0 counter play to them and they are so fucking fast. Fix the cops and the game is near perfect in my opinion."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,ill eat your dog
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Umm, Yea ok so far it's good but I can see why people have gripes with this game. Still I am pleased to have a fun racing game that runs good despite making my comp work overtime.  Good graphics, the soundtrack is fine, I don't see why everyone is always trashing it, the controls on some cars can be janky and the heat system can be frustrating due to such monetary losses if you get caught.  I say if you can get it on sale it's worth it but absolutely not for 60."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,this game is awesome :)

SpeedRunners,Racing,207140,It's Good game too play with your friends and take them to challenging!!
SpeedRunners,Racing,207140,"O jogo é até bom, mas jogar sozinho ou com estranhos pode estragar bastante a experiência. Recomendaria ele apenas para jogar com amigos.

SpeedRunners está praticamente morto, então caso você queira jogar com outros jogadores e caso não entenda muito do jogo, você não vai gostar nem um pouco, já que os jogadores que ainda jogam são muito, MUITO bons... ou eu que sou muito ruim. Caso tenha amigos pra jogar, acaba sendo bem divertido, ainda assim não diria que esse é um jogo que eu jogaria por por muito tempo."
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"I gotta say, the main character is some sort of god in this. He can rebuild an entire engine in under an hour. He can slot in an entire exhaust system as if it's Lego. He can somehow remove the fuel pump without removing anything else on the car. He can determine the exact condition of a set of brake pads through the rims and caliper. Everything is an exact percentage to this man, not ""good"", ""worn"" or ""needs replacing"". Hell, he can replace a timing belt in a matter of seconds. I envy this man.
If you like playing as god, and like working on cars without doing the tedious stuff (or working on literally any French car), then this is the game for you.

In all seriousness, this game helps you learn a lot about the different parts of cars and what they do. I'm no mechanic, I just got a lot of experience on repairing my own cars because they've either been French or just old run down junkboxes on wheels. But this is enjoyable. It's satisfying refurbishing cars, and rebuilding engines. Obviously, it doesn't cover absolutely every aspect. But it will probably give you a much better idea of what the mechanic's telling you when you ever have to take your own car into a garage irl, instead of going ""Oh yeah, oh ok, yeah replace whatever tf that is please"".

Great game to pass the time, and also learn a bit about cars on the side.
9/10 - Only a couple of crash bugs going into barns, but otherwise a neat game."
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"I usually wait until I beat a game to write a review for it, but this is not exactly a game that one ""beats"" in the traditional sense. CMS2018 is exactly what it says it is: You take the role of yourself, starting with a small humble garage with a single car lift, and just about $4,000 to your name. It takes me back to my youth of Snap-Ons Gearhead Garage (http://www.gearheadgarage.com/).

I grabbed this on a sale and I think I paid around $10 for it, and it's worth every penny. The game is really separated into a few smaller meta-games.

On one hand, you've got your phone orders; these are customers that need help with their cars. Obviously as the game starts off you do things like perform basic brake service, changing oil and filters, and very minor improvements. On the other hand; you've got complete car restorations. I mean sex is great and all, but have you bought an old rusted 1962 AC Cobra from an old barn and restored it to 100% of it's former glory with a complete rebuild and then turned around and sold it for a tidy $80K profit?

As you complete jobs, you earn experience and you level up, which provides you with talent points you can use to do things like move faster, unscrew things quicker, and even expand your garage. The expansion of the garage is the most satisfying thing as it often results in unlocking other great features, like the engine pulling crane, the battery charger, and eventually the interior detail shop or the body shop/paint shop.

I have only put about 23 hours into CMS2018 and I feel satisfied with my purchase. The game is enjoyable. It's a zen garden but with bolts and rust instead of plants. It's a fun way to wind down after a stressful day at work.

I will admit, the game is not without it's flaws: The music is terrifyingly bad (in my own opinion) and there is some strange UI lag from time to time. There is also an unreasonable painful grind to get to level 30 (the level in which you unlock the body and paint shop). I often found myself finishing every single order I could as quickly I as I could, regardless of what the customer wanted - even if it meant doing the most bare minimum, JUST to get the XP.

But even with the minor faults, the game is fun and worth the cost. Go out there and fix up some cars!"
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"Love this game, cant wait for CMS 21 to drop!!!!!"
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"Great game to understand the inner workings of a car. Though I doubt it's an EXACT simulation of how things would work irl (quite fairly so), it's great fun for those who'd enjoy tearing down a car and putting it back together"
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"If your into cars, this game is for you. It's mechanics is very realistic when it comes to building, repairing or modifying a car. Very fun and relaxing, you also learn a lot from the parts when playing the game. Highly Recommend!"
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"its supper fun and the mods are very good aswel its one of the most relaxing games ive ever played, some mods require a dlc or 2 so just check"
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"whatever you do, do not download mustang mods"

Bad Driving controls
kinda reallistic
360/69"
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"This game is really amazing. I did not know a whole lot about cars when I started this game but I wanted to learn more. I am a 15 year old and I've learned so much from this game, obviously you won't be an expert after playing this game but you learn a lot about the parts in a car and how they work together. If you are not really into cars this might not be the game for you but I think you can still enjoy it without being into cars. the game may feel repetitive some times in the first part of the game, you don't have much money and you only really work on brakes. Once you unlock the junkyard and have more money to work with having project cars is a lot of fun. The sandbox mode is pretty fun but I do find it a little boring after awhile, the story mode makes building cars a lot more fun with having to manage your money. The workshop is also so cool and fun to bring your favorite cars into the game! Overall a really fun game for beginners or experts."
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,Very funn easy to understand and thats coming from a dumbass
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"Very addicting! I enjoy it, I love that this game is modable because it makes difference. Already rebuild some nice cars, I love the engine swap option for some of the cars. You can turn stock car into drag beast or race car."
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"its a good game
"
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,Do not buy really buggy.
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,It's fun but I've found that it takes a lot of time to do a complete rebuild on a car.
Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,can build them cars. workshop is nice too.
art of rally,Sports,550320,"I've been playing since around 1.10 and the game has only gotten better and better the more I play. The achievements and car unlocks are fun and challenging, and flow well with the main campaign. This is my first ever racing game and I found myself having fun through every stage of progression, from learning how to maintain a drift, to mastering trail-braking, it's rewarding every step of the way. Only at 200+ hours am I running out of things to do in game, but (at the time of writing) luckily the Kenya Update is soon around the corner. I joined the Funselektor Discord soon after purchase, and the community has been incredible. From beginning tips, optimal setting adjustments, and sharing custom liveries, the community surrounding this game has helped tremendously. I seriously can't recommend this game enough, 10/10 experience all the way through."
art of rally,Sports,550320,"The driving is hard to get the hang of at first, but it's fun to learn and improve. All the cars handle differently adding more depth to the driving, as well a different road surfaces and weather effects.
Overall a casual, fun game that presents enough challenge to be engaging, but not too much that it's frustrating to learn and play. The music is also great.

8/10"
art of rally,Sports,550320,"It's the essence of the DIRT rally series but without all the fat. 

This is rally as raw as it gets. Primary focus is driving physics. What matters most is the connection you build to the car that feels best to you. From that point on it's a journey. You master different szenarios with slowly increasing in difficulties (track layout, track material, weather). Progression comes as your skill increases. Once you mastered the ""basics"" you will do it again – but faster this time. Faster means more powerful cars and stronger opponents. At this point let me say this game is not casual and not for everyone. You need that certain mindest to put yourself through it. But if you have that mindset and you like cars: do not hesitate. Just buy it. It's worth it."
art of rally,Sports,550320,"Amazing arcade!

9.98 of 10:
- 0.01 for weird collision system
- 0.01 for weird rain physic

PS: I wait for Kenia SO MUCH"
art of rally,Sports,550320,"A top down rally game like nothing else on the market at the moment. The graphics are very bright and colourful, the maps are well made and have plenty of variety in the straights,jumps,corners,camber,uphill and downhill sections. The game never gets boring plenty of content and cars to unlock in career mode.Plenty of other mode;s to mess around in too. Highly recommended game with hours and hours of game play."
art of rally,Sports,550320,"Simple and relaxing driving game for everybody. Cheap, fun, replayable. Enough cars to satisfy every classic era rally car enjoyer.  What's not to like?"
art of rally,Sports,550320,"A top-down rally game that's both soothing and exciting. The soundtrack and visual style compliment each other well, not to mention the well made physics."
art of rally,Sports,550320,"Bought this game on a whim, just because how it looked and was not disappointed.
Now, I'm not really a racing fan having only played one or two older Need for Speed games - so I can't speak from the point of view of someone who knows a lot about racing games. And I won't.
Instead I'll review this from the point of view of someone who wanted a simple racing game to play once in a while. And I can say that I got what I wanted.

What I liked:
- looks really good. I like this type of minimalist low poly look and I think it works well with how minimalist the gameplay is
- simple gameplay. Pick a game mode, pick a car and drive. Nothing is distracting you from the actual core of the game - driving.
- realistic. Or what I imagine driving in real life is like. Every car feels different, every type of terrain feels different and it took me some time to learn how not to fly off the road on every turn. (Small tip: set transmission to manual in settings. Doing this gave me more control and made driving easier)
- music. I wouldn't listen to this OST on it's own, but it works really well with the game

What I think could've been better:
- my results info. When you finish a race you are given info like (5410 | 50%). Maybe it's just me but it's not clear what these numbers actually mean. I wish there was a tooltip or something with explanation for this
- map in free roam. When in free roam and looking for collectables I end up pressing Esc way too often and it breaks the immersion. I think it would be great if there was a setting to display a map in free roam mode.

To conclude, I think this game is great for someone who wants a pretty game to just drive and not be distracted by irrelevant tuning, carrer or other mechanics"
art of rally,Sports,550320,"This Game is just a Loveletter to Car-Enthusiasts.

-It looks beautiful
-its really fun and authentic to drive
-most of the cars sound good.  i dont like some of them, but i also really love a few of them.
-the soundtrack is great

-the only bad thing i could say about art of rally is the highest difficulty. it could be a bit more punishing for my taste.
there are leaderboards though, if you really want to push yourself.

"
art of rally,Sports,550320,"I like a lot of things about this game. Art style, rally lore, unlocks and events, sound and atmosphere are all really nice. I really wish there were more camera options though as you aren't able to have as much precise control over your vehicle with the available options. There's also a lot of pop-in in the environment, especially in the outlying vegetation which to me was distracting. If I could I would definitely rate this game ""neutral"" but I can't so I'm going with ""No"" seeing as I'm a pretty average gamer and I really did't enjoy the actual game play so much as I enjoyed the idea of the game. I definitely wouldn't say this isn't a good game but at the end of the day it wasn't for me."
Retrowave,Racing,1239690,"Great game! But... I tried to do this in real life and now I have to go to jail for vehicular manslaughter? Someone please explain, I did nothing wrong! I was just doing this game in real life..."

Redout: Enhanced Edition,Racing,517710,Reminds me of Extreme G Racing for the Playstation 2.
Horizon Chase Turbo,Racing,389140,"If you want some casual racing game to kill the time or if you remember the old games like TopGear, this might very well be what you want.

Horizon Chase Turbo is a very simple racing game. There's no worries with ideal racing line or tyre wear, you just plant your foot on the gas and go ahead, dodging the incoming cars. While you do it, you can also grab medals on the track, that at the end of the race, add up to your score. With enough score you unlock the next races and more cars for you to choose from.

It's a cool little game but not without its flaws. One of which is there's a upgrade system in the game, which is welcome sure, but it's implement in the weirdest way possible. As you get your score higher, you unlock races to run for those upgrades, once you win the race you'll have a small selection to choose from, but after you choose one upgrade that is added to all your cars. So sure, more grip to go faster on the turns is always nice, but i would like for my gripy cars to have some top speed instead.

Also, if you remember the original TopGear on the SNES, you might remember that game had pitstops, because each car would use fuel at a different rate, so the slowest car could very well win by simply not stopping or making a splash&go. No such a thing in this game tho, which is not a deal breaker, but something that it's odd to not have when the game lift so much of its gameplay from the TopGear games.

Music is also something very much close to the soundtrack of TopGear, specially the first game, with some songs almost identical but slightly changed for copyright reasons, i'm sure.

Overall, it's a great little game that doesn't take it self seriously and it's just fine for when you don't want to take it seriously too."
Horizon Chase Turbo,Racing,389140,"Underrated, nice and chill game with a really cool style. Even if your not much of a racing game fan, I would still say you can have some fun with this one as a comfort-game or whatever.

And the soundtrack slaps. Really sets the mood!"
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"I would recommend only because I have some fun moments with it, but to be honest, the awful physics, the many times that you will lose just because a branch of a tree just get in the way of your visual and the lack of consistency on to give the idea to where you could or couldnt go, its frustrating. And to make it worse, if you play the levels on the dailies you will find that they dont work well, IDk how to explain it those levels doesnt feel right! they feel so broken than many times you would quit them just out of rage ."
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"I know I am writing this review far too late, but this is one of my favorite games in the last 5 years.
I enjoyed every inch of the game and became really obsessive about it.
I also started RL Mountainbiking partially because of this.
Thanks for this experience and all the challenges"
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"This is the perfect game for me. If you want a game you can play if you want to wind down or do something on the side while watching a video, this game is for you. If you want a game that continuously challenges you, without feeling grindy or tedious, this is the game for you. If you want a game that never frustrates you even through the challenge, this game is for you.

It's a simple concept executed through simple design, but executed flawlessly 10/10"
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"This is a little gem. It's a racing game but also one about discovery and relaxation.
The ambiance is great."
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"It's fun and pretty but incredibly buggy and inconsistent especially relating to crashing. Kinda weird checkpoint spots too, terrain being polygons definitely inhibits gameplay.

bump into a tree at 2mph: blood everywhere
fall down a 100ft drop onto rock: totally fine and safe
fall down a 50 ft drop onto rock: no now ur dead haha fuck you"
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"Elegantly simple, yet satisfyingly complex. From casual and scenic to dangerous and unforgiving, this game has an immense lure that will keep you hooked for hours at a time. A healthy speedrun community and a very friendly development team manage to bring vibes of a multiplayer experience to an otherwise singleplayer game."
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"very fun, and reasonably realistic"
Inertial Drift,Racing,1184480,"Incredibly interesting driving mechanics. The way every car handles entirely differently gives you a large amount of content to actually explore. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes slick semi-arcadey driving, and/or Initial D fans!"
Inertial Drift,Racing,1184480,Definitely Fun! I was one of the first round of purchased players because the trailer/preview gave me those classic arcade style Initial D vibes :) I feel like it can be somewhat repetitive but given that its a racing game that makes sense. I do like the twin stick drifting idea but in practice it has some drawbacks this making this more of an Arcade Racer than anything else. But for some quick and dirty fun its perfect.
Inertial Drift,Racing,1184480,Fantastic driving/drifting game. Would recommend to play on a controller. Would like if the online and friends features in the game were more current and easier to navigate.
Motorsport Manager,Sports,415200,"I can't really stand to watch car racing, but this game is absolutely addictive and fun. It took a little while to figure out how everything works, and several restarts. There are lots of YouTube videos and other resources online to learn the game through. I'm now enjoying moving up the ranks with my custom team. Lots of fun yet to experience and I already have 334 hours in the game! I really enjoy the strategy of both building up your team/cars and managing the races. Even though this isn't a recent release, it's much better than many of the games out these days. I highly recommend this game if you are into strategy/managing type games."
Motorsport Manager,Sports,415200,"Choose your drivers, your crew, your teams

F1® 2019,Sports,928600,"Game has a serious problem with crashing, to this  date it has never been able to shut down properly. These kind of crashes don't bother me but every 3-4 gaming sessions it crashes randomly while driving

Trackmania United Forever,Racing,7200,c:
Trackmania United Forever,Racing,7200,lots of fun to compete against yourself. I've found myself turning to this game more often than some of the more modern titles in my library due to just how enjoyable it is
Trackmania United Forever,Racing,7200, e
Trackmania United Forever,Racing,7200,"Easily the best Trackmania game out there. While trying to get friends to play the game is hard, the Singleplayer campaign tracks are pretty fun, in fact that's the most competitive part of the community. People are always fighting for the world record on every track. It's insane.

This is the paid version. You can play 6 other environments if you don't enjoy Stadium. There's also a different campaign that includes all those environments, plus 4 modes. Race, Platform, Stunts and Puzzle.
Race: Complete the track within a time limit to earn a medal.
Platform: Complete the track with the least amount of respawns.
Stunts: Earn points from performing stunts to earn a medal.
Puzzle: Finish the track in the Track Editor with a limited amount of blocks, then complete the track within a time limit to earn a medal.

There's also Star Tracks which were from a competition held by Nadeo on the TM-Exchange website.
If you wanted to create a Trackmania campaign, you can with My Campaign. You can create tracks for flag series in the 4 United modes at your free will.

If Singleplayer isn't your taste, there is also Multiplayer. Online has several gamemodes.
Time Attack: Like Singleplayer, compete for the fastest time.
Rounds: Get the highest amount of points in several rounds on the same map. Pressing your Give Up button will set you as DNF and you spectate for the rest of the round.
Team Rounds: Same as regular Rounds, but with teams. Basically Trackmania 2020's ranked mode.
Laps: Compete in a standard multi-lap track without resetting your time. Literally every racing game ever.
Cup: Compete a series of several race maps. Get the highest amount of points to win.
Stunts: Only for United players, get the highest points without resetting to win.
If you buy Trackmania United Forever, you will have no restrictions on the amount of races you play before spectating the 5th track. This is called FreeZone.
Other players can see your custom skins, unlike Nations Forever.

You can download skins and tracks in ManiaLink with coppers. You can get coppers by booting up the game daily or by entering player keys."
Distance,Racing,233610,"Visually stunning, great with music, and fantastic performance in VR. I always find myself coming back to Distance when I just want to get lost on the road in a different dimension."
Distance,Racing,233610,"Great Game, EXTREMELY Hard, yet EXTREMELY Fair. The Mess ups feel like they're your fault, and the Skill Ceiling is one of the highest I've ever seen. Definitely one of the hardest games I've ever played."
Distance,Racing,233610,definitely worth your money. Even if you only play through it once.
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"Remember playing it 7-8 years ago,was awesome.Now game is pretty dead,and they did a Freezone...I would totally recommend it,if not Freezone.That means you can play 5 tracks,and you MUST spectate one race.And if you want to upgrade to unlimited version you must pay 20-30 euro for a game that is dying and is 9 years old.Well if it would be 5 euro,I dont mind to pay,but 30 euro on steam is WAY to much.Still with friends its fun.Try it,maybe you will like it."
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"I've logged somewhere close to 1000 hours on this before finding it on steam. The online community is hit or miss, but the single player campaign is fantastic. Get a couple of friends, and get ready to fight for that last .001 of a second so you can win. Stupid physics, stupid speeds, fucking amazing fun levels."
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"im mostly doing this coz of the background music..... but seriously, this game is very addictive. gameplay is very well done, and man the background music is good. Original price for the complete pack is a little over the top imo, but if you do have that much to spare, go for it. I wouldn't regret it ."
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,this game is good and the type of game is a race. Can ride on all kinds of fertilizers and other developed or their routes. Can create their machines and map. And a good game.
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,TrakMania Nations Forever is a very salty game with much salt
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"This is one of the best games i ever played especially when i was young... Free to Play and Free to Win, you cant get bored of this game when you have UNLIMITED TRACKS , the race editor is a genius idea if you are creative and have imagination.
The only bad thing is that you have to wait an entire race in multiplayer as a spectator to continue playing but it is not a problem for me.
I really recommend this game for thoose who loves f2p racing games with stunts..."
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,wicked fast!!!!!!!!!!!! want speed? This games for you!
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"Some limitations with the free acount, but there is a lot of customizability with the car appearance wise (not model-wise). If you want a realistic racing experience, this is not it. If you want a wacky arcade racer, then this is one of the best. It still has a lot of servers running. There are a lot of cool puzzle racing maps people have made. You can have massive races. Also theres a more traditional single player. Cheers to TrackMania."
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,nawet fajne
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,Really cool game needs improvement tho!
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,This game is good.
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"Let me get this straight, the game itself isn't bad, it's the online that really bugs me. You have to spectate one in every five games unless you pay £20. You can't play with friends either. Or go on certain servers.

It's so restricted that it's probably worth paying a fiver or so and getting trackmania 2 stadium or canyon as you will be able to play without the annoying restrictions.

It says in the game description that it's a 'truly free to play game'. It just isn't."
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"It is the absolute best free to play racing game.
Not only does it have many levels which are outrageous
it also has a level editor which allows you to make your own tracks 
the level editting is very simple and great.

I've gotten back in to this game and it's time to make some stuff. So I'd created a benchmark course for people using Fraps to benchmark (which idk why the game has a built in tool for that) and a new account. It has been great playing this game after a few minutes. You will, and I am meaning this, NEVER LEAVE THIS GAME. If you somewhat have a potato that can not run this game, get a PC with at least 1GB VRAM"

I remembered playing trackamania demos that came on demo discs inside magazines but to play a free version was for a kid the most amazing thing ever. Only one type of car in this game, but it's fine because it's free and it doesn't have microtransactions. it's fun to try out."
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,AMAZING!
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,I play this game at WC...is cool
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,Yet one of the best free racing game. I recommend buy TrackMania United to get full experience.
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"If you already own Trackmania United, playing this game is kinda pointless. Other than that, ESWC was better, but that version was around before ubisoft took over the franchise. But as for this version of Nations, it's good as a demo before buying United."

Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"You have little to no idea what you're missing out on until you actually purchase and play Stardew Valley for yourselves.  It is one of the most fantastic, relaxing, open world gameplay experiences you will ever play in your life.  And one wouldn't know that by simply looking at the games graphics alone.  Stardew Valley is how a game should be made!"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"Married the town alcoholic, it was the happiest marriage in all my gameplay attempts. 10/10 love u shane"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"i play this game with my friend ricky who i am deeply in love with. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is also in love with their best friend and wants to start a farm with them, adopt a cat & sleep in the same bed as them. 
the only downside is that i now have crippling attachment issues. i dont know. maybe i always had those."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"There are not enough words to describe how fantastic this game is.
Just want to farm? Sure!
Want to fight monsters and mine rocks? Great!
Want to hang out with the townspeople and fall in love? Yes!
Want to go fishing? By all means!
Like to explore and forage? Excellent!
This game is easy to learn and will keep you busy for hours. There are so many things to do and you can relax and take your time. The music is beautiful - most games I usually turn music down or mute it but not this game. NPC's are interesting and all have their own stories.
The game price is excellent value and all extra content has been free. And the amount of content in this game is staggering. The developer really cares about his game and fans which is really nice.

This is easily one of my favorite games of all time. I definitely recommend it - to everybody!"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,I feel that 950 hours played speaks for itself.
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"I played this game with my girlfriend and my 2 side chicks. We all had a great time during the game, but halfway through playing it my girlfriend started questioning me about where these 2 other girls came from. I told her there was nothing going on between me and the 2 other girls and that they are just here to play the game with us because they are also my friends. Thinking that my girlfriend would be satisfied with the answer, I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that I can keep playing this game with my girlfriend and my 2 side chicks. But I thought wrong, my girlfriend proceeded to fence me in my house and when I confronted her about why, she said that there is no space on our farm for cheating men. Thanks to this game, I'm pretty sure my girlfriend now loves me even more and I also love her even more. Our relationship levels definitely have increased, and my side chicks are now best friends with my girlfriend too. I wonder why they never invite me to go out with them anymore though..."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"I have this game on my Laptop, Switch, and Phone and still I am not bored of it. It is an amazing game that I love so much and everytime you play through it, you can play it differently. Whether it's the partner you choose, the farm you decide to start on, or if you rather focus on fishing or mining. 10/10 for me. A great casual game to play that's easy on any device."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,my comfort video game <3
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"A phenomenal game, great for hours upon hours of fun, alone or with friends. A great soundtrack with charming graphics and characters. Let's get farming!"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"My favorite thing about Stardew Valley is not just that there’s a lot to see and do, but that it’s (almost) all intertwined. It’s not apparent at first — when I started my farm, I planned each tile for maximum efficiency and reset when I accidentally bought the wrong seeds. But the secret of the Valley is that it’s much more than making each day productive on the farm alone. As I ventured off my plot of 16-bit land and started to explore, I began to really enjoy the days for everything they are — and how its parts fit together to build a captivating rural life.

Each day in Stardew Valley takes around 10 to 20 real minutes, and several of them are occupied by the slow business of starting a farm from scratch. Having to plant the right seeds, water your crops, and wait for the harvest before making any real money means there’s not a lot to do right away. Fitting, since my character had just left a stifling job at the Joja Corporation — Stardew Valley’s ever-present reminder that capitalism can grow soulless — for a simpler life on grandpa’s old farm. But Stardew Valley isn’t simple. It’s relaxed, sure, and lets you grow at your own pace, but it’s a rich world once you get past the slow first season.

From Humble Beginnings

Life in Stardew Valley’s Pelican Town picked up for me around summer of the first year — by then I’d gained access to fishing, exploring the mines, and enough money to start investing in livestock. Things really started to come together, and that initial simplicity evolved into a quiet sort of busyness. I grew crops so that I could prepare the best food, which I could in turn give as gifts to win over the townsfolk or to take down with me into the mine to restore my health as I fought monsters to get resources, which I could use to build a useful item back on my farm. I then used ore from the mines to upgrade my tools so I could chop up a log and get to a secret part of the Valley, and all that work helped me level up so I could craft even better items. The blend of RPG and farm sim feels effortless, and it makes Stardew Valley exciting and compelling without being stressful.

Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"Such a quaint, charming little game. A perfect time waster with surprisingly immersive writing that makes you genuinely care about your fellow townsfolk. I picked this up late December of 2020, deep into quarantine, and didn’t put it back down until I had done essentially every possible thing the game offered. It’s addicting, satisfyingly repetitive (if that makes any sense), with a laundry list of fun game mechanics and mini games outside of the game’s main farming aspect."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,YAS just so yasss
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"For the first 2 days of playing this, I was really on the fence as I've never really enjoyed these type of games. But before I knew it, the world had sucked me in and today without even noticing it, I've been playing for 8 hours when it felt like 2.

The progression systems in place are so vast and deep but it's not overwhelming as the player can choose which systems to focus and progress on at any time. Each NPC has their own likes, dislikes, schedules and dreams and you instantly form your own natural opinion of them after a few interactions with each one. I've only scratched the surface with this game but I can already tell that this game is a gem that allows you to forget about all your worries in life and just manage your farm with your waifu by your side. 10/10 :)"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"If you don't like Stardew Valley, you may want to see a doctor."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,VERY FUN AND CHILL GAME. REALLY NICE WHEN PLAYING WITH SOMEONE :D
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,BEST GAME EVEEEEEEEEEER
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Its fun but I wish I could play multiplayer with my friend who is on a MAC. Please fix the bug
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,very good game if you like good games
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Leah'ı bulamıyorum
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"very good game, relaxing and calm vibe.
Need more games like this in a fast paced world in today's day and age"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Incredibly heartwarming game that I owned on the switch before owning it on PC. Can't wait to spend many hours in it on PC. Also has one the slappiest soundtracks of any game out there.
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"it slaps, love me some farmin with the boys"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Incredibly addictive if you love farming games!
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,farm game make brain produce serotonin

Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Only one word can describe this game - addictive.
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,My life potato
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Great way to spend a hundred hours.
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"This is the game to relieve stress, if you want to have relaxed and fun time, play this game, you should play it over and over again, it never stops being fun."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,fun game thanks for the pop up steam I liked it
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"I don't usually leave real reviews on games but Stardew is one of the best games I've played in a long time. The music is always fitting with the atmosphere and its conducted so well into the game, and the NPCs are all likable in their own ways. The several different professions in the game are always a refresher and they're all balanced. Farming isn't always everything either, fishing for a day can lead to an easy $2000 or more. Stardew is an amazing game and its fully worth the pick up."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"It's fun, but 16GB of ram is recommended so that you can constantly have 500+ wiki tabs active for you to search in the game"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,I have over 450 hour logged on steam in addition to hundreds of hours on xbox

Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Literalmente podes tener waifus y husbando por montones.
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Good sh*t
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"this game is quite possibly one of the coziest and most heartwarming experiences you will ever have with a game. second playthrough right now on pc with hundreds of hours on switch, and im enjoying every single minute i play of this game. cannot recommend it enough"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Abigail make me go goo goo gaga
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"I spent the entire day playing Harvest Moon: Back to Nature during my early teenage years, and it ruined my studies.

Now I'm ruining my productivity with this.

10/10 would get addicted to crop watering again"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,I can't stop playing I absolutely love this. Pandemic who? Everything's fine on my little farm :)
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Very nice textures and sprites which can ease the mind. Expect several hours of gameplay
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"I discovered Stardew Valley way back when it was released on Steam, and initially I actually
had a pirated copy of the game so that I could try it out.

After I had played it for a couple of hours however, I realised that this game is an absolute masterpiece of an experience. I bought it immediately, while also gifting it to several friends over the next years.

I love how it lets me have my own little place to relax, creating my own farm just the way I see fit and overall just makes me very happy. 
The creator of this game, Eric Barone is a person I look up to very much - both as a game-developer and as a cool person. You have probably made one of the best games of this decade, and I don't even say that lightly. 

If you haven't already, I highly recommend you to try this game out. There is a reason basically all reviews are 'Overwhelmingly positive', and I bet that's what you're going to see if you look at the ratings at any point in time. 
This is what a game is supposed to be like."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,good for e-daters..
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"iz good, the farming is pretty good, and you really need to ten to your live stock and crops. I hink yoou might like this game because it has a lot of adventure, people, and story"

Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"BEST GAME EVER. I like it because i'm usually bored all day, but after i got Stardew valley i'm almost never bored! Also a good game if u have bad computer. I also love how u can marry the same gender as yourself. So i would rly recommend that you buy this game! :D"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"One of the best games of the genre, an amazing experience."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"It's one of the legendary games you must buy. Why you must buy it, you ask. I thought it's gonna be super boring and not fun, but this game is a masterpiece. I was always playing games where you need to kill things watch your step and stuff. Everytime i get tired of shooter games i hop on Stardew Valley and relax. What does this game offer?
Chopping down trees,
Mining,
Making a farm and farming,
Talking and making friends with npcs,
Fishing,
And much more. There are so many things to discover for me."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"You have no idea what you're missing out on until you buy this game. Trust me.

I gained 60 hours in the first week of buying this game. I constantly have like 20 tabs open to search things up on the Stardew Valley wiki. I have sold my soul to Pierrie and preserving blueberries.

Help."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Its great fun and keeps you busy
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Want to relax and have fun? Buy this game if you haven't and are thinking about it still. This is a sign. :)

Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,i have sacrificed many children to the upper gods
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"A beautiful time waster, a contemplative and meditative experience with enough action and progression to make it interesting for hours upon hours."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"Stardew Valley is amazing. One of my all time favourites, as someone who loves slice of life games, interacting with the community really does it for me. The farming and fishing aspects are almost meticulously calming and I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a relaxing interactive game <3"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"feed animal, water crop, very cool."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"Usually games of this genre don't interest me, but this game is an exception."

Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,you can make coffee. I like coffee. 10/10
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"I love this game.  I spend 80% of my time on steam looking for another game exactly like this, but with better graphics and more flowers and magic."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"Very detailed game play, but an overall relaxing low key experiance.  Can lose whole weeks to this game if you aren't careful, it rather sneaks up on you. definate recommendation"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,Beautifully addicting game. Starts off slow in the beginning but once you hit summer you wont be able to stop. CHECK THE WIKI! It helps so much cause a lot of things are confusing at first. Be ready to spend hours on your farm and gifting random things to towns people. :)
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"A masterpiece in almost every aspect.

- Escape a crumbling treasure vault to the ramblings of an old man.
- Aid the remnants of a fascist, paramilitary organization.
- Aid a whole charity, humanitarian organization.
- Help a face on a TV screen achieve regional domination.
- Hit said face with a 9 iron in the name of a bear or a bull.
- Destroy a robot dog created by some robot scientist with your... I can't say, sorry. They're on your hands and feet, that's all I am allowed to tell you.
- Self-destruct a bunker because you wanted to put them all on crosses but couldn't so you went with the next best option.
- Stray away from the road towards a crashed retro-futuristic helicopter and almost wish for a nuclear winter.
- Learn to use endgame armor only to realize you're still not invincible to living science experiments; the hard way.
- Let a monorail get destroyed because of your loose lips.
- Take advantage of someone else's loose lips in order to take over Vegas.
- Jury-rig a few heaps of electric parts to a heap of metal to create the hands-down best companion you will ever meet.
- Cement ""the Butcher"" to Ulysses S. Grant's reputation for eternity, albeit with a different surname.
- Watch a team of pseudo-adventurers get massacred by a giant scorpion in a firehouse.
- Watch a group of ghouls re-enact Jonestown... by accident. I think.
- Get paid for having someone else's hat.
- Get paid for collecting special caps.
- Demand better payment for collecting said caps.
- Get paid for doing your job.
- Forget you had a job by taking another.
- Destroy everything with nothin' but a hound dog. This one won't make you feel so blue.
- Destroy entire families and factions.
- Turn on the radio because the vault was getting too scary.
- Turn it back off for the immersion.
- Persuade away your problems, shoot them, punch through them, let them sizzle out, fake them out. Or forget about them.

I think you get the idea. Beyond the crashing, pitiful combat, and quest bugs that are funny yet annoying, is still quite a gem of PC gaming. The ways you can play this game, and still have fun, are nearly endless. And each of those times, you'll find a couple of details you glossed over in the previous playthrough. Now that's a sign of a great piece of media right there. Helps me to... turn a blind eye to its crashaholic tendencies.

So come on, what are you waiting for? Can't expect God to do all the work, now can we?"
Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,the quests and story are very good. There are multiple ways to go about resolving pretty much any situation. The game does benefit greatly from quality of life mods but you will still have a great time with the vanilla game!

Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,"People say this is the best Fallout game ever made, to be honest before this game i only finished Fallout 4 and i really enjoyed it, I'm not a stranger to Bethesda games, Skyrim is my favorite game of all games, i really loved Oblivion and Dishonored, and now the time has come, this is the time to play Fallout New Vegas. 
First of all i have to admit that i was really bored at the beginning, it was really slow, but then when you start to discover you can't stop.  For me, main quests were really well written, side quests were amazing, and the roleplaying was just ""wow"", you can feel the effect your choices make and sometimes they are really critical, the end of the game is completely created by your decisions. If you are going to buy this game you have to buy with DLC's. I played the DLC's with this order:
first i became 25 lvl then i played Dead Money DLC, then i became like 30-35 lvl and played Honest Hearts DLC, then Old World Blues and then before the last quest of the game i've played Lonesome Road, you can play this with this order, they are really brilliant, mysterious, well written, sometimes scary and dark, and enjoyable.

It's simply amazing how much detail they put into this game. The game world might be smaller than in Fallout 3, but it feels more alive and exploring is so worth it, since it's likely you stumple upon something or someone of interest. Many different perks allow for different playstyles. Be it melee or range centered. Last but not least, the storytelling is great and some of the newer AAA games can learn quite a bit from it."

I've never played Fallout game before. But then, I wanted to give Fallout a try. But I have heard that Fallout New Vegas is the best in Fallout series! So I gie it a shot. The first I being presented with introduction of the story in this game it was nice to experience detailed story and the lore of it. Introduction in this game is realy matters, because you can know what happen through this game. So far, it's been quite a journey though. I liked the story and it has choices that entirely up to you to shape it's story. Oh I've found so many unique items here like sniper named ""Ratslayer"". It's unique weapon with silencer and a scope attached on it. It help me a lot, i think i like enganging enemies from afar, if the enemies got too close to me, i usualy use 10mm pistol or Riot shotgun to take them out. Riot shotgun is great weapon too! you should get them both if you want to engage enemies from far and close range! I mostly now hunting some unique weapons and armors. It's quite a struggle but it's worth it. Make my most journey easier if I encounter some enemies! That's it. I told you a lot already. So why don't you take this journey now? It'll be worth it if you want it to."

Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,"Fallout: New Vegas has ruined all other games for me. I have never been presented with so much player choice and so many nuanced moral choices in a videogame.

The story is solid. Even side characters are given depth. Side quests always tease your expectations. And for a game with robot cowboys and post-apocalyptic Elvis impersonators, everything feels grounded. NPCs accurately know surrounding landmarks and events. People comment on events that happen (and things you cause to happen), and seemingly nothing you do is off limits. No characters are invincible because they are too important for the plot (not even companions if you play in survival mode).

This game may be a decade old, but it still feels fresh. It truly offers a fun and engaging world with stakes you become invested in.

Buy this game and prepare to get ""Big Iron"" and ""Heartache by the Numbers"" stuck in your head. This game's ring-a-ding!"

Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of 24
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and 19 more
One and 19 more

Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
20 men had tried to take him, 20 men had made a slip
21 would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was 20 past 11 when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

There was 40 feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip"

Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"One of the best RPG's I've ever played. It most definitely has its flaws but the challenge you can get from this game is absolutely mint. 
Some things to note before buying this game 

1) It's armor system is unlike most other games. It blocks status effects and crowd control until it is removed then they can be applied (a couple of feats you can pick up can bypass this on enemies but that's the exception not the norm)

2) If you're playing through this game for the first time, don't feel bad if you can't play it at the highest difficulty. It's not meant for a first time playthrough but to challenge experienced players on subsequent ones with more enemies, more intelligent enemy AI and (of course) stronger enemies as well.

3) When building your party composition, it's better to do all 4 magical, all four physical, or two and two. I do not recommend you go with one person solely as one thing and the other three as another as that one person all by themselves will not be contributing much to fights.

4) There is no ""tank"" in this game. That sort of role doesn't exist. There are also no traditional classes, optimizing for certain builds is of course a thing (and for harder difficulties almost mandatory) but the sky is the limit with your imagination so long as you play within the confines of the system

Hope you enjoy the game, feel free to hit me up if you're new and would like someone to play with. Game plays just fine solo as well but games are always more fun with others. =)"
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"I started this game during COVID in August 2020, when a couple friends suggested that it’s like a tabletop RPG (“TTRPG”) and might be fun to play together weekly. I couldn’t get into it at first, mostly due to distraction, but once we got a good third of the way through the first act, I was intrigued. I then became more hooked each session and by the fifth or so, I was loving the game and actively looking forward to our game nights. Once we were halfway, I started a solo save to catch up to where we were, more thoroughly following the story on my own. It took us about 6 months to finish the game, but we never missed a week of playing in all that time and I completed my solo game soon after. While it was partially the social aspect of hanging out with friends online, it’s not an exaggeration to say that this game helped me stay sane during one of the craziest times of my life thus far and it will always hold a special place for me because of it. But that was also in large part because this game is simply awesome. It’s probably the only game that I ended up loving despite not enjoying the first solid 8 hours or so of gameplay.

OS2 is essentially a TTRPG adapted to a fully realized digital world. While it has mechanics you might expect for a game going for that feel such as dialogue options, it does several other unique things to achieve that feel. For instance, one of the appeals of a TTRPG is that you can do whatever you want within the logic of the game, not just narratively, but with how you maneuver in combat. Considering the limitations of a finite game, OS2 allows for a multitude of combat options that never feels limited, even though obviously it is to some extent. The environment is highly interactable and can be used to your advantage with dynamic and creative environmental conditions. Skills like teleport and various battlefield-warping abilities also do much more clever things beyond just dealing damage. There’s also the system of physical and magic armor that prevents conditions, adding a layer of complexity that encourages strategic play, even though it’s deceptively simple on the surface. I still felt like I had the variety of options available in a TTRPG, even if it was limited to a finite combination of options. It says a lot when being stuck on a given fight could be solved by a better approach rather than simply trying to level up.

Other TTRPG elements deal with the world-building, story, and tone. There’s a rich world with lots of peoples with their own rich histories and varied proclivities, interacting with internal and external factions and nations with their own agendas. I like that the different peoples and factions aren’t the usual monoliths common to fantasy and demonstrate internal diversity. There’s plenty of lore to be explored in Rivellon that makes the stories and locations you encounter come to life.

The tone achieved by the narrative is also on point. One commonality to a lot of TTRPGs is a serious story that inevitably has some silliness as the players get up to some mischief or another. This leads to dramatic and intriguing storylines that are willing to step back for a moment of humor that (ideally) doesn’t break you out of the story. This is exactly how I’d describe OS2. The story is fairly serious and involves some dark themes at times, but at numerous points, especially side quests, there are amusing NPCs and conversations galore that never quite break the narrative but add a good deal of clever humor and even some laugh-out-loud moments without straying into the just plain goofy territory that pulls you from the narrative.

This isn’t the prettiest game I’ve played for its time, but still looks great and I think it’s balanced very well with the playstyle, offering vivid, immersive, appealing scenery that isn’t too confusing to navigate. The audio design is amazing. Sound effects are fine, but the soundtrack is superb. I generally dislike the sort of generic DnD folksy tavern style music that this soundtrack mostly fits into. But for whatever reason, these songs just click with me and never blend together like much of that kind of music usually does to me. If I hear a song from this game, I’ll recognize it immediately. Some tracks are better than others, but overall, they all work quite well. The vast majority of the massive script is also competently voiced, which is incredible.

I found the story pretty strong. There is a main quest full of twists and turns, personal to your character that you must progress to move on with the game. There are a number of side quests as well, a staple of RPGs that can be really hit or miss. While not quite as good as some of the best side quests like Witcher 3, I think the side quests are generally very good. OS2 dodges dull fetch quests and “please kill the rats in my cellar” quests. Even the simplest quests often are made more interesting in some way, such as an early quest in which you have to fight a trio of saltwater crocodiles who have swallowed a pair of teleportation gloves that will be super useful once you get them. The quests are almost always engaging in some way given the strong writing of NPCs and the worldbuilding features that makes these quests entertaining in their own right even aside from the consequent exploration and challenge. None of the quests did I feel like was just some random bullshit I was doing solely to get experience.

There are 6 pre-made characters to choose from. I’ll call these “canon PCs.” Each canon PC has a continuing personal quest such as Lohse’s quest to rid herself of demonic possession or Sebille’s quest for revenge. These quests are a great way to flesh out the main characters, even if they’re not super long and only come up intermittently. Through several playthroughs, I played through the story quests of every canon PC. While my favorites are Lohse, Fane, and Sebille, none of the personal stories fell flat and I can’t imagine playing through the game with one of them in your party without doing their personal quests. Beware, if you make a custom character, you don’t get a personal story.

The gameplay is great. This is almost definitely my favorite combat system for a pure turn-based RPG. The combat is in a lot of ways closer to “turn-based strategy” than purely “RPG,” but this fits the TTRPG style with line of sight, distance, range, positioning, area of effect, enemy weaknesses, and build diversity all being important to your success in a given battle. There’s a wealth of options for each of your four party members to invest in and combine. Even after three playthroughs, there are still styles and skill combinations I’m interested in trying out some time.

This game can be played in a group or solo. In a solo game, you get one main character and fill your party with up to three of the other canon PCs. As a group, each of you has plays their own main character, filling any other slots with side characters. It was really fun experiencing, commentating, and poking fun at the story’s events as a group of three. I enjoyed my group game a bit more on balance, but that will depend on your group. If you have a hard time following the story when communicating with your group, it may not be as enjoyable but we mostly were able to follow it despite talking the whole time on voice chat. The gameplay is solid, but you’re really missing out if you can’t pay attention to the narrative this game has to offer so I’d prioritize that. I found solo play easier as it gives you more control over party synergy and coordination and I was better able to engage with the story and learn the basics of gameplay and strategy. The other major difference is in a group, you have to make sure to listen in on conversations with NPCs or you simply miss story, so you have to coordinate.

Ultimately, this game rocks. On the whole, I loved it and would have to look for things to complain about, the majority of them very minor."
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"Its alright, as long you dont think about it too much."
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"Just finished this game. With my short attention span, it’s really rare to spend 91h on anything, so they must have done something right. I enjoyed most of my time playing the game and I recommend it but it surely has some flaws.

The dialogue was funny and well written. The characters had interesting stories and a lot of personality, which made you invested in solving their problems and storylines. The voice acting was also great. The visuals are pretty good. The towns, dungeons and castles are well designed and textured. I’m not really a fun of turn-based systems - fighting in RPGs to me has always been a necessary evil - but this system was not bad! It’s intuitive enough to understand what you’re doing but leaves a bit of for experimentation. The maps are very big and exploring them feels very rewarding - there’s not much of dull time spent walking around. There’s always an intriguing chest or a quirky npc that’s needs you to do something for them. The freedom in this game is something I haven’t really experienced in any other RPG - you can solve quests in many ways and you can do almost anything you can think of - steal, kill, trick, flirt, etc. I really started to have fun when I decided embrace my thief character and started to sneak into everywhere I shouldn’t be. Most times this was rewarded with loot, information and, some times, even new quests so it didn’t felt inconsequential. Other games would just give me a tag for dialogue. Of course this amount of freedom led to some bugs here and there, but nothing too game breaking.

Here are a few things that could be better (spoiller alert):
- The quest system is a bit confusing, there’s too much information and no way to filter it out.
- There’s too much googling needed. I tried to avoid cheating as much as I could but I spent a lot of time looking at my phone.
- The inventory is hard to manage and could have more filter options and marquee selection.
- Surfaces are an interesting mechanic but some of them clutter the screen. Water and ice are ok, but fire and poison, for example, are way too much - sometimes you can't even see your character.
- The ending felt underwhelming and rushed. The character stories where way more rewarding to finish than the main quest.
- The “cutscenes” could be more epic. They’re just concept art with a tiny bit of animation. Lack of budget, maybe? And why is Windego narrating?
- This is more of an opinion, but too much moral ambiguity in characters can make them all feel similar. They turn into a grey canvas with some specific motivations tossed on top. Sometimes that’s not enough to make you care.
- No more sob stories with animals, please. I almost quit playing after the finding Emmie thing. And then you throw bear cubs, pigs, little chickens… at me? No-one wants this, trust me!

Generally this is a very good game with a lot of potential, but has a few small flaws that, all together, prevent it from being an AMAZING game. 75/100"
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"God this game is good.

Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"[i]This game is really nothing short of amazing.[/i]

Every scene/fight/encounter/quest/anything can be experienced differently in a separate playthrough, by choosing a different dialogue option or by attacking without even attempting to talk or maybe you found a mechanism you had no clue was there before and it immediately gets you past that one fight that took so long the playthrough before. 

This game is exactly what it means to be a ""[b]role-playing game[/b];"" one where you can make your characters into whatever you want, and one where your choices in a single encounter can really have an effect on nearly everything in the game that follows. My friend and I wiped out every single citizen of each town just because we felt like it and could. The downside was that it prevents us from experiencing some of the content that came from them, but it also gave us alternate ways to finish quests that would not have been previously known. 

The game is updated here and there, despite its 2017 release, with ""gift bags"" that add so much original content that I find it ridiculous. 

One more thing... [b]MODS[/b]. The mods that the community make for this game are unreal and add so much to an already incredible game. I personally recommend picking up the Crafting Overhaul mod and at least a few class mods.

All in all, this game is unlike anything I've played before and has unlimited replay value. It's just as fun solo as it is playing with a friend (or three). [b]HIGHLY[/b] recommend to anyone who loves rpg, action, adventure... I mean it's got it all. A very serious [b]10/10[/b]."

Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"Where do I start?
Haven't played any Divinity games. This is my first Divinity game and I see all the hype and positive reviews that this game has and I said fuck it, let's buy it. I'm no stranger to turn based RPG's, played XCOM 2, The Shadowrun series, and some Dragon Quest games so I started this off thinking this'll be a breeze. Boy was I wrong. 

[b] Story [/b]
For a guy who has no knowledge of Divinity lore, the game explains it to me very well. I understood in the first act of the game what the gist is by reading every single book and interacting with every NPC available. Gets more detailed as you go on and that's a treat, I'm a sucker for lore. You won't get the whole story of all the previous games but it's summarized neatly that you won't have to play the other games to understand what the hell is going on here. Be warned, lots of reading.
[b] Characters [/b]
Love them. Every Origin companion has a neat story behind them and you'll understand where they're coming from once you finish their story quests. Your choice of companions is a factor on how some encounters will go. They'll give out pieces of lore as well. Only nitpick I have is that they don't interact with each other, only with you, so if you're used to Mass Effect or Dragon Age companion banter you won't get it here. 
[b] Gameplay [/b]
One thing this game has taught me is that if you want to survive the bullshit being thrown at you like enemies spawning behind you and getting a free hit is that you have to throw bullshit at them as well. Exploit everything. This game won't hold your hand. You're maybe in the starting area but you'll bash your head in a wall if you don't start learning how to be creative. The game begs you to exploit every single thing it has to offer so don't be ashamed to do it. There's more than one way to get out of every encounter here so don't be afraid to experiment as well. 
[b] Bugs [/b]
Few and far between. Game breaking bug I ever got was that I can't click anything to get out of a menu and had to reset my game. Mostly inconveniences. 

My overall experience with this game is that I hated at first because I can't wrap my head around what to do but once I got around it I loved every single bit of it. It deserves every praise it has. 


"
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"This game got me into Turn based RPG games. At first this game has a lot of mechanics and thing to learn. Some aren't even said in game (using the wiki is your best friend for a good portion of quests due to vague steps/hints). You can and will soft block yourself if you bull rush threw this game without taking things slow and reading. 

That being said, the graphics are awesome, every character is voiced (your character speaks random blurbs outside conversations), and you can build your own play style. Pick your own abilities, stats, traits, and skills for you and your party members. 

I would rate it a solid 8/10. 
Solid game-play. Beautiful graphics, effects, and environments. Good replay-ability. 
Wish the journal and quests steps weren't so vague that i needed to have the wiki open on my other screen half the time."

Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"exceedingly excellent storywriting. this is definitely the best rpg I have ever played, choices affect minorly to significantly the events that unfold in your character's journey later, quests can be solved in many ways to your preference. there are just so many things to this game that it feels like you are writing your own story. the turn based combat is very tactical and requires actual thinking. a definitive rpg experience that any rpg enjoyers should buy at full price, gives tw3 a run for its money. note that this is my very first crpg, there might be better ones I have yet experienced."
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"Divinity Original Sin 2 took everything from the first game and improved upon it, giving players one of the best role playing games to date.  

Like the first game, every nook and cranny can be explored.  There are no generic NPCs who mutter the same scripted lines over and over again.  Almost every character has a story, most have a quest.  Every building and area of the map beckons to be explored and rewards you for doing so.  Whereas most role playing games will have you swing through a town, talk to a quest-giver and ride out again, Divinity expects you to become firmly acquainted with your surroundings and the characters who preside there.

While much of the experience is similar to the first Divinity game, Divinity 2 has really improved the character customization and combat that was decent although a bit tedious in the first game.  There are several more classes now, and  classes can be customized and mixed and matched to form some really unique combinations.  The characters are all well written and interesting, and there seems to be enough side quests and content to help you level up and improve your character.  One of my few grips with the first Divinity was that it seemed very difficult to level up and improve yourself.  I do not find that to be the case with Divinity 2.  

The graphics are really nice and don't seem to be too taxing - I would think even a mid to low range PC could run this game.  Ambient effects like motes of light in caverns give the settings a bit of sparkle.  

The only note of caution I have is that this is the type of game with a decent degree of difficulty and little to no hand holding.  When you first start out - you will find your characters with no equipment and just a few spells.  You will have to experiment a lot to find out what battles you can win and slowly piece together your gear and spell power.  Saving before running into a new area or fighting the next battle will become second hand.  

With all that said, if you enjoy the more classic/traditional role playing experience, you should jump on this game when it goes on sale.  It will give you tens of hours of role playing enjoyment."
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an excellent game that perfectly blends the tabletop roleplaying format with a modern turn-based game, and I simply love it. The game is surprisingly hard at times, but the difficulty kept me strategizing and thinking about this game whenever I wasn't playing it, because I knew that I could beat whatever enemy was vexing me, it was just a matter of figuring out how to do so. If you like tabletop games, I definitely think you're missing out if you don't play Divinity: Original Sin 2."

Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"Currently on the 2nd Act of the game, having been playing a lot of RPG games this was the first game that I picked up to try CRPG games specifically and I would say the level of detail and complexity of this game is quite superb! 

Just to inform anyone who plans to buy this game. it takes time to learn the ropes and be able to understand how games like these works, simple decisions can have ripple effects that can stretch to other chapters of the game. Good and bad decisions have a lot of effect on the game. RPG mechanics are very good in this game. has a lot of depth into it put by the developers. If you like games like Baldurs Gate, Pillars of eternity or just want to try out one of the best RPG games on PC I would really suggest this!"
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"This might be the best RPG in terms of gameplay and mechanics you would ever play. The classes, the spell, the many ways in which you can deal with the enemy, it's really unbelievable. And replay value is immense, you never get enough it! Even though the gameplay seems perfect the overall game is not and by far. I didn't really like the story and writing, it was dull to the point that I started skipping dialogue and caring at all about it. It was your typical god and knight story. the environment and map was not bad, but very lacking. not much details, you don't feel immersed in the world like how you are used in other RPGs like Skyrim, Quests in this game are boring and bad, and most of them either end with persuasion or combat. also the game never tells you what to do and the map is really not helping so you will always be searching on google. Also why can't we move to a place using the map? it's really tiring to navigate the whole way to place. maps are only for waypoints.

I really liked how reloading your save in this game is not cheating or ""ruins your experience"", because it actually encourages you to try different strategies and better understand the gameplay system and trying more and more of the many spells and abilities. It was really smart from the device to give you total freedom in this regard. (You were already a god since the start :P)
*Notes and Pro tips;
Thievery is really op and the best talent to exploit, I was at a time in the game kinda stuck, I lose often and I even got bored and left it for months, till I started pickpocketing every driftwood citizen (then the whole of Rivellon lol) and I started buying stronger weapons and gears in a short time I became overpowered.
Always reload your save don't shy away from it! you will be really surprised how in one time you got totally annihilated then reload it and won without a scratch!
positioning your party is key. always try to avoid starting the battle while your all grouped up, because a simple fire ball will destroy the magic shield of your party. use Shift to see the red view of your enemies and sneaking to position your character in the right place.
There is a glitch in the game kinda, conjure your incarnate and make him go alone and attack the enemy, they won't initiate a fight. you can damage and deplete half of their health untill the fight eventually start but they will be an easy pray by then. (it might depends on how many hits they get, so small incarnate won't be much help, raise summoning to 10 as soon as possible to get daddy incarnate.
the most element that I encountered and harmed me the most was fire. and less poison. so having a fire mage will be of help, also Fane was nearly unkillable in my playthrough (but healing him mid battle was pain)
opinions might differ, but the class that helped the most and won me hard battles was the Summoner. even though they are kinda boring so please don't ever play them as a lone wolf.
Archers do INSANE damage like literally they are killing machines, but it's hard to get them to stay alive. and hey have arrows for everything (always use knockdown arrows and charm). I think D:OS 2 is the best game for any Archery lovers.
Always search about quests before hand in Google because the game doesn't help and tell you nothing, you will waste so many xp and good loot, you might even reach the end and be way underleveled.

it's a great game for any RPG fan."

The premade characters come with some really fun stories too. Lohse was my favorite. Sebille's was neat too. It would probably take 100 hours for a single player to beat and do a lot of the stuff."
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"Divinity: Original Sin II released by Belgium studio Larian is quite possibly one of the best RPG ever made and mind-blowing achievement in game design. 

It deliveris a gorgeously detailed game world that was also one of the most reactive worlds I have ever explored in a videogame. The core gameplay loop was deep and satisfying in and of itself, but the sheer overwhelming complexity of the simulation in that game was nothing short of extraordinary.

The game centers around a group of sourcerers who are facing persecution in a world who hates them due to the use of magic facilitating the summoning of monsters from the void. The player character and their party are among these sourcers and the game follows their journey as they find their place in a world that would much rather see them disappear. The story does pick up a few hours in but much like the best RPG’s such as Witcher 3 the story’s real value is in the smaller scenes at its edges rather than at the center.

World is packed to the brim with side-quests. Where this differs from other games in its genre is that even the most extraneous quests bring you up close with some incredibly well-written NPCs with their own quirks and personalities and stories to tell. That writing is brought to life by some excellent voice acting, because every random NPC in Original Sin 2 is fully voiced, too.

The game itself has a surprisingly a lot sense of humour for a story about the persecution of a minority. Certain abilities even let you talk to animals and ghosts. If you think a fully voiced barmaid or shopkeeper is impressive, just wait till you’re able to have entire conversations with every common sewer rat.

Character creation screen is very well designed. You have full free reign over the character you create, although the game recommends you play as one of the pre-made characters who come with their own backstories. This is definitely the way to go. Aside from active combat skills to use, you also select a bunch of social and passive skills (thought they’re preset for the named characters if you go that route) which drastically alter your play style through the game. The way Original Sin 2 differs from other CRPGs is that it’s impossible to create a useless build, literally every character build is a viable way to get through the game.

These classes really shine, as they do in most RPGs, during combat. What at first looks like a simple turn-based system soon reveals itself to be a complex and multifaceted system where you aren’t just minding your stats and abilities but even positioning, elevation, terrain, and environmental effects. Shock magic is more effective if you’re fighting in the rain, or if a character is standing in a puddle. Poisonous gases can be ignited with fire, breaking oil barrels near an open flame will cause it to spread. The complexity of the narrative simulation is present in the game’s physics, too, making sure no two battles ever play out the same way. Thankfully, Original Sin 2 includes a “story mode” difficulty where you can just breeze through the combat and enjoy the story.

Also with a game this large and this complex, the most remarkable thing about Original Sin 2 is just how stable it is. It’s devoid of any game breaking bugs that I know of, and is visually stunning. The soundtrack composed by Borislav Slavov is absolutely phenomenal, and wonderfully captures the melancholy yet adventurous nature of the story. At the character selection screen, you’re asked to select a musical instrument that represents your character, and whenever there’s a prominent story scene or when it’s your turn in combat, the instrument you chose will feature at the forefront of the melody.

As summary Divinity: Original Sin II is one of the best RPG games ever made and is definitely worth your time. Absolute must have for every genre fun.

Using the different preset characters provides wonderful changes every time you play, helping to keep the game surprising. The combat system is very free flowing and the main reason to play this game."
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"People will hate me for this, especially friends, but I just can't get into this game that much, I am trying so hard to like it. For not knowing anything about it, yes it is very difficult. But I don't go into RPGs thinking they will be harder beyond combat choices and knowing where to go--but apparently their combat system (as fun as it is) has a ""depth"" but almost all the enemies just do the typical poison, fire, dodge combos that frustrate you. Early on it is difficult to negate these elements. 

As per the story, I can't get attached to the characters and the main story is muddled already with various elements that don't make sense. 9 hours in and I am still on the Mage island of sorts. Exploration is encouraged but deviated by DEADLY traps and enemies. I either need to be on a walkthrough looking up the order, or trying to experiment over and over for the best options that don't seem to make logical sense. Which is fine, but it is hard so it becomes a chore. 

Out of all the characters, I like Fane. I don't know why. He reminds me of playing Disco Elysium with satire and wit, but that's about it. I don't understand a lot of the systems right away and it becomes a chore. I thought the source muted collars would give an opportunity to learn more about the lore and characters, but they (the characters) all seem to be shoved down your throat with their hardcore demeanor. 

Maybe it's better with a friend? I don't know. I will keep playing, but I am struggling to take this one in. Games shouldn't be fun with an effort. It isn't ""too"" hard, but it feels like it's pushing back too hard in the beginning to make ya wanna play. The intro (ship) was really cool, though. But the mechanics you get excited about are not combat rewarded, but just constant in battle. You never not see them and it becomes annoying. 

The maps are disorienting too. I have pretty good cognitive mapping skills, but in this one, i struggle to remember where things are. I enjoy that all the characters and NPCs have voices though.

but seriously a masterpiece, even greater with it's amazing modding community."
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"Joseph Anderson said something that really changed how I thought about old school RPGs, of the KOTOR and Neverwinter Nights type, when he said that the combat in them was never exactly fun but did contextualise the abilities of the characters in a way that was useful for the fantasy. Playing those games as a kid or a teen, I enjoyed the feeling of winning fights and seeing my character get stronger but the actual act of combat was not something I relished, it was more about the grand characters and the sweeping stories.

Only with Larian games did I find a game that not only has those characters and stories but combines them with gameplay so engaging and fun that you can keep coming back for hour after hour, battle after battle, campaign after campaign. The emphasis on player agency and emergent gameplay keeps things feeling fresh while the dense and layered story and its endlessly enjoyable characters keep you hooked.

A game in a class all of its own."
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this game yet.

In my opinion, [b]Divinity: Original Sin 2[/b] is [i]the[/i] standard for turn-based tactics games. Larian Studios have crafted an absolute masterpiece in this game, and even managed to include quality mod support and extra free customization options.

The world of [b]Divinity: Original Sin 2[/b] is the most compelling virtual world I've ever experienced. Each character's unique backstory adds to your experience in a way that no other game manages to accomplish. The dialogue is excellent, and 90% of the available player dialogue options matched exactly how I thought my characters would react. This game really is an impressive roleplaying experience.

On top of the well-crafted story and dialogue system, the combat system is an absolute joy to play with. There are certainly issues, like the number of surfaces that always seem to show up in combat, but the core system is my favorite tactical turn-based system [b]ever[/b]. The way ability points work, the way your characters' skills interact with one another; it all just feels [i]right[/i].

I am a huge fan of Larian Studios, and I'm excited to play Baldur's Gate 3 when it releases. In the meantime, I'll just keep replaying D:OS 2."
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,hardest thing so far was holding back the tears after realizing you bought the game one day before a 75% sale
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,Love this game but right now on PC it needs to be patched there is too much hacking going on. just lost my progress due to hackers
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,Cute game
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"One of the greatest games ever made, following the footsteps of the first dark souls with improved animations, netcoding and general mechanics. This game feels very smooth and fights are absolutely amazing. Dark souls 3 adds more challenge to the game by making the mobs more aggressive, a lot like in BloodBorn. I absolutely want to recommend this game as a big fan of dark souls series and for the gameplay quality but due to it's state I can not do so, I feel like I have the responsibility to inform you about the situation that's going on in the game. 

Cheaters have taken over the game in large numbers, Dark souls has it's own brutal anti-cheat system but it is very ineffective when cheaters can create alt steam accounts to bypass bans and strike again. The cheating scene has been going on for years and years now but it has evolved to the point where cheaters can actually cause permanent damage to your PC or even pish information you'd not want to share online. These cheats are evolving constantly due to the big playerbase and lack of action from Bandai Namco. So who knows maybe in future Dark souls 3 on steam could work as a backdoor access to your PC in a way. Very high security risk here. I talked to Bandai Namco's support about the issue and they are aware of what is going on and I was told that they are working on the issue, but in truth nothing has been done in 3 years or so when all this started to boom.

If you play this game in OFFLINE mode you will not have any problems, also there are mods such as Blue-Sentinel which is telling you when you are being invaded by a cheater and it tries to block you connecting to them in future, use of this mod is bannable reason but Bandai Namco's anti-cheat can't track it as the mod does not affect the game itself that much. I recommend using this mod if you plan to play the game."
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Extremely good game, however, an ongoing issue yet to be fixed or remotely addressed is the issue with hacking. In the last month, several issues with player's game being completely hacked into with malicious code that not only lets them into your game, but also your hard drive, SSD and potentially more. Check out the reddit for this game and its pinned post or some of the negative reviews below for more info. Great game, but probably one of the worst instances of hacking in terms of severity I've ever seen from a mainstream game that's being completely ignored."
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"[i] “Yes, indeed. It is called Lothric, where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge. In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words: ""The fire fades and the lords go without thrones."" When the link of fire is threatened, the bell tolls, unearthing the old Lords of Cinder from their graves...Aldrich, Saint of the Deep... Farron's Undead Legion, the Abyss Watchers... And the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital, Yhorm the Giant... Only, in truth... the Lords will abandon their thrones... And the Unkindled will rise. Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers.” [/i]

I am a big Souls-Like fan thanks to Dark Souls III, the first game of the genre, and the series, that I have played. 
I have been planning on writing a review about this game for a long time now, but never found the perfect timing to do so. Now, that the game is having a discount, and probably there will be plenty of people coming to give it a look, I decided to write this review. 
Like I did with my Dark Souls: Remastered review on Steam, I will separate this review into 2 main parts: the Technical Aspect and the Story/Plot/Lore of the game. 

 [h1] Technical Aspect: [/h1]

Firstly, I would like to say that this game has not the same mechanics as Dark Souls I and Dark Souls II, they end up being faster-paced, and also a lot of hitboxes issues have been improved. With that said, due to the date of launch of the game, it’s is obviously getting better graphics and textures, 2 aspects that the previous games weren’t strong at. 
Being FromSoftware the company that we are talking about, the scenario, the ambiance and the designs are, of course, on the point and perfectly fit in each occasion of the game, giving the player the same immersion given on the other Soulsborne games. Being even more detailed on that aspect, places like High Wall of Lothric, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, The Ringed City, Archdragon Peak, and Kiln of the First Flame, will mostly pass to the player a feeling of astonishment due to the amazing landscapes and atmosphere that they have. While, on the other hand, there will be areas that will give the player the feeling of progression and curiosity about what is to come, like, Road of Sacrifices, Cathedral of the Deep, Farron Keep, Catacombs of Carthus, and actually most of the other places to visit. 
Just like Dark Souls I, areas in Dark Souls III like Archdragon Peak and Untended Graves will be hidden and will only be discovered with certain triggers. 
The music can be really amazing at some bosses, but at others, it can feel kind of boring, which is a negative trait when compared to Dark Souls I’s unique compositions by Motoi Sakuraba (that being only my opinion though). 
The combat mechanic varied a lot from the previous games to Dark Souls III. Now there are specific habilities and possible combinations with each weapon presented. It synthesized ideas presented before in the other previous games and ended up making a pleasurable result (and, as said before, faster-paced). 
Lastly, to conclude this topic, Dark Souls III is a game that will not feel somewhat tiring when compared to the other Dark Souls, it balances every aspect already mentioned and does an amazing job to entertain the player for the first run until how many times one will feel like to play it again and again and again (in my case, 4 runs have already been completed). 

 [h1] Story/Plot/Lore: [/h1]

It would be impossible to put together every piece of lore in a review, thus I will be summarizing the main plot.
Unkindled, the player is a composition of the ash from the once, fire-devoted, undead that has given itself to the flame, and its duty remains the same. 
The game starts off presenting that the “fire fades” and that the Lords go without thrones. Giving that we are in the same universe set by Dark Souls I and II, we are left with speculations until finally arrive at conclusions by progressing in the game. 
The whereabouts are the “same” as Dark Souls I… However, there are slightly different things that might give the idea of the passage of time. Hundreds, or perhaps, thousands of years have passed since the Age of Fire and mighty new Lords of Cinder have linked the fire to maintain it. Even though there are controversies on the “time” aspect in Dark Souls III. [spoiler] The time seems to be simultaneously blended with the Abyss and dark of long ago (in which the concept of time doesn't exists) and also the present that is experiencing the undying cycle of the fire legacy, which would probably be a base for proving the theory of the End of the World during the Filianore cutscene in The Ringed City (in which there is a burst of light, indicating time, and, consequently, a time-skip beyond the living of anything). [/spoiler]
As for the main objective, the player would have to kill the 4 lords of cinder that neglect themselves to link the flame once again because it would be useless and that they would die in which way. [spoiler] The only one that remains in the Firelink Shrine is Ludleth, whom has long ago linked the fire, and now is just waiting for his end on his throne... for that, he is known as The Exiled. [/spoiler] The objetive of killing those Lords would be to acquire the necessary power in order to link the fire.
Killing every Lord of Cinder and putting their ashes on their thrones will let the player travel to the Kiln of the First Flame, [spoiler] the place where the battle against Soul of Cinder happens, a manifestation of every Lord Soul until then. [/spoiler]
Not only in terms of new Lords of Cinder speculations and lore the game creates its identity, but there would also be the side-bosses encounters that reveal individuals or even groups that shaped the dying world of Dark Souls III (e.g. Pontiff Sulyvahn; Oceiros; etc). 
In terms of DLC (Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City), lore-wise speaking, it presents a rich story completion and also the Grand Finale for the series with the final boss fight against [spoiler] Slave Knight Gael, an undead, like you, seeking the blood of the Dark Soul for his lady's painting, who would be going to paint a new world for humanity. [/spoiler]

 [h1] Conclusion [/h1]

I cannot put in words my passion for the game, I can simply recommend buying it with or without a discount, it is worth each time played and each credit paid. I do not even possess a high knowledge about the game yet, but I am still discovering and reading about its deep and amazing world. 
Got some free time? Get Dark Souls' series to play and you will not regret it."
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"I was subject to the new hack that reset all my save progress and sent me back to firelink shrine, trapping me there.
I had been loving the game and I had just spent the last 37 hours playing.

This security issue needs to be addressed before this game can be recommended again, this is a huge issue that could even cause GPU hacks and totally corrupt your PC.

VALVE ADDRESS THIS NOW, THIS GAME SHOULD BE PULLED FROM YOUR STORE UNTIL THIS IS ADDRESSED!!!

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!"

DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Good game, but is PLAGUED with hackers that teleport, force instant death animations, prevent you from using separation crystal (forcing you to force close the game) and in other cases completely wiping ALL of your progress That's right, a hacker can invade you and simply erase countless hours of progress from your character. They can also force actions on your character that makes the game detect you as a cheater, penalizing you and BANNING you from online forever even though you didn't do anything. While this hasn't happened to me there are plenty of cases of it happening. I cannot recommend the game until this is handled properly by FromSoftware. A system where fair players get banned and hackers continue terrorizing the community is unacceptable."
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Whilst I really like this game, I cannot recommend anyone buying it. There is a serious exploit making the rounds online that lets hackers mess up your save game really bad and Bamco and FromSoftware have been made aware of it a long time ago and they have chosen not to patch it. So unless you use 3rd party software to protect yourself from hackers, you are putting your save game to serious risk every time you engage in online play. Not to mention the plethora of older exploits and hacks that have not been patched. Fix your game From, this is not acceptable."

DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"This is, thematically and in terms of gameplay, the finest game in the Dark Souls trilogy.

Thus, and considering Bandai Namco's and From Software's poor track record with reacting to vulnerability reports, the product as is is extremely not recommended."

However, some hackers have recently become active who can put your character in a NG/NG+ (with all of your gear, inventory and SL) through the very fact of your summoning or invading into your world. Doing so makes your character vulnerable for anti-cheat ban cause now you look like a cheater. Word is that it was reported to the devs about exploits in the net code but they didn't respond. 
And now here I am, losing all 66h progress of my first run because of this.
Stay safe and use anti-cheaters modes, now I am aware that there are some good options out there."

DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Dark Souls... A legendary game series from which was born a whole genre. Does Dark Souls III live up to the title?

Summary:
A masterpiece. I have only completed 4 souls-like games so far(DS3, Code Vein, Ashen, Remnant: from the ashes), as I have stepped into this genre only recently, but this is enough for me to recognise the magnificence of the genre, and, of course, DS3 itself. When I launch a souls-like game, I cannot get into any other game without the completing it. I love pretty much every component: the large variety of weapons, the diversity of builds you can create, the sweaty victory over a hard boss.

Now, lets dive into the pros and cons of Dark Souls III, shall we?

Pros:
-Good visuals. I particularly admire the level of detail
-Loads of quality bosses
-The opportunity to play co-op
-Well-designed weapons and armour
-Class/build diversity
-The difficulty
-Mod support

Cons:
-While playing online, fantoms(hostile players) join your game too often(and I usually die, cuz I'm nub)
-Because of high level of detail, shimmering can be seen if the screen resolution is not high enough(I played 2560x1440, shimmering could be seen). Some graphics mods can partially fix this, though

Conclusion:
With an overwhelming amount of pros, Dark Souls III lives up to the name. Definitely one of the finest games in the souls-like genre."

;

I've had many amazing and terrible experiences with this game, but overall, it's helped me cope with some of the most difficult years of my life. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, general anxiety disorder, and ADHD. I don't think I would have survived the depression and trauma I've experienced lately if it weren't for this game. I failed out of a couple colleges due to mental breakdowns and attempted suicide on several occasions throughout the past 5 years. This game served as an escape from my everyday struggle. It's why I have 400 hours in this game on PC, and around 300 on PS4. I stopped playing this game a year ago, when I was finally in a good mental state of being.

Then the pandemic came.

I've gradually lost the ground of mental stability due to isolation, separation from the person I love the most and my depression being exacerbated. Due to circumstances, I cannot see my partner in person nearly ever. The last time I saw them was in March, and February before that. Although that isn't the most difficult thing I've dealt with this year. In January of 2021, my father had a massive aneurysm that he miraculously survived. Since then, though, he has been severely disabled and bedridden at a hospital. My family and I have been doing our best to keep him strong and on the road to recovery, but it's far from easy. At this point, he will be disabled for the rest of his life. The past couple months have been extremely trying, culminating with me calling the suicide hotline for the first time in years. I never thought I'd get this low again, but life happens, y'know?

Since I called that hotline, I've gotten a bit better. A lot of it has to do with my friends, family, and partner supporting me, as well as the therapy I'm undergoing. I've noticed though that I've really improved once I re-downloaded this game and started playing it again. There's just... something about the immense challenge these soulsborne games present that is so special. Overcoming these challenges are so cathartic and inspiring, and helps me feel capable tackling my real life problems. This game has tortured me at times whenever I struggled to find victory. But I always came back to this game after every defeat, unable to let myself give up. It taught me that can't let myself give up on life, no matter how many times I'm defeated.

I had set a challenge for myself a couple years back: to defeat the Nameless King solo. I had never done this before, and felt I needed to prove to myself I could do it. I am far from a great Souls player, so this was a big deal for me. I spent a year trying to beat Nameless King by myself (I was on NG+7 too, as my best character was on that save). I spec'd and re-spec'd into various builds, until I got my character to be a lightning caster/dark melee build. It was past a year at this point for my attempts. One day, I was going at NK as usual. I managed to get him to half health in his second phase, but I had exhausted all my estus. I kept hacking at him though, little by little getting him lower. He hit me a few times, getting me to being one-hit away from death. At this point, I was close to beating him. Just a few more hits... when he got to being one-hit, I threw out an attack as he began his own attack-- a gamble. And then... 

I did it. I won. I beat him. I watched the cutscene in total shock. Not a word... I was speechless. I lit the bonfire and then broke down into tears of joy and relief. It is still the biggest accomplishment in gaming for me. Overall, I haven't experienced many accomplishments in my life. The feeling of a hard-fought victory, even in a video game, had inspired me to not give up, and still inspires me to keep on going to this day. This game is one of the many reasons why I'm alive today.

I feel like my story isn't particularly uncommon. Many people have comfort games or shows or movies or books, and it's fine still if you don't have one of those. Dark Souls III might not be a comfort game for everyone, but I know the Souls games as a whole have been THAT game for a lot of people still. It could be THAT game for you.

If you've read this far into my story, thank you, I appreciate you so much. If you or someone close to you struggles with suicide, know that it's okay to feel that way. Life is hard and unforgiving at times. Painful, violent, and hopeless. And it will always be like that. But life can be also be immensely fulfilling. Full of love, joy, compassion, laughter, and peace. Hard times are often hard lessons so that we can grow stronger for ourselves and the people around us. The good times come to make life worth living, and the bad times come to make us worthy of life. If you're struggling, please, reach out to someone who cares about you, and if you can't find a person like that, the suicide hotline will be there for you (800-273-8255 if you're in the States). Suicide is a choice you make, but it isn't the only choice you can make. There's always a way out. You can conquer your demons. You are stronger than you know. Against seemingly immense odds, you can win. It's human to struggle. But it's also human to overcome. You got this. So all I have left to say is this:

""Good bye then. Be safe, friend. Don't you dare go Hollow."""

People have begun reporting corrupted saves via invasions and are forced back to the beginning of the game with no way to progress. This can also extend to the PC's command line, which is self-explanatory on why it's an awful idea to even attempt to play this game right now. Until it's fixed, stay away.

DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,I recommend this game to anyone seeking a hard and fun experience. It is impressive from its bossfights to its visuals. Clearly a great game and definetaly worth the purchase.
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Consider that most of my experience with DS3 comes from the PS4 edition. My gametime on PC isn't representative of my experience with the title, which is more fleshed-out on console.

In some ways, DS3 is as much a final refinement as it is a distillation of the ""SoulsBorne"" genre. The core mechanics are the same as the previous two games with some slight balance tweaks - caster types have an easier time making progress in this one, as opposed to DSII - and my gut feeling tells me Stamina costs have been slightly altered in order to be more forgiving, but this could be a personal impression more than a fact.

Otherwise, it's exactly what you'd expect. Slow, ponderous combat that all but demands that you find ways to constrict NPCs into 1v1s for maximum survivability, with a level design and enemy placement that offers anything *but* simple 1v1 opportunities. Sometimes you'll get a restrictive field with an enemy that has more reach, and at other times you'll get more open areas with a gaggle of weaker mobs that all hide one particularly vicious haymaker in their repertoire. These contradictions reward slow progress and careful observation, while also asking that you stay on your toes. These haymakers of the enemies' can absolutely wreck your day at inopportune moments, and you've got Stamina as a limited resource to manage. ""Slow and steady"" is the order of the day, unless you're a seasoned speedrunner. As ever, death revives all previously felled enemies and sends you back to the last-access checkpoint on your save file, so some mistakes can feel far worse than your typical botched run in other games.

On the upside, however, death in the SoulsBorne genre is a teachable moment. The ""core"" crowd might call a player names for missing obvious attack patterns or cues, but all the game itself ever dishes out as punishment is more of its own tricks. Stay frosty, ignore the naysayers who think every player in the genre needs to nurture frame-perfect accuracy, and don't be afraid to take a break. Dark Souls III is going to be as hard and as fair on your first run of the day as on your thirtieth.

Once you've mastered the basics, the ARPG systems at play allow for plenty of customization, provided you're ready to do some digging. Build-essential and approach-specific items and weapons are littered across Lothric's boilerplate Dark Fantasy template, which ensures that none of your starting classes feel like a restrictive measure preventing you from dabbling in other systems. Put some work in, and your PvE-focused mêlée build could very well become proficient with that half-decent bow you just picked up. It isn't obvious from the get-go, but all that's keeping you from turning a pure Caster build into a hybrid class are your own sense of patience, the game's level cap, and the passage of time.

Unfortunately, however, if you're an ARPG player who's looking for bits of clear storytelling, the genre's formula is notorious for having inspired Destiny 2's approach to its own lore. Everything is squirrelled away into item descriptions and in diegetic aspects of the level design. It's great if the genre's allure of mystery pulls at you, but it can be frustrating if you're used to clearly-defined stakes. Imagine that you're playing a misremembered and reinterpreted narrative epic along the lines of the Epic of Gilgamesh or the Poetic Edda, and it'll make the occasionally literal haze easier to swallow.

For fans of the genre, Dark Souls III is an instant classic. For newcomers, it's a punishing action-driven title with one or two more forgiving aspects."

DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,best dark souls game
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,I mean....its dark souls. What else do you need to know?
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Dark Souls III is a game that I've tried to beat multiple times, once around release in 2016, once in 2017, and now in 2021. I picked up the game on a whim because I had heard good things about the Souls series, but after my first attempt at playing the game I felt like I just couldn't beat the game. I enjoyed the weighty combat but I didn't enjoy dying so often to so many regular enemies. In general, I just think the game didn't fully click with me then. The second time I tried it I got much further, but I still died a lot to regular enemies and had a lot of trouble with bosses like the Crystal Sage and the Abyss Watchers. The game made more sense to me but I still didn't really fully understand it and I didn't really understand why the series had such widespread acclaim. That is until my third attempt at beating the game.
About a week ago, I was looking through some games in my Steam Library and stumbled across Dark Souls III and remembered how satisfying the combat was even though I never really was good at it. I decided to give it another shot and I don't know what changed but everything just made sense. I got a lot better at knowing when to attack and when to dodge and even got decent at parrying certain enemies. I started learning enemy movesets and seeing patterns in how they attack and how you can find openings to strike them. I was able to beat some bosses on my first try and ended up getting so hooked to the game I sunk 35 hours into it over the course of a week. It's been a long time since I've played a game that I can't stop thinking about when I'm not playing it but Dark Souls III has been one of those rare games for me.
If you're looking for a game that will challenge you and push you to your limits, this is absolutely the game to play. Anyone who enjoys challenging action games should play this game. It's incredibly frustrating at first but the combat feels so good once it finally clicks and it has genuinely been one of the best gaming experiences I've had in the past few years. Stick with it, watch some videos on YouTube, and don't give up. I promise you won't regret it"
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"It's not often a game filled with wretched beasts and harrowing creatures provides meaningful commentary on the state of the modern American political landscape, but Miyazaki and his team at FromSoftware had no difficulty blending these elements to create an unforgettable and timeless experience. I personally find it amusing that the most effective dismantling of modern American rhetoric comes from a small studio in Japan, rather than some well known American studios, for example Rockstar Games. Around every corner is a fragment of wisdom detailing effective counter-attacks to the most common fallacious arguments used in the world today, commonly by the massive media conglomerates threatening free speech as we know it. Miyazaki, this game is absolutely beautiful and I am honoured to have experienced it. Other video game publishers should be taking notes while playing this, especially Rockstar."

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22330,"I have loved this game for years and my goal is to get 1000 hours in before I leave for the Army for 3 years
Thank you for weeks of fun."
The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22330,"I want to preface this with an admission - I played Skyrim before I played Oblivion. When I first picked it up, I was looking to see where Bethesda had come from and was looking for another similar experience. I loaded it up and was faced with characters made of plasticine, weird dialogue and a floaty combat system that actually killed me if I just ran ahead blindly. I did not like it.

A couple of years on, I came back. I think the biggest shock for me was how different it was and I expected to understand it based on Skyrim. Oblivion is not Skyrim. It's so much more. Oblivion is colourful, funny in all the right ways and the writing... the writing for the quests is phenomenal. There are many characters that you'll find yourself remembering so much further down the line, quests that just stand out as iconic and generally a much more fantastical feeling than I ever got with Skyrim. I've loved both, but give me a choice between the two and I'll gladly step into Cyrodiil for another go. 

The combat handles like you're swinging a pool noodle, but magic is where the combat in this game shines. The level of customisation and the utility of spells is phenomenal, and when you consider how easy it can be to mod this game you can fix any niggling issues you come across. 

I don't know what it is about the NPC dialogue, but even though it's comically bad it's so warming to the heart. The characters care about the world, and even if one will sit there bringing up some major threat only to be met with a complaint about mudcrabs, they all feel connected to the place they live in. I love it.

10/10 would help Sean Bean again"

For new players: if you want to start the best questline in the game, then go to the ruins of Vindasel, southwest of the Imperial City. Within, find and kill Umbra. This is a difficult fight, so you may want to wait until you've gotten a lot stronger. Once you defeat her, take her sword. It's the best in the game. Afterwards, sleep in a bed (this is the most important part). What follows is an amazing thriller that makes up for all the boring fetch quests littered throughout game."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Love the game, BUT...

Has serious lag issues with menus, which never used to be there. So every menu it stutters for 5/10 seconds (on an SSD) pretty sure its having a major problem with loading the thumbnails for items and units. So every time you wanna trade, lag, every time you take prisoners, lag, every time you wanna upgrade your troops, lag.

May seem small but having this constantly with every menu you open gets seriously annoying. Id say get it because its great, and the mods will be unbelievable, but wait until they fix this damn stuttering.

Also dear Devs, literally no one cares about MP, thats not what your fanbase is, so stop updating that rubbish and focus purely on the core game, cheers."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"As someone who followed this project very closely on the official forums I have to say that TaleWorlds is an absolute garbage at their job. They are sidelining the community at every opportunity. They have a track record of hindering any and all attempts of their modding community at fixing their broken game and have shown actual jealousy over the work of their modding scene.
Almost two years ago TW proclaimed that custom, moddable servers can't be made now, but they'll be a thing in 2022, which prompted the modding community to making their own custom servers in few days of work, all by adding few lines of code. TW of course threw a hissy fit over it and patched it out, but it at least shown us how incompetent they are at their own jobs.
""It's early access, you have to lower your expectations"" - My expectations are so low that I had to dig a hole for them to lay in.
This game should have never been released in Early Access. You need tons of mods to make it actually feel alive and fun, something which TW is actively hindering by throwing tantrums at all Total Conversion modders, because once again - players can do a better job than the actual devs.
This whole development process is a farce from start to finish. I honestly hope that when they (maybe) eventually release their 1.6, they'll adress all these issues and stop sidelining players with corpo-talk and tantrums. But it's TaleWorlds, so the reality is that they're probably limiting our possibilities to milk us on future in-game-transactions and mediocre DLCs.
I wish we got the same treatment Warband did with Viking Conquest, which was a joined project of both the developers and the community.

Forums topics I'm referring to in the review are 'An open letter from the Kingdoms of Arda team, and the total-conversion mod community' and 'Multiplayer mods can't be made until 2022 unless we find an alternative', but there are literal hundreds other posts and topics there that show how out of touch and jaded the devs are. I will be posting links to the topics mentioned above below (assuming steam won't delete them)

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"As a young boy my character was enamored by the breadth and depth of the world. Distant lands inhabited by dangerous armies, weapons warped into form by foreign designs. It was all exciting!
Then my character became a man; a sword-wielding nemesis to all opposing. And in his adulthood he elected to realize his worldly infatuation. So he traveled to far places where the weather was cold and armor expensive, to places where men rode horses and shot from a bow. Finally he arrived to a place covered in sand and swarmed by furtive caravans. Here in the sweltering heat a primordial realization, shrouded at first by an unsteady open-mindedness, approached through the desert’s feverish waves. And here my character turned around and left; trading the dusty wastes for verdant forests.

	He retired, after only a few weeks of conquest, to Sargot. In the city he disbanded his forces, wishing them good fortune and used his lingering wealth to purchase a small studio apartment. He then bought a subscription to [i] Old School Runescape [/i] and played out the rest of his days in a game which is slightly less of a fucking grind."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The game has been in EA for more than a year, and I bought into it first day on release. A year on I remain disappointed. Singleplayer, the soul of Warband, is all but abandoned, the multiplayer, frankly, I don't give a fuss about. Constant bug fixes that show no sign of improving, no singleplayer features for increased immersion, only fewer and fewer roleplaying options. I would have left a fuming review a year ago for the unnecessary addition of the poorly-thought-out heir system, and now I have no more hope for a remedy in this game. ""Too complex"" they say -- well I work in IT and an idea is not rejected on if it will be ""too complex"", but if it is needed. If it's ""too complex"", find a way to implement it with less complexity."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Warband but its pretty
Devs hate mutliplayer"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I really like this game but can't recommend it until the AI during battles, especially during sieges, is just even a little better.  
My biggest gripe, one that almost makes me want to just quit completely: During a siege, when attacking, your troops have a couple towers with three ladders each. Your troops will only use one ladder, and even then only go up a hand full at a time which means they get immediately killed by the couple enemy troops waiting at the top. The rest of your troops are just kinda jumbled at the bottom of the tower all trying to climb the one ladder.... even though there are two more right next to it. I've even tried to use my character to push them on to it but that doesn't work either. I know its early access, but it has been a year."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,This is probably the best of the best for its genre. Plenty of room for improvement with many elements of the game but very enjoyable.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Singleplayer is okay, but updates have been minimal for the amount of time Taleworlds has had.  Even worse is the multiplayer side, the only official online modes are Skirmish and Captain, both of which became uninteresting very quickly.  Siege and Team Deathmatch still exist as custom options, but the servers themselves are programmed so poorly that you have about a 50/50 chance that the match will even finish without crashing, then a good 75% chance the server will crash between games.  Taleworlds has had so much time to work on this, yet the server stability has effectively remained the same since launch.  I love the fighting mechanics, I have since Warband, I played on a Napoleonic Wars battalion for a long time, but this has easily been the most disappointing addition to the franchise yet."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I just closed the game probably for the 20th time and said ""I dont know why I keep playing this game"".

The great thing about this game is it's concept. Its a lot of fun if you don't care about the crashes, absolutely dogshit AI, broken sieges, and lazy quests.

These guys have had years to improve upon a great concept, and at every turn, they come short. I find myself playing every few months, hoping they've corrected some very basic problems like Siege and Combat AI. But ... no. Nothing ever changes.

Wait for a dev team that has a clue on what they're doing to make something similar. The market is there - unfortunately Taleworlds just doesnt have the ability to deliver."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,Its not finished and updates come at a snail's pace. A year after release this title still has less features than Warband. Steer clear.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"At launch, it was great fun, the only issues were AI and broken features (perks not working, stuff like that), to be expected of early access. Much time later, the features were fixed (awesome!) but the AI is still really bad, and performance has somehow become much, much worse. 

This is why I can't recommend it. I can tolerate features being broken because the gameplay is still fun, and siege AI can be overlooked because most battles aren't sieges anyway (and Warband's siege AI was bad too). But the menu lag makes the game seriously unplayable. Game lags for like 10 seconds every time you open a menu. That doesn't sound like a long time but seriously, just count to 10 right now, it's a looong time to just sit there, and this game is seriously like 50% menus, dude. It adds up REALLY quick. A good third or so of my gameplay is just me sitting waiting for the game to stop stuttering. It's also really bizarre to me that it's just menus that do this. Battles run very smoothly for me.

I'm going back to Warband I think, I'll check back on this game in like a year and maybe it will be a bit better. Would recommend others do the same."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The long-awaited Mount & Blade: Bannerlord, the life-sucking open-world RPG where skills matter [spoiler]and your feelings of frustration don't[/spoiler] is here!!!! Should we be excited though? Well, as the Germans would say, jein.

""Ja"" because the game improved several aspects. The UI looks much better. They introduced a much needed siege system, in which you actually need to build siege engines to storm a castle - and it is magnificent! There are more commands to control your troops, and they added a smithing system which was severely lacking in the Warband version. They also introduced caravans which is a cool addition.

""Nein"" because teh game is still VERY raw. It is terribly optimized. On lowest settings at FHD (GTX2060) the battles stutter a lot. You have to pass a Will Roll of Diff 25 to endure playing large sieges as a PowerPoint presentation. The smithing system is simply broken. The best two handed swords you craft, using rare materials, will be ~20k worth. A JAVELIN can go as high as 180k. That breaks the economy too - once you can craft javelins you achieved infinite money.

The leveling system seems broken beyond repair and I hope the devs redo it from scratch. There are 6 attributes, each with 3 skills attached. The only purpose of the attributes is to determine how far/fast you can level its skills. You can only level skills by USING them, but as they get closer to the cap, you get a multiplier penalty, e.g. you get only 1/2, then 1/4, until you get no exp at all. To mitigate that, the devs added a ""focus points"" which increases the cap/multiplier for a single skill only (max 5 focus per skill). You get 1 focus point per level, 1 attribute point per 4 levels. The progression is non-linear i.e. the higher the level of the character/skill, the more exp points it needs to progress - but you get LESS exp points due to the multiplier penalty. To eventually get max attributes, you'd need to reach lvl 200-ish.

It is much more intuitive than it sounds. The key problem is that, to level up, you need to progress skills. But to progress skills you need to level up. The non-linear behaviour is TERRIBLY balanced. Even after cheating to get all attributes to 10 (max speed/cap to all skills), after ~40h my character is barely lvl 35 (remember, non-linear; so it gets much worse later). If you try to focus in one attribute/group of skills, you'll level up even slower. Yes, in Bannerlord, specializing is bad!

Once you create a kingdom, your lords force you to declare war on every kingdom with less troops. Lords with traits such as ""Honour"" and ""Honesty"" pass their time pillaging villages. You can also send your companions to form parties to protect your own settlements, but instead they will join the murdering as well - but IN YOUR NAME! There is no ""toggle"". You can't say ""no, bad boy, sit."" You can control some policies of your kingdom, but there is no ""Chill Daddy"" policy and everybody is bloodthirsty the whole time.

I ran out of space but I could still rant about marriage, charming/persuasion, the way the NPCs creeply smile at you as if they'd had mushrooms, the lack of armor crafting, customized troops trees and of a potato at the end of this post.

Mount & Blade is one of my favourite games of all times and Bannerlord SURELY sounds promising. However, it is better to stay away until the devs finish fixing (some of) the problems above. As it is now, it is a bad game. 

No achievements, played on Linux via Proton (thanks Steam!). I will update this review once the game leaves early access!"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"- Glacial development pace ever since its ""early access"" release

- Boring & barebones Singleplayer experience

- Stale Multiplayer scene

- No public indication that further features will bring Singleplayer up-to-par with even a minimally modded Warband

- No hints Multiplayer will receive the breath of fresh air it desperately needs

- Mods required to make Singleplayer fun

- Modders openly angry at Talewords for arbitrarily hindering modding possibilities (affecting the most ambitious overhaul mods)

- No guarantees by Talewords that modders will have the necessary tools in the future

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Review Date: 06/09/2021
Status: Not Recommended
Reason: TaleWorlds has intentionally hard coded sections of the game to make it more difficult for modders to develop new content. These changes do not improve the performance or functionality of the game. TW's Warband owed a large portion of its success to the modding community. As it stands, Bannerlord has progressed at a snails pace and continues to disappoint after years of promised features. Factions are ridiculously uneven, bugs are rampant, and the core game has very little content. In its *current* state I cannot recommend this game."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,In it's current state the game is still missing large amounts of content and is unfortunately being developed at a glacial pace.  I can't recommend it to anyone new to the franchise but it will scratch the itch for anyone with fond memories of Mount and Blade Warband.  I'll update in a few months time if this game has improved and implemented more of its features in an acceptable state.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I've bought this game upon release as I love the free-roam concept however currently without mods the game is close to unplayable eventhough it's been more than a year. I'd rather have the developer stopping patches so the mod community can just fully take over as there's not been any significant patch to the game so far but the patching is making the entire game buggy from a modding perspective.

For anyone that loves the genre, try warband with mods first as in the current state you should only pick up this game when it's presented as a budget option."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The game is great and captivating, a great blend of strategy, tactics, trading, etc ... 

But there are some major flaws, which i hope will be fixed during the game development; and i will then revise my review.

Among these, to name a few, once you become your own king and get some clans to join your faction; you then realize these clans can create armies instantly when you are at war, and you can't do anything about it. Then they go stupidly on 'errands' wasting precious war time resources. There must be a way in the future to have a general strategy and give general guidelines to your armies what they should do, etc ... not just have them in autopilot...
Another one are the ""captains"" during large battles, who are running like stupid on their horses instead of moving toward with the unit they are meant to command. they often run to death in a utterly stupid manner. Kind of game breakin immersion.

You realize all these flaws once you reach the time to become your own king and have to manage your empire. The entire slope to reach this point is really fantastic , but what a let down when you reach this point !

I really hope this gets fixed in the future !!
"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"This is only a graphics upgrade compared to warband. So yeah it's fun. However I really was hoping for more, especially at this price tag. The fact that it doesn't offer much more then warband makes me not recommend it at it's price."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,Honestly not a bad game but I cant in good faith give this game a positive review considering the insane amount of shortcomings that make this game feel like it was made 10 years ago. This is barely anything more than a visual upgrade over Warband at its current state
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,Stutter Simulator
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,Fix smithing and economy already. Instead of changing sheep animation fix your game.. been more than a year now.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"it's a damn good game when it works, but the constant stuttering, frame drops, and crashes make it a hell to play; i don't know if it's because of a recent patch (because this game used to run great), but in its current state i wouldn't recommend. though, i will say it's well worth keeping on your wishlist and waiting for a less janky version of the game.

TLDR: poorly optimized in its current state. check back in a few months and buy it when it's fixed!"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,After a year in Early Access it is still less stable than the last game. i have had more crashes in the last 5 hours of this then in the hundreds i have put in to the last game. many fan made total conversion mods for the last game crash less than this full price game.  Most of that wouldn't be so bad for a early access game  however this has been out for more than a year and that excuse is wearing thin. i haven't played since shortly after it came out and finally today thought i would try it again but even after all that time almost nothing has changed. This game is simply not worth it there are free mods on the steam work shop for the last game that have add more actual content then this full price sequel.  My suggestion is you go play one of those mods for the last game as you will have a better time then you will here.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I retuned back to the game after a few months, updated and now all the menu options in the game are taking about 3 seconds to load up. Battles are running fine, but just every time i open a char menu, trade screen, it runs so slowly. This was not a problem when I first played it, and from what I have seen online this has been going on for a while."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Be me:

*crafts a sword from the finest most valuable materials forged in the fires of the great dragons of skyrim, blessed by the nine divines and shit*

NPC: Best I can do is ~500 gold

*crafts a pointy stick using a literal stick that you can throw at people*

NPC: shut up and take my money

*pays 100k gold*

Me: This has been the greatest trade deal in the history of trade deals!

Anyways, so... Bannerlord... So how should I put it... I haven't really played any of the previous titles. For me, the graphics are a bit too dated and part of my enjoyment comes from good visuals as well as gameplay. Bannerlord definitely has some nice visuals, I'll give it that, but thus far, the gameplay is pretty lackluster. Yeah, this game is in early access and you can't really expect much other than what you get, but the thing is... I've heard some rather nasty stuff about the way this game's development is going.

Just from going to the forums you can already see great dissatisfaction with the game and at first I thought ""Well maybe they're just working on some big patch or something and that's why they've been quiet and all that"" but as I kept reading through all the posts, I realized that uh.. Yea Taleworlds has been doing some pretty crappy stuff like ignoring it's community's requests, scrapping features, making life harder for modders, y'know, stuff like that. With the supposed release being somewhere around Q4 of 2021, and the current state of the game being just the bare minimum, I can safely say this is not the game I thought I was investing my money in and I'll be looking into getting a refund. Unfortunately, I cannot, in good conscience leave my money invested in promises that look like they're about to be broken any day.

The concept of the game is great, I love the idea of leading an army and fighting alongside it, I love sieges, I love the idea of being able to start my own kingdom and rule it, but most of these features are either not implemented, broken, or severely lacking, and word of development has been pretty mum.

My advice? Hold on to your shmekels until release.

I did enjoy playing the game for the sieges, the battles, etc. The game basically has all the concepts I love and wish to see more games based on those concepts, the whole RTSRPG where you make your own hero and control your own army, and fight with them, but so far it's all lacking and quite frankly I fear it might not improve by release, which is why I will be issuing a refund. Perhaps I'll look back into it maybe a few months after the full release, but as of right now? Nah.

Battles are pretty repetitive at a certain point, the economy is whacky, some items are priced ridiculously high so the only way you could efficiently get that much money is through basically exploiting blacksmithing, and the AI is.. quite dumb. Especially in sieges. Like: ""Oh look, we've broken through the gate! But wait! Ladders! Let's go stand next to those like absolute morons rather than climbing on them or... y'know... Going through the main bloody gate!"". The sheer number of troops that just stand there at the bottom of the ladders or a siege tower just doing fuck all is ridiculous. Every time only a handful of soldiers climb up to assault the walls against like half the enemy garrison with shields. Like the assaulting AI thinks they're the bestest troop and can easily take on 50 fully armed soldiers solo. And open field battles are also pretty much just... Let me describe it like this: I see a cliff and I think ""Man, this is a great place to put my archers so that when the enemy comes through, they'll be absolutely demolished by a hailstorm of arrows! I'm such a genius!"" but when I proceed to put my archers on the cliff, they just awkwardly stand there, a few meters away from the edge and just stare off into the desert without shooting at anything, but surprisingly, they still get shot at, and die. So yeah, forget pulling some epic ambush from the cliffs or anything, your archers will just die.

In short, this is EA, can't expect much from it, wait like a few months AFTER release and see if the game has any of the promised features, because right now the release will most likely be like a house with only the frames but without the walls.


EDIT: Couldn't get a refund so I tried to make the most of it. Swadian Armoury FTW.

DEUS VULT, ASERA- I MEAN INFIDEL!"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Its a ""Not at this price"" review"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Can't recommend this game. 

I know it is still EA but after a year you would think the game would have a little more substance for single player. Also menu lag has been so bad the game is pretty much unplayable....."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"After a year of development not much has changed gameplaywise for the single player mode. Constant issues that appear each time this game is updated (meaning there's little polish to what they're releasing), such as huge memory leaks, do not keep my hopes up for the future. 
As a veteran player I'm more than disappointed. For now I cannot recommend this to anyone."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,How can you make such a good base and have NO multiplater COOP? Crazy
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Unfinished. Unpolished. Unbalanced.

The game is atleast a couple years out from being ready for a actual release. A large number of the features advertised back in the pre-EA trailers arent implemented or have been outright cancelled, Several skill-trees still dont work as they should, if at all and Sieges are laughable. 

TaleWorlds have spent a year of EA (which they said 1 year was the target, which has now been extended to 2 years) floundering around and doing nothing of substance. Yes, There has been many patches but only a pittance have had anything of any substance in them. The near 10 year old predecessor provides more to do in the map to this day. 

Dont get me wrong, It's not all bad and the game is much prettier and streamlined compared to Warband and aims alot higher, It's just hardly anything they showed off or advertised is actually there and with current pace of development and rumours that TaleWorlds is working on a new IP, I cant recommend a unfinished game that runs a risk of never actually being finished to anywhere close the standard that was promised.

Disappointing sums up Bannerlord perfectly in my opinion."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,I truly do not understand why a developer would piss off the modding community when it is the thing carrying this thing you call a game. It is incredibly buggy and does not have any near enough content to charge 50 dollars. I hope one day a developer with an actual brain somehow snatches the IP from TaleWorlds and takes actual good care of this series.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,I don't know when they will get this game sorted out but its taking a long time. They can't seem to get rid of the lag and freeze ups. Memory leaks are still present. Maybe one day it will be right.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"It's not a bad game, but developers inability to fix even basic crashes (like, game crashing when you just walking etc.) after more than 1 year of the first release is really disappointing. I bought the game as soon as it's released and since then it's crashing in every gaming session, deleting my whole progress along the way. ""Safe mode"" not really works and I don't even mention the bugs in the game.

Make yourself a favor and don't buy the game until developers can provide a basic, running-game. I'll update the comment when and if these crashing issue is fixed."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I want to like this... I really do but. You're charging full price for a skeleton of a game. First of all, this game wont EVEN LAUNCH through the LAUNCHER. I'm talking crash as soon as I click play. Dev's advice? Clean install, delete hidden files on your computer... verify integrity... check check check... Try again... NOPE. Other users "" you just have an outdated machine lol..."" yeah the computer I built in January? RTX 3090, i9-10900K, 64GB of RAM... 4TBs of SSD Storage space. Yeah. Outdated.... So how do I have 24 hours if the game wont launch from the launcher. Well have to go into the game files, by pass the launcher and run the .exe directly.

Not the bannerlord.exe mind you. A different one because the bannerlord.exe is whats crashing. It's another one, that bypasses the launcher completely. COOL you can play so whats the issue. The issue is the campaign is incomplete and just a slog but hey theres some mods available I think sound fun but oh, the only way to play mods is to select them in the UNUSABLE LAUNCHER AND LAUNCH THE GAME. Great. Fantastic. Do yourself a favor, go elsewhere, play something else. This game doesn't deserve your money.

or if you'd like I'll kick you in the nuts for 47.99.. It'll be the same experience but at a discount."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The successor to Mount and Blade.Is it so bad to get a negative review?Probably not but.....the team behind it lost its way it seems. For those that are looking for a new Warband game, I'd say look somewhere else for now. I bought the game on the first day of release, just to support the company, however after more than a year from the alpha release I am very disappointed. What the producers don't realise is that it wasn't that their first game was that good. As a matter of fact the world was totally lackluster and boring. The first game became a legend because of the mods. So many mods, in so many different universes that it was almost impossible to get bored of it (Warhammer, Star Wars, Medieval, GoT, LoTR and so on). How did they pass this legacy to the new game u ask? In short they did not!!! Modding tools are primitive and the game has hard limits that makes it very difficult to reproduce those epic mods. They did keep up with the boring world though, so in essence the game becomes a grind fest just for the sake of it, in a universe that u don't give a damn. So until they decide to get their game face on and actually help the modding community recreate the previous success this game is a no for me!U are better off with WARBAND!!!!"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,i loved the original mount and blade and this one takes everything and just improves upon it. every aspect of this game screams improved from army managment screens to environment to gameplay to visuals (all of these features can get pretty advanced as well). if you want an excellent total war feeling game that you can play as a soldier on the ground but still command your troops but also participate in the fight then this is the game for you. sometimes frames can drop though in huge battles. but that all depends on your rig. for sure worth a play if you like what i described.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"It's been 1 year since EA and I've been holding back on reviewing the game to give them the benefit of the doubt.

So...what's wrong with it? Ignoring performance issues, the game is an empty shell. It promises a lot but delivers on practically nothing. The features don't gel well together and often times work in a counter productive manner, when it does actually do something. Many npcs still use placeholder texts.

As ""development"" continues, the gap between what was promised and what will be delivered seems to grow. Already, the developers have signalled that they intend to ""simplify"" the game even more to suit a wider audience. It can only get worst, I fear."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"This comes down to a few factors. first, It's a very shallow game. Don't be mistaken the game is very wide in what you can do but none of it has any depth, like questing for example, its the same 4-5 missions over and over. Additionally there's the issue of price, this is not a game worth 50 dollars, even 30 would be pushing it, half the content is just re-used assets from the prior game that have received a graphics update, seriously just watch the character models. Third, the developers don't really do much, for example this game has been out for over a year and the perks are still broken. Note that these are something that should have been working at game release, not even discussing the fact that none of them, not a one,  worked at launch. Fourth, there is still places that say {placeholder text} in a 50 dollar game. This game just lacks content, especially considering the how it was initially presented. This game is shallow, overpriced, underdeveloped, buggy and honestly gets extremely boring after 20 or so hours. Note that I've put in over 200 hour desperately trying to like this game but I can't. This game is just not worth it.  On a side note, the developers saying they've been working on this for supposedly 10 years is utter bull."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The Devs don't care about multiplayer and won't let the community mod online.  The game engine is worse than Warband.  I mean how bad at development do you have to be?  They must have a boner for Empire because they won't fix the one shot stick...... Overall disappointing game. So much potential. 
"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I have a pretty decent rig, and this game cannot stop lagging no matter what settings I change. The system default has all the settings maxed out, but it was lagging so bad it's not fun. Changed settings to very low, but same issue. Changed a bunch of Nvidia settings and cpu settings and it still lags. I would not recommend this product due to the extreme lag which makes it impossible to have fun."

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"In short words: game crashed 3 times in less than 20 minutes (just installed it again)

1 year ago I played this game, I liked it, but some bugs and unpolished aspectd of the game made me think: ""I'll give it some time for them to make the game better""
I'm back after 1 year, Launched the game and shortly after it crashed even before the main screen appeared.
I gave it a second try, reopened the game... 10 minutes playing, finished the tutorial, I pressed ""I"" to open inventory and the game crashes. (I reopened the game and tried again, but ""I"" is bugged and it makes the application crash)
It seems bugs have been getting worse and worse, since from what I remember that never happened to me a year ago,  Unplayable product, encountered 3 crashes in 20 minutes.
After 9 years in production this game is nowhere near finished.

Edit: 
I reseted my computer to factory, reinstalled the game and no more crashes happened (kinda). I played like 30 extra hours in the past week, some crashes happened every so often atleast one every 8 hours.
Still leaving a negative because the game is still unplayable, menus are lagging, they drop to 1fps (or less).
First couple of times after restarting the game it meant that I had once again 2 hours or so of gametime before the bug would appear again, and so I did. Now even If I restart the game the menus go to less than 1 fps. Even before loading the campaign (Start -> Main Menu -> Options) 
Reading on the forums this has been a problem since february (4 months ago) ... 
I will leave this game uninstalled until they make a final and proper release."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The devs should really pick up the pace in developing this game, some modders make better job than them like having banner bearers on your troops. it shouldnt even be a mod it should be automatically in game  its called bannerlord for a reason. smh"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Amazing base, currently less features than warband with day 1 major bugs unfixed.  I'm sure it will all turn out okay in the end but i cannot reccomend buying the game in its current state."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"This game is just honestly incredible.

My first time playing this game I was a little overwhelmed. Not really knowing what to do or how to continue improving my character and army, but once I finally got the hang of it I've now enjoyed every minute of my Bannerlord adventure. If you're new to the M&B Series you may want to do some Tips and Tricks for Bannerlord videos before jumping in. Hopefully there is perhaps a bit more involved campaign to help you understand things better as a new player.

If there is one thing that keeps you coming back for that 1k+ Hours is mods. Having a game that supports mods keeps you enjoying the game, even after doing a full play through. The modding community is INCREDIBLE and I just started checking some out and can honestly say that I haven't even scratched the surface of what this game all brings to the table.

With some early access games you get the initial release and then new updates can become scarce. This is not the case with Bannerlord. Over the past 3-4 months of playing this game I have seen an ABUNDANCE of updates bringing SO MUCH to the game. I am so excited to see what comes next.

I don't normally do reviews but this was SO worth my time. Thank you TaleWorlds for a great game and looking forward to see what is to come!"

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I mean, its mount and blade.
Its a bigger mount and blade now.
Honestly, its a great game that just does so many things right, altho it is at the moment still in the Early Access Stage.
And it deserves to be. I had a siege battle, were I defended the Fortress. Alone. The enemy bugged out and ran against the walls, looking sad at the fortress gate, didnt use ladders, siege weapons or anything. They just ran. And I,..trained to bow skill. A lot. Because defenders can refill ammo. Got around 300 Kills, because my defenders also ran against the walls,....but from the inside. It was fascinating to watch.

I also got around 200 000 Denars or something from a battle once, but,...not that a merc would complain.

The Story isnt finished, the battles are sometimes,...strange, Quests can obviously break, companions are rather,..underwhelming at the moment and sometimes very very generic and even generated in some quest instances. Sometimes you can hire Daughters you saved and stuff like that.

BUT! Flawed as it is, it is still a LOT of fun. The first time you win a melee tournament in a playthru, as your character improves, you get loot and equipment,...as you become a juggernaught on the battlefield, master the bow and sword,...it is really, really fun. But, at the moment, f**k the smithing stamina system."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"As it stands right now it is just a hollow shell of a game.

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"[h1] Rating: 4/5 [/h1] 

Bannerlord is a sandbox war simulation, and is the successor to Warband. In most ways it follows the same formula and maintains the spirit of Warband well, while making huge improvements and adding a lot of features. The battles look and feel dramatically more immersive and fluid, and yet its still just as fun riding around like an ape in front of your army and somehow being rewarded for it. 

[h1] Criticisms [/h1]

In many instances parts of the game feel incomplete, unimplemented, or broken. Despite an excellent early game experience, the glaring unaddressed issues of the game stack up and steeply produce an unsavory late game experience, which needs attention. For a game released over a year ago, most of the early access development has been directed toward optimization and bugfixes, and one can only wonder what type of spaghetti we have been cooking. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1] 

I decided to give this game the same rating as Warband because while it has modernized the original game, progress towards many of its glaring issues has been slow or non-existent. I have some level of optimism that the game will [i] eventually [/i] work its way to a 5, but waiting may also be wise."

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The battles are just plain fun! Managing troops on the fly is a bit clunky for me so I tend to delegate that to the AI while I focus on dishing out death. 146 hours and it's still a thrill. 

The campaign RTS mechanics leave a lot to be desired. It's shallow and repetitive. Overall I recommend, you will get your money's worth."

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"There is about 6 different instanced maps.
Wandering through towns has seemingly zero purpose.
Game play itself is fine but very preventative.

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"good game with constant update, worth more money than COD"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,Honestly there's so much to do. I've been on here for 100 hours just doing quests and slaying bandits; Now I've finally joined a kingdom and figured out what kind(s) of troops I like to use. I played these hours so far not knowing how to command my troops correctly and therefore losing some easily winnable battles. I feel it's been so fun that I don't even mind the baby steps over time. Bannerlord is one of those games that you play for so long that you don't care about save scumming as much and will actually take most of the consequences because they're that eventful!
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"It's good, 8.5/10. The only thing left is for them to fix the siege pathing and maybe some more in-depth lineage/politics and I'd give it a 10/10"

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I purchased Mount & Blade: Warband for £3 as I wasn't prepared to pay £35 for a game I didn't like. After playing Warband for just 20 minutes, I was hooked, and purchased Bannerlord and it's spectacular. The graphics are amazing, the depth is great and the gameplay is super fun and so addictive. I can see myself spending 100s of hours on this game in the coming weeks. 

If you enjoy Strategy games, and games such as Kingdom Come Deliverance & Mordhau. You will have so much fun on the game!"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"as of e1.5 the performance during combat is unbearable. It takes what is normally precise, learned swings into wild guesswork. It spikes constantly and takes the fun out of the best part of the game, its combat. Please fix this shit, i shouldnt be getting 20 fps on all low settings. 

thank you, 
- Warband enthusiast"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I like strategy games. This is by far my favourite. I LOVE Warhammer: TotalWar II. This is, IMHO, better. 
It puts you into the thick of the action. makes you realise what it must have been like for commanders of armies throughout the middle ages. Early on, you're on your own and bandits and raiders can and will kill/imprison you. as you progress you finally get to the late stage in the game where your army is so vast that you feel invincible and bandits are flies to be ignored...that is, until the bigger army comes along. Or you've got 3 or 4 factions rising up against you or one of your lords rebels against your kingdom. 
You get a true sense of what it must have been like as a medieval king, fighting fires all over the kingdom whilst trying to expand the kingdom in one area and trying to defend it in another. 

The gameplay is something else. I love how crap you start off. You fire an arrow and it feels like pot luck if it goes anywhere near your target and then later on, when you've improved your skill, you're firing arrows through apples on top of peoples heads like a regular William Tell. 

its chaos, its fun, it's almost everything I want in a game. 

cons: it doesn't feel finished (there are updates all the time and the people working on this are doing a fantastic job and are clearly working hard. Thank you!). The ""story line"" could be improved/finished and some of the diplomacy could work better. e.g. alliances, trading resources (although they do this with merchant caravans it would be nice to do this on a faction level). the siege battles feel a bit clunky and are some of my less favourite parts, even though they have the potential to be amazing.
I'd like the idea of having stables where you can breed your horses. the attributes of the offspring obviously affected by the skill set of the parents. i assume this would mean a horse skill tree. it's a bit involved but i think it could be fun. It would make me care for my horse a bit better too. 

anyway, i digress. 

TLDR: if you like strategy games like total war, get it."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,güzel
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The game is enjoyable overall, but the development is moving at a snails pace. This has created probably the worst modding scene in gaming at the moment. The amount of mods that must be filtered through to find anything working/relevant is just ridiculous. Which is all the more frustrating because I'd consider mods to be necessary due to bewildering balance choices by the devs..."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"a nice mix between strategy (like total war) and RPG but still need a lot of work,"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"It's with a heavy heart I'm finally writing this review and I hope by the time Early Access is over I can change it to positive, but for now this game falls way short of its potential. Like many others I had been looking forward to this game for years and I began to wonder if it would ever actually be released and now that I've had over an entire year to play, I realized how little amount of fun I've actually had playing it.

One of my all time favorite gaming experiences was playing the Viking Conquest expansion for Mount and Blade Warband, and I'll admit that I'm a little biased as it's a time period I'm really interested in and just always thought Vikings were cool. However it was the story telling and world building that really made this a fun game. I was always interested in meeting new characters and especially new companions as they had their own story that helped make the world feel real. By comparison in Bannerlord I just don't really care about anyone in particular. The starting characters in the game are neat since they'll have a bio written about them in the encyclopedia, but when it comes to the dialog everything just feels lackluster. I've restarted countless playthroughs in this game and in my most recent I schmoozed the Khuzait leader and sweet talked his daughter and ensured our houses would be bound in marriage, cool right? Well to my disappointment there was no wedding ceremony, no feast with the other lords of the realm, just a dialogue from my now father-in-law along the lines of ""Hey you're married now"".

While the RPG elements have fallen short there are certainly improvements in this game and most notably in the graphics and battles. Open field battles are very fun and are the main reason to me for playing the game, I've been in some hairy situations that were amazingly chaotic, kind of like Jon Snow in ""The battle of the Bastards"". However siege battles are still frustrating as an attacker since your troops will choose to use a single ladder when scaling the walls instead of the five available to them, meaning that they arrive one by one at the top to be slaughtered. The AI has been improved somewhat since release but overall playing in sieges can still just be frustrating.

There are other aspects of the game to explore like smithing and trading which honestly can be pretty fun when you flip some trade goods for twice the price, however this is not enough to keep me fully engaged. I really hope the devs start focusing on the single player roleplay and just keep up the good work altogether. This is not a spiteful negative review, but rather a hesitant one that really wants to be positive."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"You like sleep?

Too bad."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I cannot suggest you buy this game at this stage in development. The problem with Bannerlord at this time is that there is too little content. I strongly encourage that you wait until full release (If that day ever comes) before you buy. With the rate we are getting updates at the moment, It looks like we are going to waiting a few more decades for any 'ground breaking' updates."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,modding this game is agonising torture
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"A lot of content is still either broken or missing. Also, leaks have suggested that DLC may be coming. I would recommend at the least holding off until a sale, if not until we see the direction the development team takes."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,Ive waited a long time for this game to release and im not dissapointed. Once the mods start to drop this game will be epic.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The Total war & Dynasty warriors collab we deserved but never got. Until now!
Plays a bit like KUF2 if you're familiar as well, but better.

Current EA state: Requires a LOT of QOL mods off of nexus to remove tedious issues. 
This is a review for 1.5.9 with suggestions for anyone new coming in to fix irritations.

Also needs better endgame (Like the chaos in TW:Warhammer, but....better...because chaos was kind of lame really) As of now its pretty dry endgame, even if you decide to declare war on the entire map. However the start & midgame is amazing.

T5 & 6 weapons & armor needs to be removed from drop rates, crafting & not purchasable from random traders. This is a missed opportunity to give players something to work towards instead of being ""gifted"" god like gear. That's super boring.

Should be obtainable via ingame achievements/goals, or boss-like battles. They really missed an opportunity with this one. Players would spend tons of hours going after gear and it would be a fun grind for it.

Another missed opportunity is not taking the game down the Fantasy Genre route. (Look at the success of TW:Warhammer compared to other TWs for example) Perhaps we'll get it as a DLC or new M&B later. Dragons breathing down fire on the battlefield on a game setup ""like this"" would be jaw dropping.

That said is it playable? Very much so. 

And should you get mods as a new player? Um yea absolutely. I would honestly not play this without mods ""yet"".
The game devs are focusing on the wrong things for updates, but, the mod community has done a fantastic job at fixing these things. 

-Improved Garrisons
-No Relation notices if you care at all about your sanity
-AutoTrader
-Custom Spawns
-Diplomacy
-PartyScreenEnhancements
-Character Reload (To at minimum increase focus of skills, it's a problem, only partly fixed in beta)
-Dismemberment (Fixed) From the dead mod files author on nexus for 1.5.9
-Craft Armor
-Tournaments Enhanced (To skill grind & level, there really isn't another fun way to do this)
-RichVillages (Removes tediousness, no balance offsetting for you or AI, also only partly fixed in beta)
-TruePrisoners (maybe also, if it bugs you, also in the dead mod files authors list)

These should be enough to get anyone started on how the game SHOULD be played like.
From there just add whatever you want but those would be the minimum IMO.

Just be sure to install the required mods and put at top of load order.

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Game crashes as soon as it starts loading I've done everything I can to fix it, and i'm done, it was a fantastic game when it worked but now it just doesn't so i'm uninstalling and probably never going to touch it again.
Which is a bummer."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"very fun, if your a fan of warband play this"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I love this game and Warband, but damn please optimize your game a little better. I got it on sale but still kinda feel like the price should drop another 10 Dollars/euro's/pounds. if you  are 100% new to Mount and blade. just get Warband first and wait for this one to be a more finished product In my opinion."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The ""game"" is bare bones, i think they need more than another 8 years of development to make this one feel like a game."

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,This is a great game and expanded and enhanced the ideas of prior games in the series very nicely.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"If you were a fan of Mount and Blade: Warband's Vanilla gameplay, then you will enjoy this.

However, for me, the part I enjoyed about Warband was its mod-ability. I played very little of Native Warband; instead, I spent the vast majority of my time playing mods such as Warsword Conquest or Anno Domini 1257 AD. From what I understand, Bannerlord does not have the same ability to be modded yet, which means there is currently a lack of total conversion mods. 

I recommend waiting for the final game to release before buying this so you will (hopefully) have access to a wide variety of mods."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"I started the Legend of Heroes series last year before the pandemic. On my review for Trails in the Sky, I asked myself the question. Is it better than Final Fantasy? After 9 games and 940+ hours, that answer is yes, absolutely.

What a gem and I can't believe I'm caught up now. I look forward to the next Heroes story <3"
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"Poorly paced, act 2 was a slog, the curse is terrible writing, the bonding events are poor, the harem is shit, and the music isn't quite up to nihon falcom par.

a disappointing finale to Western Zemuria. 6/10. I'm really sad, because I liked CS3 as well. Go enjoy Sky or Crossbell instead of wasting your time on CS4."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"Trails of Cold Steel IV: The End of Saga... but not really.

It is the last Cold Steel game in name, it wraps up the Erebonia Arc in a kinda satisfying way. Would love it if [spoiler] dead people stays dead [/spoiler] but all in all, a good conclusion to the Erebonia Arc, BUT, it is not really the end of Trails series.

It might be the Fourth Game in the ""Cold Steel"" series but I cannot recommend this to anyone if they only played Cold Steel games in the Trails franchise. So many characters from past arc presented in this game that it's necessary to know them beforehand or you'll be at loss most of the time.

NIS America, waiting for Hajimari news now! Don't take too long, we're waiting"
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"The epic ending to cold steel saga, and it left me wanting for more. I started Cold Steel 1 54days ago, and 572hours later I have completely finished the entire series. Can't wait for Hajimari no Kiseki and hope it gets announced soon.

The Romance was decent, however the harem antics in this were forced and felt bad, Rean clearly only has eyes for Alisa in this, who is often called the ""main heroine"" and it really shows in his interactions in this. Its even better if you carry over a save file from CS3, as the development between them gets even deeper! It feels like Falcom really understood how a real relationship works, including all the troubles that might come with one. The Story in this game is one of its strongest points, but the lovey dovey mushy wushy romancing stuff honestly kept me going because I really wanted to see the ending.

I was able to get a lot of bond characters to their max bond in this to see their final scenes, however I did not like how they all basically forced themselves on him, especially since they all happened after a very specific scene at the midgame which sets up Alisa's relationship with Rean for the rest of it! It felt like they were taking advantage of his situation.

The final chapter with those 5minutes timer was the most tension I've ever felt in a video game and I really congratulate Falcom for doing that.

I didn't know Falcom at all past a few of the older Ys Games and passing mentions from friends, and honestly I'm really glad my friend told me to go buy Cold Steel 1 when it went on sale. I got what I consider world class world building and character development that puts so many other big JRPGs like Final Fantasy and Tales to absolute shame. Falcom has shown me that good JRPGs still exist that still hold firm to traditional mechanics, and you can consider me a Nihon Falcom fan for life."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"While I would recommend this game as it finishes the Erebonian arc and ties up most loose ends, they are a lot of glaring issues plaguing the game and more crucially, Falcom's direction with the series. 

-Rant incoming-
There's a ton of plot contrivance packed with typical JRPG troupes, characters appearing in the nick of time to save the day and a whole load of other shenanigans. The ""power of friendship"" troupe is especially prevalent here. Falcom's typical stellar musical compositions are also not on display in this game. A portion of tracks are remixes or taken from the previous games, while the newer songs lack the musical complexity of the older games. I personally feel the series has devolved with each passing entry, both in terms of plot writing and music. The Liberl arc gave us solid world building and great characters. Crossbell gave us tense political intrigue. The Erebonian arc had an interesting story set-up that just goes full-blown into ""power of friendship"" territory by CS4. After such a strong set-up, the finale just seems so disappointing. 

I just hope Falcom does better with Calvard's arc.  

Thank you for coming to my TED talk. 

-End Rant- 
"
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"Unfortunately the story has completely gone to shit at this particular point in the series, and story is a large majority of the reason this series drew so many fans in in the first place

Major plot points feel like a slap to the face, the writers seemed to have written themselves into a corner and are just taking the completely easy way out. Some foreshadowing just turned out to be complete jokes and character writing is just down the gutter as everyone turns into a Bean Whozer fanboy/girl

I have not even finished the game at this particular point of writing and honestly after the last plot reveal of act 2 I just completely lost the will to continue the game. Old characters come back for nostalgia baiting but do not particular contribute much to the disaster that is the Sen series.

Gone is the political tension from the Crossbell series despite how much Falcom tries to write it in and gone are the good character writing and world building that the series is known for since the Liberl arc

Go and play the previous Legend of Heroes series if you want to experience good story, because the Cold Steel series absolutely does not provide any of it here."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"A perfect ending for the entire cold steel series. If you have yet to play the previous 3 games, I would NOT recommend you to jump right into this, because you will miss TONNES of references, making your experience worse.

What I like about the game:
1. The momentum built-up from the previous game(s) were kept. You won't feel it is a different game, but rather a continuation of the ongoing conflict.
2. There will always be a reason for everything, including [spoiler]why Osborne is following Ishmelga's influence though he has such a strong will[/spoiler]
3. When heroes from previous series, both from Liberl and Crossbell ark joined forces with class VII for common goal, it means business.

What I don't really like about the game:
1. Quite monotonous, though it is not as bad as Trails of Cold Steel 3. You need to do tonnes of side quest. Not the end of the world, but still..
2. [spoiler]Keep fighting the same boss from the previous series, over and over again. Really?? Now I need to fight the steroid version of McBurn?[/spoiler]
3. [spoiler]I would rather keep Olivier and crew members in the exploded Courageous remain dead, to make the story even dramatic.[/spoiler]"
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"This game is great, but don't fucking start here PLEASE. Play the other cold steel games first, they are great too. And if you have A LOT of time on your hands play the Trails in the Sky trilogy too!"
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"Trails of Cold Steel IV is a well executed final entry in an amazing JPRG series. The finale of the civil war drama might have an outdated presentation, but relies on a deep story as well as character development. Though it does have its shortcomings, Cold Steel IV is nevertheless a great sendoff for the Cold Steel series.

9/10. Worth the time."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"Honestly I feel like I shouldn't even write a review for this game because most people who will be looking at this have probably already played at least all the cold steel games and know what they are getting into. The only thing I will say is that this game is best experienced if you have played every game in the series, have read most of the in game novels, and have read/watched a lot of the materials that are not part of the game (ring of judgement, Cs2 drama cd, etc.) This game references like everything that is part of the series and as a die hard fan it was really great to see that falcom renumbers a lot of this stuff. Overall this game is very good and if you are a trails fan what are you waiting for. 

Also if you are planning on playing Hajimari when it comes out please read this games novel three and nines it is very good."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,Starts off immediately after Cold Steel 3. Absolutely fantastic series--the Legend of Heroes saga has become my favorite RPG story of all time.
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"ngl the ending got me in the first half

In all seriousness, a great conclusion to a great series. Leaves a bit for the later arcs but a must play nonetheless. They did say this was an Avengers: End Game for Trails, and did not disappoint. Looking forward to see what else Zemuria has to offer."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,Amazing game. Never thought i'd obsess over a series like I would with Trails of Cold Steel. Now going through my 2nd play through of all four games.
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"Doesn't quite live up to the Sky series and Zero/Ao, but it's still enjoyable. Beware of a bajillion anime stereotypes, however."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"☆ (This isn't so much a review as something akin to my own personal feelings toward the game)

Honestly I typically don't bother writing reviews when it comes to any game I complete however since this marks the ending of the saga and at the moment of writing this only having just finished the game moments ago, with my hype levels through the roof I genuinely couldn't resist typing one up anyway.

Now I won't try to sell this game to anyone reading because if you're here then the chances are you've already completed every entry up until this fourth one and have probably already bought the game, waiting for it to install whilst browsing over other peoples comments and thoughts.

Let me just say that this series is a masterpiece whilst sure it definitely has a couple of shortcomings for example the rather obnoxious harem aspect which by my opinion wasn't as terrible as other people make it out to be however, I cannot deny the story would be a little better if let's say there was an actual singular love interest because that would at least leave some girls for the other characters to pair up with rather than having Rean horde them all for himself.

In conclusion before I ramble on any further I have played every game up to this point including Zero and Azure meaning without a doubt I'll be following this series for years to come, (Although hopefully Hajimari comes quicker than what I'm unfortunately expecting) and I may even replay some including the recently released GeoFront Azure translation.

Anyway thanks for reading my rambling thoughts and I hope everyone is as excited for Hajimari and Kuro as much as  I obviously am, last but absolutely not least; Sara is best girl & Laura is an insanely close second."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"I just finished this game a few minutes ago and here my thoughts.

For the conclusion of the Cold Steel games this was extremely enjoyable to play through. After putting in 105 hours in this one, this has to be the longest Trails game that I have put hours in. 

I am wondering if Falcom will make another chapter of the Legend of Heroes series but I hope they do. 

"
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"The culmination of the epic series, it is definitely a fitting ending.  Tons of content and cameos throughout as well as great nods back to previous games.  Makes you wish they would bring the Crossbell arc over in English so you can appreciate the tie ins with that series.  Well worth your time to pick up and play if you love the series.  I look forward to the next game in this universe.

Spoilers follow: 
[spoiler]My major issue with the game is a few of the plot points that were either missed or felt forced.  The major one being Claire and Lechter.  In Cold Steel II and III Claire was elevated to near main character status and was definitely a love interest.  This is all lost in IV sadly as her entire plot line is basically forgotten about only given a bit of lip service.  I felt that all the other major NPC's got substantial time but Claire got left out as it seemed like they didn't know what to do with her.  It would have been nice to have her join the Radiant Wings and be a more important factor as I think it would have been logical to her arc.  Lechter as well this could have worked for but for Claire it was a big missed moment after a lot of the work they did building her up in the previous games.

The second ending as well could have been worked in more naturally.  Once you got into it it was great and I get why it was done this way.  However the entire thing felt very forced.  That said the ending fight was a blast, especially having all the characters available.

Finally I thought the romance options suffered in this game and were not as organic and deep as previous games.  A lot to wrap up I know but several girls it felt like you were starting back from square one or the moments weren't that romantic at all.[/spoiler]"
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"The 4th and final game Cold Steel Saga within the Trails series. 9 games worth of build up for many (but not all) plot points of the series culminates in this masterpiece of a game. My favorite RPG series of all time having played RPGs since the 90s. If you have already played the Trails in the Sky arc and the Trails from Zero arc, and you have played the other Trails of Cold Steel games, then this game should be an automatic no-thought-given purchase and very worth it at that. The game play and music are great too. The game excels in all areas except graphics but lower quality graphics compared to modern standards never bothered me to begin with."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"This game feels like a reward for playing Trails. Don't start with this game, but it's a great addition to the Trails story."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"Yes
Just Yes"
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"This is not a game, it's a journey and this is not even the best starting point(That's definitely the Sky series) but it's an amazing part of the journey nonetheless. It became my favorite once I finished it. It's not perfect and sometimes the budget shows but still an unique experience that you won't find anywhere else. And it gets better every new game. 

It definitely could use more support in the West though, so Falcom can finally starting shipping worldwide to multiple consoles at the same time or at least not months later after the Japanese version."
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"I'm not used to writing long reviews on Steam whatsoever so bear with me here. However [b]Persona 4 Golden[/b] is such a gem that requires essay-long review.

If you are not into reading, I'll summarize the game shortly.

Imagine a game, that is practically timeless. Where game play and story matters more than pretty graphics and visual effects. PERSONA 4 is that game. Absolute masterpiece with amazing music, captivating story and likable characters.

I'll stay as spoiler-free as possible in this review. As everyone should go into this game blind. Trust me, reading game guides ruined some elements for me. However I might mention some things that may land into spoiler territory. You've been warned.

[i]Think of Persona as a game that doesn't have definite genre. Instead it's bunch of different sub-genres combined into one. JRPG with traditional turn-based RPG tropes, slice of life high school simulator and dating simulator in the same time. That in one package. [/i]

I went into this game completely blind. I only knew that game has RPG and slice of life elements. And quite frankly, outside of Mario and Luigi series, I've never played turn-based RPG game in my life. But after playing Persona 4 Golden, I'm eager to try out other turn-based RPG games.

You are playing as silent protagonist (canonically named Yu Narukami) who is moving to small town called Inaba for a year. Just after arriving to Inaba, town starts experiencing mysterious murder cases that police have trouble solving. One way or another, MC and his newly-found friends become entangled with murders - therefore trying to solve the case instead of unavailing local police. I can't go into greater detail about the story, but it is strongest part of this game. And like I said, I recommend experiencing it blind. But let's just say, this was first time I felt emotional during a video game (single player anyway).

Main gameplay is split into two different parts. High school life on Inaba and turn-based combat on shadow world. Each day you can decide to spend time improving your relations (such as going to movies with your friends), study to improve your social stats or enter the shadow world to solve the mystery. Game constantly reminds you that your time is limited and you should choose wisely what to do each day. As if you don't do specific tasks due to certain date, you'll be prompted with game over (or more specifically, rewind time). 

Combat feels great in this game. You and your friends can perform all sorts of attacks/spells ranging from physical attacks to elemental attacks and obviously buffs/debuffs. Each enemy type has its own strength and weakness that you can exploit to your own advantage. Enemies can also reflect and absorb your attacks so learning enemy weaknesses are beneficial part of combat. Sometimes you may even need to swap out certain characters as they may be in significant disadvantage on some boss fights. However I found every character to be perfectly balanced and usable in almost any situation (if built carefully). 

Somewhat major flaw I did find from leveling system though. If playing on lower difficulty level (as I did for start), it is very easy to over level, which makes game too easy (i'm serious, just play the game on hard difficulty for very least). To level up, you have to defeat monsters on shadow world. So I did the obvious and changed difficulty of the game. And oh boy, leveling becomes extremely tedious on end of the game. You aren't forced to level your characters, however it grants stat-increases and new spells for your persona, which helps tremendously. On later dungeons, only non-time consuming way to level is to eliminate [spoiler]golden hands[/spoiler] that are very annoying to slay. 

Also I found enemy types to be very generic reskins of older opponents you face on lower leveled dungeons. HOWEVER this is explained in the game itself so I let it slide.

These are only complaints I have with the game though (and I presume most RPG games have this ""problem"" anyways). But during mid game, I avoided combat like plague in order to avoid plain grinding -  [spoiler]only to max out every character by the end and being ridiculously strong during final boss /shrug.[/spoiler]

Slice of life game play is surprisingly fun though. Game establishes very early on that your strength heavily depends on your social links with other people around you. So during the day and after school, your goal is to both increase your social stats and solve your friends' problems. You can only do limited tasks per day though so you have to choose wisely how you invest your day. Perhaps you want to increase your understanding stat, but you [strike]need[/strike] want to hang out with Yosuke. Or maybe you need to enter shadow world instead. Constant feel of pressure is somehow very fitting and adds replayability to multiple playthroughs as you can choose to go through events differently that time around. Dating aspect also adds to this. 

Outside of gameplay, Persona 4 also has scripted cutscenes/events that provide excellent piece of humor and plot twists. I don't know how many times I thought story was going to end, only to find out that game had barely even started. Once you play the game, you know exactly what I mean. Story throws you off multiple times.

What I was very surprised about was that Persona 4 has so much content, that it kept throwing new stuff at me every moment. In fact, I was playing the endgame dungeon and still found out something new that game has to offer. You may question how I managed to spend over 100 hours on single playthrough. But I seriously wanted to experience everything this game had to offer. I was so addicted. And still managed to miss half of the game's content. This is as I missed most social links, didn't max my social stats and missed some events. Which I will happily come back to with NEW GAME+ in year or two. Oh, and did I mention that this game has [spoiler]multiple endings[/spoiler]?

Like I mentioned before, Persona 4 may not have the prettier graphics, in fact this Steam version is just a port of PS VITA game from 2012 which was rerelease of PS2 game from 2008. However it doesn't need fancy graphics. Even if character models feel clunky sometimes, voice acting and artwork makes it up. Character animation itself still looks decent today. Also not to forget that Golden has some animated shorts that are used as cinematic set pieces from Persona 4 Animation that still looks good to this day. 

Crown jewel of this game though absolutely is the [b]SOUNDTRACK[/b]. Persona games are known for their excellent soundtrack and P4G does not disappoint. Not gonna lie, this was first time I felt like dancing while playing a game. I mean seriously, you don't even need to buy the game for its soundtrack. It is available for free on Spotify. Never expected vocal tracks to work this well with turn-based combat. I absolutely adore guitar usage as well. But yep, buckle up, time to jam out during combat. Time to make history.

But all I'm trying to say is that you should absolutely give this game a try (especially now that SEGA owns Atlus and they'll most likely release Persona 5 port soon. Pretty please). Even if you aren't fan of anime or JRPG games, I found it to be one of those games that are enjoyable despite having no background on certain genre. For me that being turn-based RPGs and high school sims. 

And I know this review is very messy. Perhaps I'll fix it some day, just like how I'll 100% this game some day too. Only time will tell. In mean time, check out this [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CujlchNaHNc]2 hour long analysis video[/url] by Nam's Compendium - if you are interested. It sums up pretty much everything I want to say and what the game has to offer. Containing spoilers obviously.

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Engaging story, wonderful characters that make you laugh and really addictive gameplay makes this one of the best games I have ever played. One of the most enjoyable aspects of the game is the great soundtrack, which never disappoints.  

As a newcomer to the series I can assure that anyone remotely interested in RPGs/Visual Novels/Turned-Based Games should give it a go, as a newbie to the series or not."

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Jokes, memes, and cred this game has with people who are aware of the existence, nothing more I can say other then definitely a game if you like modern contemporary RPGs (as opposed to the usual medieval sword/shield type RPGs). Definitely not for everyone, but if you are completely unaware of the story (which might be hard at this point since it's like ten years old) and like story driven games (and don't mind strategy turn based RPGs) definitely worth playing."

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,Jungian psychology meets Japanese Creation mythology meets a band of highschoolers plus some awesome dungeon crawling. It's an amazing mix that make for a very engaging game.
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Persona is one of those franchises you'll probably never truly understand its appeal until you play it yourself. P4G is a masterpiece for mixing different genres and ideas into one well-made package. The number of positive reviews speaks for the game's quality.

Now please port Persona 3 FES and Persona 5 Royal to PC Atlus!"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"It's that wholesome feel and bond with the characters along with the combat and cool persona's that keeps me coming back. The story and the people you bond with over the course of the game is the main aspect of the game.
The soundtrack has many bangers like ""heaven"", ""nevermore"" and ""i'll face myself""
10/10"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"P4G was one of those game that almost ALMOST tempt me to buy a vita, i am really glad that it came to pc.

I felt that it is unfair to compare it to P3 or P5 series as game play, UI and quality of life continuously improve over each series. But one thing is for sure, no matter which series they ALL have kickass soundtrack

For people that have never play a persona series before, the tldr version of persona is pretty much sim+rpg you need to balance both mystery solving and friendship building to succeed in this game.

For ppl who enjoy both visual novel and jrpg do check this game out.

Lastly, hope they bring P3 and P5R into steam, i would gladly play those two again.

Lastly lastly, felt that Yukiko is kind of underrated so wanted to give her a shout out"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,Yukiko is the only way
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Persona 4 Golden prompted many to buy a Playstation Vita years after its release, just to play this game. That should tell you everything you need to know about how high the quality of P4G is. While the randomly-generated dungeons and art style are dated by this point, especially when compared to the painstakingly-polished presentation of Persona 5, this story and the characters within it will draw the interest of anybody who can get past the overly long introductory section characteristic of the more recent installments in the series. Once beyond that, however, players will find themselves within an addictive gameplay loop involving dungeon crawling through an elemental weakness, turn-based combat system familiar to fans of Shin Megami Tensei and Pokemon alike, as well as a social simulator requiring both time management and an understanding of the availability of their friends to maximize the content they experience throughout their playthrough. This back-and-forth is largely addictive, drawing players into the lives of several characters, which often highlight the struggles of adolescence and the meaning of ""truth,"" but there is some varying quality among the social links that are either less interesting or unappealing in personality. 

While on the topic of cons, players of the following game may find themselves surprised by the fact that they'll need to grind to get all party members to the same range of levels, as only those in the party get experience from battles. The process of knowing what level one needs to be in an area is very much trial-and-error, which can result in aggravating deaths followed by grind sessions to raise you and your party's level to fuse more powerful Personas. Ultimately, though, the process of using skill cards and fusing personas to build a powerful team with a wide array of elemental strengths to cover the spread of possible weaknesses ends up being a (mostly) satisfying experience that can scratch some of the Pokedex itch through filling the Compendium of possible creations.

Lastly, story is an important component of a game with as daunting a runtime as any of the Persona games. The story of P4G is a far more understated affair when compared to the world-ending, metropolitan escapades of P3 and P5, revolving around a small-town murder mystery and ""seeking out the truth."" Social links often involve relationships between family members, unspoken feelings, and personal weaknesses, frequently culminating in realizations of personal and/or objective ""truth."" This theme carries out within the stellar soundtrack, particularly within the battle theme. Other tracks cover the spread of poppy sounds, from the head bopping ""Sounds of Love"" to the wistful ""Snowflakes."" All said and done, the main story has some twists and turns, ultimately being good enough to run alongside the social links and combat mechanics and bring the game to a satisfying conclusion. Perhaps expected, the story does suffer a bit from some anime trope-iness that adds some of the ""fate of humanity"" elements from the other games in the series, but this does little to tarnish what is executed well here.

CONS:
-Long-ass introduction section
-Buy a few tickets to Grind City if you like to be overly prepared for bosses/mini-bosses
-Slight plot tropes characteristic of recent Persona series entries
-Expectedly dated visuals and dungeon generation system

PROS:
-Consistent themes and interesting characters
-Social simulator aspect of the game is top-tier
-Soundtrack is top-tier
-Main story being a mystery keeps interest involved
-Persona Compendium and fusing a fun distraction

OneLine: If you like JRPGs, anime, and have no real social life, this will temporarily make your miserable life happy with polygonal friends for around 80 hours

8/10"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"In term of story, Persona 3 is the best but have some boring characters. Persona 4 story is decent, its just wannabe detective stuff, BUT the characters are so loveable its very good"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,scooby-doo gang solve murders by going into TVs
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"If you like JRPGs in the slightest you owe it to yourself to play this game, its a piece of JRPG history, one of the greats. I'm not going to even try and cover the behemoth of a game that is Persona 4 Golden in detail and honestly I feel analysis is better after you have experienced the game.

It shows its age, the pacing isn't always the greatest and it takes some real commitment to really experience it all, but damn it's worth it, the music, the characters, the charm and personality is unrivaled, you feel like you've really lived in Inaba.

If you can make it through this game without tearing up at least once, I'm convinced you have no soul. (Atlus please make a P3FES/P3P remaster and bring DDS to steam)"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"This game is great in every way, the story characters and music are all some of the best out there.  I geniunly think that this game has the best characters out of any game.  It shows that everybody has flaws and does a great job making you like these characters."
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,""" A D A C H I "". 10/10 IGGN"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,idk i just i like persona
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Probably one of the best games I've played through so far. I bought this game on a whim after hearing all the praise about the series in general and I do not regret that decision in the slightest. What is in this game originally released on the PS Vita is a story, characters, environments, and especially music that are all so full of life. I'm writing this review about 2 months after I beat the game/last played it, but I can still say that this game is probably the best I've played so far this year. I'm still thinking about the story, listening to the music, missing the friends I made, and looking back at my time fondly in small town Inaba weeks after I've said farewell to this game. Persona 4 Golden is an experience you won't forget. That being said it's very much aimed at jrpg fans and anime fans in general, but I think this game can be enjoyed by people who are new to both as well. 
Also, Chie is best girl."
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,very nice love it. so true love the persona series. 10/10
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,Game slaps. Nuff said
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"One of the best games of all time, just buy It already"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"What. A. Great. Game.

Persona 4 Golden (P4G) was a game that I loved when I beat it on my PlayStation Vita and I still enjoyed it just as much ~8 years later on PC. Originally I purchased this game because Atlus NEEDS to port more Persona/Shin Megami Tensei (Persona 5 Royal please) but I found a point in my backlog of games where I had that itch for a long JRPG and it was great to jump into P4G.

The thing I probably love most about this game is the day-to-day management of the main character and social links. There is something really fun about deciding what you want to do that day and play The Sims for a bit. But the pacing is also incredible because every time I started to get burnt out or bored of the management I would be hit with a dungeon or main story plot to investigate. Between the social links, combat, persona fusions, and more you really feel like you are playing a lot of different genres in one singular game.

If you are looking for a JRPG that reviews well, is reasonably priced, and that is a ton of fun, buy P4G, and hopefully Atlus will continue to port more games over."
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,10/10 easily one of my favorite games
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Its totally bringing back the good old days, Awesome ATLUS, now give us Persona 5 Royal please."

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"This has easily become one of my favourite JRPGs recently. The characters are so memorable, dialogue is funny and the music really gets you in the mood for battles and atmospheres. I've only played a very small part of the game so far but I am loving it heaps. A cool game that lifted my mood when I am feeling down.

Now we need a Persona 5 Royal port :)

EDIT: I wanted to add some more input on the game, it really has made me reflect on things occurring in real life (crazy aye), but it opened my eyes to many important things. Especially the value of pursuing your true self and accepting all things that happen, no matter how bad it gets, a really important part of life (this got deep quick...). Nonetheless, P4G really throws some crazy stuff at you and provides important life lessons (something uncommon in games)."
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,I don't even know what to say. This game was fantastic from start to end. I feel empty now that i beat it and i now have the post persona depression i had when i beat persona 5. Please BUY THIS GAME AND PLAY IT
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,One of my most favorite games ever! Didn't even know that this amazing game was on steam!
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Out of the 366 games I have on Steam, this is the only one that recognizes Wii U Pro controllers on top of PS4 controllers, even linked through steam's controller configurations. I don't know why or how or even WHO at Atlus thought to do this but for doing so they get a positive review from me"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Engaging story, lovable characters and great gameplay. It also has Naoto in it."

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Haven't finished it yet but this game is amazing. There is a bit of a change coming from Persona 5 to 4, but most of the fundamentals stay the same.  $13-$20 is an absolute steal for a game of this length and quality. Cannot recommend this enough."

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Most likely my favourite game of all time, maybe interchangeably with other games in the franchise. Obviously a biased review considering that fact but these games earned that through my enjoyment of them. I find that these games have the most engrossing stories of any games I've played and as a result the masterpiece RPG aspect of the game feels like a bonus that was added on top of an already engaging slice-of-life story about truth and ignorance."
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Very, VERY good RPG. Amazing story and interesting characters. IMO the gameplay itself isn't very exciting (opted to play on a easy difficulty due to this) but going through the story and experiences easily make up for it. It takes a rather long time to complete the game (even with skimming most of the grindy RPG parts like leveling up and acquiring gear), playing on a harder difficulty / NG+ you can easily get +100 hours of playtime from this.

4.5/5 - Top 3 RPG's in my book."
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,Awesome school-life legendary JRPG.
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"After freshly moving into the small town of Inaba, I started to enjoy the simpler things in life such as going to school, studying for my exams and spending precious moments singing the JUNES theme with Nanako....

All I want to do is spend 65 hours with my friends in this perpetual cycle and this is ruined on a regular basis!!
I've spent over 65 hours trying to lead this peaceful life and I wouldn't trade those for the world.

Stop reading this, stop searching about Persona 4 Golden, just buy it right now and move to Inaba for a few months (maybe a year)!"

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Where do I even begin with this game? This is my favourite Persona game in the series and even my 2nd favourite video game of all time with likeable characters and amazing gameplay. The story is also well written especially towards the end of the game where it leaves you on the edge of your seat. The OST in this game is perfect, from ""Heartbeat, Heartbreak"" to ""The Fog"", each track fits this game amazingly. Overall this is a MUST PLAY for JRPG fans out there. 11/10 experience."
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"pretty good game


except the fact teddie exist"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"The combat is pretty standard turn based style. The characters and story are amazing. Played through this with a few friends, and now I check steam every day to see if a P5R port has been added. This game is a must play, and at $20 it's a steal. 10/10"

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"I can't fully express what this game means to me.  It's my first Persona or Shin Megami Tensei game and I can't believe how long I've been missing out.  The characters shine with such inner beauty that it makes me cry, some of the songs do the same thing (especially Time To Make History).  The gameplay, while flawed, is the best that I have ever experienced in an RPG and I've played a lot.  My life has been changed for the better by this game and I'm only on the second dungeon as of this review.  ""Masterpiece"" does not do it justice, this is the greatest work of art humans have produced (unless the others in the series are better).  Please bring the rest to Steam!"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"it's P4G, the best JRPG ever, what more do I need to say"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,I'm cool playing second banana.
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"This game's a lot of fun, with vibrant characters, a wonderful soundtrack, great tunes, and compelling gameplay. Definitely worth playing."
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,this game gives me major persona vibes
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"[i] Persona 4 Golden is a Turn-Based Visual Novel/Role-Playing Game about solving the mysterious Murders in Inaba while trying to find who the true culprit is. [/i]
Like Persona 5 if you played that game first like me, you have a time limit in about a year in in-game days before your interactions and social links are locked, [spoiler] unless you have maxed out Marie's social link first. [/spoiler]

If you have noticed, this game a ported version of P4 Golden onto the PC, nothing has changed besides changing your options like setting dialogue to Japanese Audio and such

I'll go over the Pros and Cons listed here 

[h1] Pros  [/h1]

Amazing Soundtrack, The Almighty and I'll Face Myself (February Boss Remix) are great songs
Great Characters, my favorite being Tohru Adachi, Yosuke Hanamura, Kanji Tatsumi, and [spoiler] Best Girl [/spoiler] Naoto Shirogane
Interesting Detective-Like Story
Tohru Adachi
An actual fun Turn-based combat game
Multiple Endings

And in short, Really Fun and Engaging Combat with a Wonderful Story with also including some great characters

There's a Stutter Issue whenever the prompt for All Out Attacks that currently isn't fixable, it's just a port issue
[spoiler] At the end of the game, it has the most boring cliché of the power of friendship with whoever you maxed out your social link with [/spoiler]

And that's pretty much my cons, or more so my complaints of the game really, not a whole lot, and I think that's a good thing 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Persona 4 Golden is pretty much a good old Classic Game that still holds up today, not by graphics but just really good characters and a great story, Overall, it's worth your price

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"I'm at an age where I'm losing interest in video game.
i would struggle and finish a game just for the sake of it.
In fact I would be glad i finish a game because I don't think i can clear my Steam library in 2 lifetime.

Enter Persona 4. 
This game is a masterpiece. 
Never have i been so engrossed to a video game that I would play it the moment I'm home. 
The storyline, soundtrack, atmosphere and cast are amazing. 
Fusing Persona to get the desired one. The twist and turn. The gameplay. The dating sims element. Just thinking about this game is giving me goosebump. 

Get this game. Perfect 10/10
Now I'm feeling empty after finishing it. I wish this game never end."

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Oh come on, what's not to like with this masterpiece??"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"I'm about 20 hours into this and I'm already debating if I should see it to the end.  For context, I was really into the original Persona games on PS1.  They were so different than all the other JRPGs out there with the modern setting and bizarre combat.  When the PS2 rolled around I eventually got into the Digital Devil Saga games as well as Nocturne, which are excellent.  Then came Persona 3.  While there were some good changes such as the removal of monster negotiations and a larger character count, there was a huge shift away from the combat side of things and a lot more emphasis put on the life simulator.  Your ultimate goal was to scale a tower at night where every floor was randomly generated but none of them were unique or interesting, but most of your time was spent just being a regular high school student.  After ~95 hours of playing, I never wanted to play another Atlus game again.

Despite that, I went ahead with P4, and it's even worst than I imagined.  The combat/exploration part has been nearly removed completely and about 90% of the game thus far has been visual novel/dating simulator.  Nearly every day consists of two choices: what you want to do after school and what you want to do in the evening to either boost your bonds with people or grow personal skills that will help you boost bonds with people.  I don't care about any of this; I want to explore dungeons and fight monsters.  However, again, the dungeons in this game are completely uninteresting and the combat gets repetitive very quickly.

That said, it is good if this is the kind of thing you're looking for.  If you want to pretend to be a Japanese high school student navigating his time between working a part-time job, making friends, and dating multiple women, it's a well crafted game in that regard.  If you're more interested in exploring, combat, and strategy, wait for the remastered Nocturne to come down in price."

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,Runs perfectly on Linux. (Thanks to all involved for supporting Linux.)
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"A timeless classic and a masterpiece, a must-play if you're new to the Witcher series. This game will make you feel like a real Witcher through smart use of many gameplay mechanics such as potions, signs, sword oils and such. Combat is a bit clunky but it is easy to get used to, and if you time your dodges and play smart, and of course if you strenghten yourself with necessary potions before combat, the monsters will feel the wrath of a proper monster slayer

Story 10/10
Gameplay 8/10
Graphics (for its time) 9/10

Overall 9/10

Playing for the 3rd time, this game never gets boring or repetetive. Especially after watching the show, and playing the third game, returning to the Witcher 2 was a welcoming experience. Seeing familiar faces and assessing them through a difference perspective with the knowledge of The Witcher 3, books and the Netflix show really add alot to the story. If you're new to the series, obviously your perspective will be more of a discover's, but if you're a returning player, you will be the observer and you will understand certain plot aspects even more comprehensively.

A must-play and defenitely worth a re-play after the third game.

And of course, if you have the time and the interest for Witcher universe, I would suggest playing both paths the game provides to the player. They're both unique paths and act as stand-alone games where the story, places you visit and the characters you meet completely changes."

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"This is a game that you can replay and experience an entirely different story. Though choices in this game sometimes do give the illusion of choice, I felt I was actually making an impact on the story and path. 
It was arguably more bloody and gritty, with a harsher dialogue and plot than the other two.

I did have a bit of trouble running the game during one of the first missons (though I saw others had a similar problem and it was quickly solved) 

Graphics and aesthetics of the game look so good and characters (cough Iorveth cough) definitely are a hightlight of the game with their developement and backgrounds. I could go on but I think the game can speak for itself."

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"This game is just as great as the day it released. Save often. Die often. Repeat. Slow progress is better than no progress. It also sets up The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in many ways, including importing save files, which can have more impact than I would have suspected. If you were like me, and had actually played TW3 first, and then went back and played this one, it is absolutely worthwhile.  I will warn that this game is not nearly as easy as TW3. Wild Hunt on its hardest difficulty is about equal to this game on normal. Save often."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"Amazing Game! The Music, The story, The Open World, The character development, The Side Missions, Everything is top notch!"
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"I am about five hours in, and I have tried getting Geralt laid several times. I am a little upset that there's only been two sex scenes after choosing the flirty dialogue at every opportunity. The gameplay is pretty alright, it's not too bad but not the best either. I visited the brothel and tried to bed one of the hookers, but that didn't work so I just looted all her goodies instead. Previously in this review I mentioned the number of sex scenes to be pretty disappointing, some of the shots in this game are very tasteful so quality over quantity I guess. It's a good game if you have nothing better to do and want to see the occasional set of tits."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"I'll start off by saying that i really really wanted to like this game and consider the witcher series on of my favourite.
Having said that, i unfortunately have to say that this game is ""fine"". 
The story is compelling and, while the writing could be better at times, it delivers a really interesting experience;
the graphics are overall way better than the witcher 1 (duh...) and even years after release they hold up quite well.
The thing that bothers me is the way Geralt ""feels"": i don't mean to say that he is bland or anything, it's just that the controls are GOD AWFUL.
Some will say ""but the combat system in the witcher 1 is bad"": first of all, no, the witcher 1 had a combat system that was perfectly fine and serviceable even at the hardest difficulty; secondly while a direct comparison can't be made between the two because of obvious reasons, you could compare the combat of this game with other games.
The first thing is that the controls feel ""sticky""whenever i push a button there's always a small but noticeable delay and every action feels like you are controlling a 90 years old man rather than a monster killer mutant, i still don't understand why there must be an animation that lasts for seconds and stops you whenever casting a sign.
Potions in this game are a joke, the effects of the potions are shorter to balance the fact that now you don't need an alchemical base and the toxicity lasts way less, however potions seem to do basically nothing and if they do something it's worthless, might as well save yourself the trouble and skip the whole animation of  someone getting on their knees and drink a swig, might have been cool to prepare first if the whole potion/buffs thing was worth the trouble.
The dodge button is wild, it either does nothing or it shoots you in the next town over from where the enemy is standing, also enemies can still hit you sometimes even if you dodge.
To conclude, this could have been a favorite for me, but it isn't, the controls are just too frustrating.
I gave a thumbs up only because steam doesn't allow for a third option of ""it depends"", get it for the story i guess, but be warned that if you want to play the witcher 3 you can just simulate a save."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"If you're coming here after playing Witcher 3, know that this game is a lot more technically difficult. I'm garbage at the dexterity aspect of games, and was still eventually able to play Wild Hunt on the hardest settings; Assassins of Kings, on the other hand, was a challenge even on easy mode. 

If you, too, are garbage at games, don't despair! It's doable* as long as you're prepared to repeat boss fights and die a lot.  The story is compelling and forces you to make meaningful choices between two evils, just as you'd expect from good Witcher content. Definitely worth it if you're a Witcher fan.

* except for the secret boss. You're gonna try it a million times, tear your hair out, lose your grip on reality, then give up and accept the non-combat option."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"Is so far almost the best game of the Polish studio, but The Witcher 2 is not far from The Witcher 3."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,Excellent game love it
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"Great game. Just a little bit unoptimized, but most complaining people are actually trying to run it on a 1992 bread toaster and getting surprised that it's not running above 60 FPS. But yeah, some small troubles."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"The Witcher 2 is less about Witchering and more about how a Witcher is trapped around the political machinations of the Northern Kingdoms, It's Sorceresses and how it intertwined with the Third Nilfgaardian War.

Throughout the campaign you are forced to take a side either, first it's either team Blue (Roche) or team green (Iorveth), then in support of ruler A or ruler B, or help a sorceress or not, but thankfully the player is given an opportunity to maintain the stance of neutrality as a true Witcher and that taking sides was merely choosing the lesser evil rather than wholeheartedly support one kingdom after the other, however all depends entirely to your chosen dialogue. In terms of gameplay this makes the ending showcases a different outcome depending on the results that unfold because of your choice, which might carry different dialogues on Witcher 3. 

In terms of story I say this is a brilliant, in my opinion. People most likely don't like W2 story because it's rather confusing for newer players and full of political intrigues and conspiracy, key events that shaped the story in W2 (like the Battle of Brenna, Thanedd coup, the dissolving of the Brotherhood of Sorceress and lastly the formation of The Lodge of Sorceresses) isn't shown in-game, and explained either by text or by a bit of dialogues with certain key characters which can easily be missed.

Gameplay wise, is a quantum leap from W1 but a step behind W3. It's a proper action now rather than point and click action Diablo style of W1. The world isn't open like W3, but one medium sized map each chapter (there are 3), but still interesting because it has quality quests, every quest has its own twists rather than uninteresting filler quests (like AC:Odyssesy) but the same cannot be said for contract quests because they are are not interesting not like Witcher 3, it's only for making money. Potions have to be taken outside battle, by meditating (a bit more realistic but more hassle), signs especially Quen is needed because you often had to fight in cramped space, other than quen, Igni is the most useful along with axii (for cutscene), Aard for shielded enemy and Yrden is basically useless (you can slash Wraiths without Yrden).

The story and writing is excellent, dialogues and voice acting are excellent, these are what I like most about the game.
 
I have more hours than what is shown, by playing on another platform. So 40 hours is about the length of a single playthrough (all quests done on one story branch).

So if you're a fan of Witcher 3 (most likely the entry point game for new Witcher fans) and liked the lore, and never played the other , buy this, recommended. Just wait for sales (Witcher Series are often on sale including W1, if it's not on Steam, other platform like gog) if you're in doubt."

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"Toda una experiencia de rol. 

Logra elevar el molde narrativo instaurado por BioWare y que para la fecha de estreno de este juego representaba la créme de la créme en cuanto a WRPG's, dándole  una textura étnica, sabor y una atención al detalle apabullante que sigue destacando hoy en día.

Todas las elecciones ofrecidas  de cara a construir un hilo narrativo multinivel de primera categoría, resultando en un juego de rol e intriga política a la altura del universo concebido por Sapkowski, además de mantenerse mecánicamente interesante de principio a fin.

El sistema de combate, aunque polarizante, me ha resultado divertidísimo y sorprendentemente respetuoso con la agencia del jugador. De buenas a primeras podrá parecer algo simplón, a la vez que se las arregla para resultar obtuso: esto culpa de una interfaz que si bien no es terrible, si deja mucho que desear. Una vez superada la (penosa) fase tutorial, el juego se abre de cara a una multitud posibilidades de interacción sistémica que mantuvieron fresco el combate de principio a fin, aunque ciertamente no se trate de un juego al que se vuelve una y otra vez por su hack & slash.


Se trata de una experiencia increíblemente inmersiva: NPC's con rutinas creíbles, quizás recibiendo inspiración del trabajo de Piranha Bytes con su franquicia Gothic y su peculiar fórmula. Todo su universo construído y sosteniendo una de las ilusiones jugables más creíbles que he tenido el placer de disfrutar. Altísimos valores de producción (gráficamente muy vistoso, incluso para el 2021), buenas interpretaciones de voz y un sentido del gusto considerable.

Assassins of Kings es un juego denso. Narrativamente, las intrigas que nos presenta son difíciles de seguir; aunque sumamente satisfactorias, en especial para los seguidores del universo literario. Pocos juegos presentan conflictos tan matizados, con tantas decisiones y tantas resoluciones posibles mientras mantiene un sentido del espectáculo completamente AAA.

Sin más ni menos, uno de los mejores y más memorables clásicos del rol moderno."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"I played all 3 Witcher games and this one would be the third if I must rank them. I felt too much like an ""already made"" hero in this one. It was too linear and short for my taste. I didn´t feel the immersion as in other two. But it was also full of story on the other hand. I feel like the developers were trying a different approach from the first one and it wasn´t always the best approach. But overall it is balanced, you can make a lot of visible decisions and the story was really interesting.

I liked: all minigames (controls really suited me and the animations were nice),
visual side of the game,
story was interesting and well explained in the end,
characters were convincing and I really cared about them.

I didn´t like:
map - navigating and map were horrible,
inventory - names instead of pictures (I somehow got used to it after time but still didn´t like it),
you don´t have a free movement, it is the same movement system as in 1st Witcher,
music was not bad but also not really memorable,
story choices could be more ""explained"" I would like to have more evidence to base my decisions on,
there is no Yennefer, still only Triss (I feel that she would deserve to be there. Geralt could go to find her after the final talk with Letho. It could also make the game longer as I find it really short.)

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,Fun game. Needs a few mods to make it playable.
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"I started playing The Witcher 2 for the story, but that was the only thing that kept me playing through the end. The game has occasional bugs and much of the interface/controls feel clunky. Fortunately, mod support means that some quality-of-life mods take most of the tedium out of the game and let you focus on the fun parts.

For me, the fun parts were not the combat but the exploration and side-stories that flesh out the larger picture. The story stands up on repeated plays as you identify hidden meanings behind the dialog that you missed the first time around. The combat was uninspired and painfully frustrating. The combat does not scale well: certain enemies (or bosses) will crush new players until the player discovers the ""trick"" to win. When the trick is learned, the fights can become overwhelmingly easy but that learning process is not fun.

If you're a Witcher fan, try the game out, play on easy or normal mode, and enjoy the story. As a standalone game, take a pass to save yourself some frustration and play something else."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"Only played through the tutorial, but what a disappointment. I enjoyed Witcher 1, but the controls and combat system in this sequel are ridiculous. Overly console-oriented UI and controls yet frustrating to figure out what to press for what spell or quickslot, and no apparent way to rebind (or see the key map) in-game. The final tutorial fight was just inane with no chance to figure out the mechanics. Regardless of how interesting the writing & plot may be, the gameplay doesn't make it worth it. I've read elsewhere this should be skipped and go right to Witcher 3, so I'll try that. Life's too short for this."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"Undoubtedly, this game has very nice music, story, characters etc. But I couldn't finish it because the gameplay doesn't fit today's games and makes it difficult to continue. That's why I don't recommend starting this game after finishing Witcher 3. Maybe we can see a remastered version or something in the future, but I'll wait until that day."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"The odd middle child in the Witcher trilogy. Where the first game was a scrappy underdog and Wild Hunt became a swaggering juggernaut of role-playing, Assassins of Kings is the series trying to find its voice. While its graphics and overall presentation are a massive improvement from the first game, its gameplay is a clunky, restrictive, and rough-edged prototype of Wild Hunt. But Assassins of Kings has the strongest and most intriguing main plotline of the series, filled with political and personal complexities and a second act that's completely different depending on your choices. I love Wild Hunt, but Assassins of Kings is all the more unique for its focused story and branching narrative."

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"Best story of any game I have ever played.

Also has severe racism and slavery.

Awesome 10/10."
The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"Many people (myself included) feel that the gaming industry, and media in general; has changed over the years. Some of it was inevitable. With the Internet more accessible than ever, it's understandably difficult to create a sense of mystery. The late 90s and early 2000s were a different time, and a lot of the experiences people remember simply can't be recaptured because they were exclusive and dependent to that time and the limitations of technology of the day.

However, I'd say the mindset of the industry itself has shifted. A focus on mass appeal is clearly more prevalent. In fairness, the market being catered to has also shifted significantly since 2002 due to the reasons above and others, such as games being seen as an equivalent entertainment medium to cinema and TV instead of just a nerdy pastime. Companies like Bethesda are just doing what corporations do by changing their strategy. I'm not trying to excuse any of their actions in recent years, I'm just illustrating that it's all par for the course.

That's not what I'm here to discuss, though.

Morrowind is truly Bethesda at their finest. It's an experience like no other, from an era when innovation and creativity were strong in the gaming industry. In my opinion, the developers didn't seem to be attempting to please anyone aside from themselves. This doesn't feel at all like the product of an unfeeling corporation, as many more modern games do to an extent (in my opinion).

When you get off that boat in Seyda Neen, you are a pathetic nobody. A weakling dressed in rags. You suck at everything, including walking. You will be awkwardly ""hobbling"" (to use a generous term) around for a good chunk of the early game.

This game doesn't hand you anything, but if you're willing to put the effort into learning its systems and rules, there are no limits to what you can accomplish. The design of the game blurs the line between features and exploits in the best possible way. I'm not exaggerating when I say for any frustration you have with the gameplay, there is a way around it. Trust me, by the end of your playthrough, you'll be something very different from the filthy prisoner nobody you start out as.

You literally become a God. Similar to the Dragonborn arc in Skyrim, but much more epic and executed in a much more satisfying way.

Little advice
The beginning of the game can be frustrating and slow. STICK WITH IT. Don't be afraid to toggle off auto-run and cautiously approach enemies, especially early in the game. That green fatigue bar is deceptively important. The higher your fatigue, the better chance you have of hitting an enemy, casting a spell, or doing literally anything else.

You're on your own now. Good luck."
The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"With not much interesting gaming going on these days I thought it would be cool to revisit a classic. So here's what's what.

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind in an RPG like no other. Apparently written under the rule of psychoactive drugs, it climaxes in a bizarre that is both zodiacal and surreal. The adventure takes place in Vvardenfell, an island closer to the extraterrestrial rather than the fantastical. It  is a vessel of the game's penchant for amalgamation, be it of tribal cultures and rival civilizations, apocryphal beliefs and astral prophecies, revanchist doctrines and occult interests or carnal desires and transcendental ambitions. Between cynical politicians and embodied deities (some of them false, by the way), drug dealers and infernal powers, the player experiences a unique sensation of freedom. Not just freedom of action in the way they choose their course, but also freedom of thought as they follow ascension along a path of Machiavelian pragmatism or simply forlorn wandering in the pursuit of divinity. 

With the game being almost two decades old by now, it can be a bit of a headache to get it to run smoothly on present-day machines. However, there's plenty of written and video guides that cover the essentials. Particularly if you care about a minimal installation featuring hardware compatibility and bug fixing (the only things that are truly needed to enjoy the game, in my opinion), you can get everything set up in under an hour. It's totally worth it, because by the time you've set foot in Morrowind, you'll be scratching your head and wondering why people stopped making games like this."

Thank St. Jiub for the good deeds he's done for Vvardenfell."
The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"Just to give some context, I missed this game when it came out (I was too busy playing Starcraft and Diablo II), the first Elder Scrolls I've played was Oblivion, so there's no nostalgia factor in this review. By the way, this is going to be a lengthy review and I haven't completed my playthrough yet.

For people who want to get into this game I would recommend getting some graphics mods as the game looks dated. I use Morrowind Code Patch which fixes a lot of bugs and tweaks some of the core gameplay mechanics which where broken and MGE XE which is the graphics extender for widescreen resolution support, shaders, draw distance and such. With these two you will get a game which still looks kinda dated, but much better than vanilla and closer to Oblivion. I also use the better heads, bodies, clothes and armor mods too. These are just visual mods, and completely optional.

Again, for those who haven't played this, but are considering in doing so, there are a few things which might seem unfair for players not used to this style of rpg.

First of all, there is no fast travel, at least not in the modern gaming sense. Fast travel is done by silt striders, boats and teleportation from the Mages Guild. You can actually get around the map pretty easily with those, if you have the coin. I actually like this, because it incorporates fast travel into the gameplay, adding to the immersion.

Secondly, the quest system is old school and there are no quest markers. Your journal acts as an actual journal, so sifting through pages to find details about a quest might seem cumbersome. There's an options button in the journal to view info about topics or quests, I don't know if this is added by the mods I use or included in vanilla, but they help a lot.

Furthermore, at the start of the game you are just some random chump, you MIGHT fulfill an ancient prophecy, but until then you are just one random character in a world full of others like you. You are not Dragonborn, neither are you the one that Patrick Stewart aka Captain Jean-Luc Picard aka Uriel Septim saw in his dreams. You are just one among many. This again, I believe, adds to the experience, because the sense of progression in this game is immense. At the start, you will struggle against the most basic of wildlife, flailing at them haplessly like a drunkard trying to fight a signpost and later on you will one shot those.

Last but not least, people say that the game does not hold your hand. I disagree. While it does not have quest markers, easy to clear dungeons at the start and fast travel, there's a key to all of this madness. And the key is that you need to listen to the NPC's. When the characters in the game tell you to take the silt strider, take the silt strider. When they tell you to maybe get some training in a skill, get some training, if you have the money. When a character tells you that an area is dangerous, it is. And again, when someone tells you that if you want to go to some uncivilized place, have some potions of restore health, restore fatigue, cure disease and some scrolls of Divine or Almsivi Intervention, get those. Use those scrolls if you get into a fight you think you can't win, they will save your hide. Also, gold is the butter of life in Morrowind, so you can *ehem* gift people to like you more and give better info.

That's my review and recommendations. If you like a classic, proper rpg experience and you don't mind the dated graphics or doing a bit of modding to improve the experience, I highly recommend this. I know all of this sounds like some elitist drivel about gitting gud, but these are things that I like, because they help me immerse myself in this world. If you do not have the patience for all of these, then get Skyrim or Oblivion, and good for you, because those are fantastic games and I know for a fact that after a hard day's work I like to kick back and relax too sometimes and not bang my head against the wall to find the Burial Mound of XYZ. For the current price of 15EUR, this is a steal. The rest of the review will be me ranting about all the crazy stuff I did in this game with minor(ish) SPOILERS ahead.

The guy you work for in the first part of the game is part of the imperial ""special"" service, aka The Blades. I say he's ""special"", because this guy has a crippling addiction to moon sugar. And he also looks like a grandfather on steroids.

I play a mage, so standard fare would be me running around casting spells, right? WRONG! I do not run around like a chump, because I have the Boots of Blinding Speed which make me fast as Sonic the Hedgehog. I also do not walk, I levitate with extraordinary speed, blind as a bat, casting spells which can decimate whole villages, like some kind of bathrobe wearing God of Thunder, if I have the magicka.

The Telvanni, who are a faction in this game (among many) are very powerful wizards who live in gigantic mushroom towers  which they grow themselves. You can grow one of your own, and I am at that stage now. You become prominent in Telvanni society by murdering your rivals, which is legit. They also do not have staircases, you need to levitate, because they do not accommodate peasants and barbarians (their words).

I was asked to deliver a skirt to a wizard lady, who asked me to put them on first, just in case they are cursed, just to put them on and be attacked by her that I am now wearing her clothes (an amulet of Divine Intervention helped here).

A bandit robbed a noble lady, and then the lady asked me to deliver a message to the bandit (they are apparently living happily ever-after after from all accounts).

A champion of the imperial legion asked me in an indirect fashion to massacre a bunch of citizens he should be protecting. They were crooked anyhow and I got a ring of partial invisibility from that.

I also have disturbing dreams and get attacked by Dunmer who do not have faces from time to time in my sleep.

Edit: All in all, this game gives me a sense of what an rpg game was and what the genre could have been. Unfortunately the genre has gone the way of ""mainstream appeal"" which means nothing to be honest, except graphics and instead of levitating like a god above the terrain, we nowadays enter instanced towns, which is disappointing."

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"Its a little rough at the start both game-play wise and for figuring out what you are supposed to do. Morrowind is a game that I would recommend using a guide for first time players or at least checking the internet from time to time to avoid frustration. It helps to remember that this game is designed on tabletop D&D type mechanics.

All That being said, If you put in the time, this is one of the most complex, atmospheric, and immersive experiences you will have with an RPG. Add in a few mods and this game is incredible. The setting, characters, and quests are fantastic and full of life. Exploring is rewarding and each cavern and temple can lead to unexpected places or encounters. I still find new things after years of playing this game and I have been playing it on and off since it came out in 2002. I think Morrowind is a serious contender for one of the greatest games of all time. So give it a try. Its not without its flaws but come for the experience and stay for the memes."

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"Bat Out of Hell is the 1977 debut album by American rock singer Meat Loaf and composer Jim Steinman. It was developed from a musical, Neverland, a futuristic rock version of Peter Pan, which Steinman wrote for a workshop in 1974. The album was recorded during 1975–1976 at various studios, including Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, produced by Todd Rundgren, and released in October 1977 by Cleveland International/Epic Records.[2] Its musical style is influenced by Steinman's appreciation of Richard Wagner, Phil Spector, Bruce Springsteen and The Who. Bat Out of Hell has spawned two Meat Loaf sequel albums: Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell and Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose.

Bat Out of Hell is one of the best-selling albums of all time, having sold over 50 million copies worldwide.[3] It is certified 14x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[4] As of June 2019, it has spent 522 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, the second longest chart run by a studio album.[5] Rolling Stone ranked it at number 343 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[6][7]

A musical based on Bat Out of Hell, staged by Jay Scheib, opened at the Manchester Opera House on February 17, 2017, before transferring to the London Coliseum and Toronto's Ed Mirvish Theatre in late 2017.[8] April 2, 2018 till January 5, 2019 it was running at the Dominion Theatre, London,[9] with plans to run the show in parallel in Germany[10] and in a tour of the United States in 2019, however, the American tour was canceled during its early performances.[11]"

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"Remember when Bethesda made good games?

Yeah, this is a classic, and is in my opinion one of the best Western RPGs ever made. It has flaws, of course, but the degree of mechanical flexibility, the quality of the lore and story writing, and the engaging world design make this well worth playing if you haven't already."
The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"Many people (myself included) feel that the gaming industry, and media in general; has changed over the years. Some of it was inevitable. With the Internet more accessible than ever, it's understandably difficult to create a sense of mystery. The late 90s and early 2000s were a different time, and a lot of the experiences people remember simply can't be recaptured because they were exclusive and dependent to that time and the limitations of technology of the day.

However, I'd say the mindset of the industry itself has shifted. A focus on mass appeal is clearly more prevalent. In fairness, the market being catered to has also shifted significantly since 2002 due to the reasons above and others, such as games being seen as an equivalent entertainment medium to cinema and TV instead of just a nerdy pastime. Companies like Bethesda are just doing what corporations do by changing their strategy. I'm not trying to excuse any of their actions in recent years, I'm just illustrating that it's all par for the course.

That's not what I'm here to discuss, though.

Morrowind is truly Bethesda at their finest. It's an experience like no other, from an era when innovation and creativity were strong in the gaming industry. In my opinion, the developers didn't seem to be attempting to please anyone aside from themselves. This doesn't feel at all like the product of an unfeeling corporation, as many more modern games do to an extent (in my opinion).

When you get off that boat in Seyda Neen, you are a pathetic nobody. A weakling dressed in rags. You suck at everything, including walking. You will be awkwardly ""hobbling"" (to use a generous term) around for a good chunk of the early game. 

This game doesn't hand you anything, but if you're willing to put the effort into learning its systems and rules, there are no limits to what you can accomplish. The design of the game blurs the line between features and exploits in the best possible way. I'm not exaggerating when I say for any frustration you have with the gameplay, there is a way around it. Trust me, by the end of your playthrough, you'll be something very different from the filthy prisoner nobody you start out as.

You literally become a God. Similar to the Dragonborn arc in Skyrim, but much more epic and executed in a much more satisfying way.

[b]Little advice[/b]
The beginning of the game can be frustrating and slow. STICK WITH IT. Don't be afraid to toggle off auto-run and cautiously approach enemies, especially early in the game. That green fatigue bar is deceptively important. The higher your fatigue, the better chance you have of hitting an enemy, casting a spell, or doing literally anything else.

[i] You're on your own now. Good luck.[/i]"
The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"The best elder scrolls game imo. Why?

tl;dr Dark elf Jesus goes around doing task for Imperial daddy while taking narcotics.

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"Despite preceding Oblivion and Skyrim, Morrowind is deeper and more fantastical than both in many ways. The mysterious, mushroom filled world of Morrowind looks nothing like the forests and mountains of Cyrodiil and Skyrim to a benefit, dropping you in a true world of fantasy. Its age, having been released in 2002, definitely shows throughout the gameplay, and to a more tolerable extent, the graphics. Regardless of its traditional approach to RPG combat (dice rolls), there is never a shortage of things to do within this amazing world: quests, guilds, dungeons, exploration, and of course, a harrowing storyline in classic Elder Scrolls fashion of saving the world. If you are a fan of the series and haven't played Morrowind, I would definitely recommend it. If the graphics aren't bearable, mods can bring it up to a passable standard; while janky at first, the combat will improve as you get to used to it and as you level."

DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"Great Game in all honesty, What killed it for me is the Card Warriors. I spent $50 in game for the coins to purchase cool items not knowing there is a bug that makes it impossible for you to play the card warriors game anymore, it would of been nice if they knew this is a ongoing bug to either disable the purchases or have a warning screen when entering the store. So i lost out of $50 and can not play it at all now. Emailed them and waiting for a response, Until this is sorted or i receive a refund i will not be changing my rating.

DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"The only thing that pushed me to 100% this game was my love and appreciation for Dragon Ball. 

It was not worth the effort.

While the DBZ story is intact and playing out the events of it is pretty fun, that's where the pros end. This game doesn't really deliver on any other front. The combat becomes samey very quickly, the side quests are bland and uninteresting, the open world has a very random design and does not ask to be explored like other open world RPGs. If you do end up choosing to explore it, you won't be very well rewarded or entertained. The community system I only ever ended up doing for the achievement, as doing it in between story beats felt like a waste of time. The meal system I only ever used a few times outside doing the achievement, and while more useful than the community system, getting to actually make a meal is grindy and annoying.

If you're a heavily devoted DB fan, this game will still probably please you enough to produce enjoyment, but if you're a non-DB fan looking to experience the events of DBZ's story through this game, save your money"
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,a MUST have for DBZ fans
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"This game has good story. That's probably the only high mark I can give it.

I refunded the game shortly after given control of Piccolo when the realization came of what I'd be doing 90% of the time. Flying around collecting orbs with finicky flight controls and needing to be quite close to pick up said orbs. After failing miserably to a timed collection challenge thing I'd have seen enough. 
The fighting mechanics didn't hold me either. Goku and Piccolo have multiple supers from what I gleaned from the Super moves skill tree, but you can only bring 4 to a fight and the orb collecting is what's needed to unlock and power them up.
This game does not respect your time, that's all I can say. It doesn't deliver as an RPG or a Fighting game, both areas are equally weak!"
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"This game is real dumb. Made for 10 year old children, not actual Dragonball fans who are now 30+ years old."
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"This is one of those games where playing on a binge would burn you out quick. Story is a much more washed out version of the original anime and gameplay is so repetitive that you could probably beat the game blindfolded while mashing exactly 3 buttons. A game's art style can only keep your attention for so long.

If you're playing for just the story, it's not worth the trouble unless you just need to get up to speed without wanting to spend too much time on the anime.

If you're playing for the gameplay, this game doesn't have much to offer and is very grindy in the worst of places. Your call.

Simplicity is something many games struggle to do but some do it too well. This game is an example of the latter.

DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"The game is amazing. Must have for any fan of the series. Since you play on PC, you have to set icons, so that tutorials and other things will be shown for PC players instead of consols. This is how you do it:

DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"We all know the story, and its told once again with great graphics and decent gameplay. Its got a cringe slow start but picks up after a bit. I like games with a narrative with some open ended busy work and this has both.

A few things that bother the hell outta me is:

 1. i have to turn on vsync to stop tearing but it locks my 60fps monitor to 30fps. 

 2. is that All-Might voices like 4 people which wouldnt be a big deal since ya know, skyrim, but when you have 3 of the 4 people talking in the same cutscene, its funny in a lame way. 

and a big one, 3. I have watched team fourstar's abridged about 7 times and its reeaally hard to go back to vanilla characters. Especially vegita. so if we could get a TFS DLC that would epic. Or at the very least a krillin owned counter.

All seriousness, the game isnt bad. The combat is pretty same ol same ol but it still feels good and the graphics and world are top tier. I was on the fence about refunding it because like i said the intro was so childishly cringe worthy that it took two senzu's to shake off. Im looking forward to cell saga but again, gonna miss the abridged version."
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"It's a really good game. Specially if you're a DBZ fan. You will visit iconic places, meet characters and also know more about DBZ lore in general. It's up to you, to enjoy this game."
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,GREAT dragon ball game and great game if you have never watch dragon ball. Super fun and would totally buy it again 10/10
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"My only real complaint with this game is the combat. It isn't fun at all. It looks cool as all hell, but it just feels bad to play. The only thing that I need for a DBZ game to do in order to be a decent game is for it to make the combat system fun to play. Kakarot does not do this at all. For all of the things that it does correctly, it failed miserably at the most important aspect of a DBZ game.

The controls feel stiff, clunky, and awkward. Some of that can be mitigated by changing up the control scheme on your own, but it still doesn't feel smooth or intuitive no matter what you do, and there are certain mechanics to it that just isn't very good. It feels frustrating and tedious, as if it was intentionally designed to not be any fun. In the short time that I've spent with the game, obviously, I haven't completely mastered the combat system. However, I don't think that matters. This doesn't feel like something you just need to ""git gud"" at. It feels like some annoying chore that you just have to put up with because you have no other choice. That is not quality game design."
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,So this might come as a shocker to most but I have never seen one episode of DBZ and not knowing anything about the rich lore this game explains so much. I was looking for a game with good combat that was on sale because I'm cheap and this game did not disappoint.

DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"game nice game very nice also kinda nice really nice and nice,good game"
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"The only good thing about this game is flying around the map. Everything else is either mid to horrible. The story is negligible its dragon ball. Every good compliment I can give this game comes crashing down in burning mess because of one thing. The battle system.
Absolutely without a shadow of a doubt the most horrible, absolute abysmal combat system I've ever seen. It has the grounds to be really really good but fails at the very start. Every single enemy, even the level 1 enemy, the insignificant enemies, have super armour, or hyper armour. What this means is if they glow red, you cannot stun them or knock them back. Seems fine until you realize they can go into their hyper armour state at any time. to that case, they can do their hyper armour supers at any time. Whether or not your mid combo. the only time you can get them out of this state is to break their stamina. However, when in hyper state, they recover their stamina, so any amount of damage you dealt is now being recovered back. If you hit them, you get punished. if your mid combo and they decide to go hyper, your punished. Its even more evident when theres multiple enemies, which 60% of the time there's 2-5 enemies. You have no control over the other enemies your fighting. your locked onto 1 enemy and anything the other enemies do is practically unstoppable. Take the vegeta training area. If your locked onto 1 enemy, raditz and nappa can both do their super, they can both go into their hyper states, and they can both double fuck you no matter what and you cant do anything because You have no hyper armour. Theres no way to protect you against an onset of blasts or melee attacks. Because, one thing the game teaches you to do, is to guard. If you guard to much it breaks your stamina. Just so happens the usual multi hit attacks are just enough to break your guard, to which they can do anything. 
This game has the most punishing, unfulfilling, unsatisfactory combat I have ever seen in any game. When you do get a combo off that 20% of the time and it does maybe 1-1.5 health bars to which they get their stamina back and repeat the process over again. Ive havent even gotten into the repetative nature of the system. every enemy has 3-4 supers they will always spam. early on in the game in vegeta training mode, raditz's only move would be his multi blasts attack. The only option you have is to back/dash to the side. then you can hit him and start a combo right? No. he assumes he hyper armour state. This is every enemy. Some are better than other. I will admit, When the combat isnt hemorrhoid inducing agitating, the combat is actually very fun. Stringing together attacks and super along with support characters is very very very enjoyable. It actually feels amazing. Then you get sucked into the repatative loop that lasts far too long and honestly is not worth playing at all. 

Other people complaints are that after the frieza saga, they cut content, it lacks life, theres nothing to do, and in all honesty, yes that is the case, but its mostly meant to be you explore the dragon ball world with rpg-ish elements with a atb combat system. This game is meant for people who have seen the show/read the manga. It just feels like it shouldve had a beta, and worked on for a few more months. Exploring the world, talking to characters, doing shit is actually enjoyable. When the combat doesnt fuck you its really entertaining. The beginning of the game has a lot of charisma and is great. After frieza saga it goes heavily down. cell, buu, all feel bad. and the combat only gets worse. Please do yourself a favour and watch/read the series. The game really isnt worth it. My rating went from a 8-9 to a 7-8 to borderline 4-5. Solely based on whatever redeeming qualities there were or blasted away at the horrendeous combat. 70% of the game is the combat. Its terrible. This game is a Joke."
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"Kakarot is a game that looks nice, but is boring as hell. Following the style of Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 cutscenes are a mixture of text, 3D models chatting w/ voice acting and the actual rare great looking cutscene CC2 is known for.

DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,This is an amazing Hearthstone clone and they added some sort of Story Mode RPG on top of that.
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,I'm just a Dragonball fan who loves to relive the adventure.
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,Now don't get me wrong the game is good but you can't use a keybored you have to use a xbox or ps4 controller i don't have anything wrong with that its just when i use my ps4 controller for some reason the controls are xbox???? idk why they are but they are.  the dlc with the super sayian god form doesn't work it just frezzes when you defeat berris so its not really worth it.
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"Hour after hour I keep playing this game. I think just to justify my purchase. Its just not good. Yes it is a nostalgia run. But the fights are beyond annoying. You are either fighting cookie cutter mobs that run you down in the open world or bosses that have no limit to the abilities they can cast as well as extra moves that assist them further. Your only option is to overlevel your character and slap them around. Which is kind of a boring grind to do. The bosses will ""little brother"" you. By that, I mean they will use their same couple moves over and over and over again. Stunning or guard breaking you. The dodge system is what is cool but either it doesnt work or my brain doesnt. You will also get 3v1d constantly in training and 5-8 v 1 a lot in the open world. This game should be good. The graphics are cool and the effects when fighting are sweet. I dont even mind the empty open world littered with repetitive mobs that much. In all honesty if they made the AI a bit more unique in its fighting style it would be more fun."

DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"After sinking 50 hours into this game, I've got to say it is one of the most fun games I've played. I purchased all of the DLC with it and while I was not a fan of how the first 2 dlc's were handled, the future trunks DLC was quite nice. I like this game so much in fact I ended up getting all the achievements both on here and on my playstation. 

Though some of the ""Sub Stories"" are quite repetitive, whether it be a ""go find this and bring it back"" or ""find this and fight some enemies and bring it back"", they were tolerable enough I didn't mind doing all of them. 

The only thing I dislike about the game is that you are not able to free roam as vegito, as well as once you get to the end game, unless you have the DLC's that allow you to complete the training's with Whis in order to get the items that allow you to instantly level up your character, leveling everyone up to a decent level or keeping them on par with the main characters you play can be a bit obnoxious.

Overall though, I do recommend this game!"
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"Loved it!  The animations are awesome, particularly during the cutscenes.  However, this title gets an 8/10 from me simply because of all the random encounters whilst flying around the map.  I get the reasoning of having these random NPCs all over the place but after three encounters with essentially the same mob(s), it's painstakingly boring.  Other than that, a great title.  Definitely wait for it to go on sale and spring for the DLCs"
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,If you love Dragonball this is a really fun game that actually has some emotional moments as you experience Goku's life
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!! I love db dbz and dbs and this game just sums up everything i like 1. Good Story 2. Open World 3. Takes very long to complete 4. AND ITS DRAGON BALL Z ! Amazing game guys keep the good work up

DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,My son and I played this game just after watching Dragon Ball Super. It was the best time we've had in video games together. And the first game he completed. He would handle the story and I would handle all the background upgrades and training. My son and I are very excited about the DLC. I can easily recommend this game to any fan of the series.
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,10/10 would beat
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,I like how the game looks.
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"Really cool DBZ game. Reminds me of the GBA saga ""The Legacy of Goku"". Yeah, you have to do all the sagas again in a DBZ game, but this is a wellmade RPG approach."
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"KA...ME...HA...ME...., il leave the rest to you. =)"
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"10/10 game, I think its definitely worth the buy. The cut scenes are beautifully animated and a great way to almost watch the series again in an interactive way. In terms of game play I feel like they could have cut back on the amount of random encounters while traveling in the open world other than that, a very solid game that wont make you lose your mind like Dark souls but just challenging enough to keep it entertaining. 

Still playing through atm of review but am 100% buying DLC as soon as i finish the story solely because I love the animation style and am excited to see more of the Iconic DB moments reanimated."

TOTALLY TRANSCENDENT

HARDCORE TO THE MEGA"
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"While a lot of the political stuff flew over my head, the story, characters, lore, and writing overall mesmerized me. I was never one for CRPGs but this game has sold me on the genre. I've fallen in love with this game, and more people need to play it.
The devs have talent for writing and I really hope we get a sequel/prequel/spiritual successor from them in the near future."
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"TLDR: I highly recommend watching the first 30mins of actual gameplay on youtube before buying this game.

This is a VERY niche game and definitely not for everyone. Like many others, I fell into the trap of buying this game based on the multitude of 10/10 critic reviews, awards and beautiful screenshots. I tried to like this game, but towards the end, I honestly didn't care what happened to the protagonist anymore. I just wanted to finish the game for completeness. 

Progress in this game is almost 100% via dialogue. Most of this dialogue, especially in the beginning, is world building. Tedious information about social, economic and political structures of Revachol. I now know more about Revachol than I do about my hometown. The rest of the dialogue occurs within your mind. This was much more enjoyable. This was where the character building and role-playing takes place, and the options are very entertaining.

Where this game ultimately fails is that there are hard stops to progress based on your attributes. I was lucky I still had side quests to complete that allowed me to earn enough xp and level that particular attribute. Otherwise you would have to reload and get lucky with the dice roll, killing the immersion. 

To list the other aspects...
Pros:
- Artwork: amazing stylised art
- Voice acting: amazing, but seeing how the game is 100% dialogue, this has to be good.
- Freedom: to handle situations any way you want (with the exception of those hard stops, which really screw the game)
- Music: very good, and compliments the game well.

Con (just one, but it's major):
- Story: honestly I found the plot boring and frustrating. Revachol might as well be any country that has undergone a revolution. Nothing new here. The main plot is frustrating because everyone is just screwing with you. I was hopeful the personal plot would be something amazing, but was anticlimactic. By the end of the game, I was bored out of my mind. 

I cannot recommend this game to the average gamer. I repeat, this game is VERY niche.
Personally, I would get more satisfaction from reading a good book."
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,My necktie began talking to me and became a plot-integral character.
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"Disco Elysium is easily one of my favourite games. It's Incredibly unique and compelling - with a beautiful art style, superbly written and incredibly engaging. Messing up is actively encouraged - making choices feels truly impactful and worthwhile, albeit on a more personal level - rather than following a simplified 'paragon' vs 'renegade' or similarly binary path. I first played through this early December 2020 and have constantly found myself wanting to come back and start another play through where I do something completely different than the last two times.

How you choose to investigate the murder (or even IF you choose to investigate it) are completely up to the player's discretion. You can be a hard boiled no-nonsense authoritarian, a judicious and fair investigator, an intimidating renegade cop, a smooth talking manipulator, sly and wily seducer, or any other type of person justified in the game's 24 different skills in the skill tree. All the while these skills will constantly be tested and rolled against like a traditional RPG with dice rolling mechanics. Your individual path to success or ""failure"" will depend on what mix of skills, attributes, and equipment you choose. 

The musical ambiance is subtle but atmospheric, and the beautifully drawn backgrounds and environments are a joy to wander around. You truly feel like you're in a dilapidated seaside down on the verge of consuming itself. The art in this game is absolutely incredible to the point where I NEED a physical art book just so I can stare at it for hours.
 
Disco Elysium really sinks into your subconscious and lingers there, whispering and murmuring to you about the transient nature of reality, whilst reminding you not to be afraid to sing karaoke, get drunk, make a fool of yourself, and go hunting for imaginary stick-insects just for the fun of it.

This game really isn't for everyone as a lot of people have already mentioned. Just watch at least 30 minutes of gameplay before deciding if it's your thing or not."

Disco Elysium is a fantastic game. It is a text heavy and fully voiced RPG. It's one of those games you'd wish you'd forget just so you could play it again. It's really one of it's kind. Absolutely recommend it. The writing is top notch, and it really shows. It felt extremely satisfying by the end, seeing all of the pieces fall into place. Also goes to note that his is one game where I felt like your choises actually mattered. I've reloaded a couple of saves just out of curiosity, and the changes in the story can be *drastic*. Definitely going to revisit this in the future once its not so fresh out of my head trying out a different character build."

This game makes you stop to burst unstoppable laughs or extreme anger, brings existential sadness, questions your political and moral views, imprints all its magnificent soundtracks in your head and many more. With the help of a down-to-earth partner, you build your own detective, your own adventure, so that then walk away from the story a better person or with at least some food for thought, which is a pretty rare outcome considering modern games."

Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"If you like classic RPGs such as Planescape where the world around you, the dialogues, the choices and the consequences they have are what gives you your fix and sense of immersion, this game is an absolute must-play.

The lack of combat could definitely turn a lot of otherwise RPG fans off so be aware of that."
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"It's a really great and unique game. The way too the end and its many interesting dialogues with remarkable people are the stars. 

Sadly the end is the weakest and disappointing part of the game."
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"I keep fighting the urge to replay this game and tell myself that it’s because I’ll enjoy it the more I wait and forget details of the story.  The truth is I’m afraid that if I play through it again it will dispel some of the magic and it won’t mean the same thing to me any more.

It was that much of an experience for me."
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"quite possibly the best game i've ever played. as someone who's attended my fair share of creative writing classes, paying attention to how this game is written will likely get you a comparable level of competency as will a degree. incredibly well spoken politically, sees the world with perfect vision and gives you the tools to navigate through it, even if it's not quite our world. as someone who wasn't interested in CRPGs, isometric gameplay or most anything presented here, i think i've done myself a great service by getting it. PLAY THIS GAME. every moment you spend playing this game, learning, toying with what it presents is a moment you're spending growing as a person, and that's infinitely more than i can say for the days upon weeks i've spent shooting people on call of duty. i can semi-confidently say that after playing, i think i'm unironically a better person for having experienced it, lmao. very likely life-changing. as well as being infinitely quotable, so if this game doesn't touch you in that way, at least you'll have a good time. worth every penny at full price, maybe even more. incredibly excited to see where this developer and these writers will go after this project. thank you for this game"

This is a very very good game if you enjoy poking into weird corners of the world, gnawing your way through trivia to find the awful truth, and experiencing wonder and horror. I want to give myself a few months to forget and then play again so I can make differently bad choices next time. Money well spent."
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"This game is an excellent combination of narrative-driven RPG, detective stories and magical realism, while still being more than the sum of its parts. The new addition of full voice acting is the last step to make this game a perfect recommendation for anyone.

"
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"I could talk about this game for hours on end and still not have said enough. If you like RPGs, you will probably love this game. In a game where even saying the main character's name is a minor spoiler and your necktie is a major character, there's just a whole lot going on. 

Instead of going on forever, I'll leave you with a cool mechanical example of some of the stuff this game does. 

Your stats are all voices in your head, when you roll using a stat, that stat will talk to you in your head. Your highest stats will obviously come up more in your head, but also affect the dialogue choices you can say. So a playthrough with a focus on Encyclopedia as a primary stat will make it so your character is a fountain of trivia, sometimes unable to help himself from peppering it into conversation. Sometimes your character's greatest strengths will be so loud to a point of actually holding your character back. Like how Electrochemistry will probably tell you to do some very dumb things to get a quick fix. 

The game is very smart, super interesting, and Kim Kitsuragi is the best video game companion ever. 

Just play it, you're welcome in advance."
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,Beautiful game!
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"Back in the days, I used to play all the Lucasarts and Sierra adventure games, and I've been missing the feeling those games used to awaken in me. So many games nowadays are focused on twitchy reflexes and point-and-shoot mechanics, and I've missed these walk-and-talk games where a world unfolds around you. Disco Elysium is that game, and I couldn't be happier."
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"This is the most innovative RPG since the times of Fallout and Planescape Torment. Forget the elves, the kings, and the magic. Forget the repetitive combat. Playing as an alcoholic detective who's talking to himself on the verge of a total collapse, now how cool is that? Lots of dark humor, lots of deep psychological stuff. This game makes you laugh, then occasionally makes you sad or reflective. Add some caricature representations of the political landscape - you can even quit the detective work to pursue a career in politics and become a useless bureaucrat.
It's OK to fail. In fact, if you're a perfectionist who succeeds at everything by save scamming, you might want to replay the game by failing at every possible step. You'd be missing much of the writing if you avoid failure.
Only one complaint - there's too little of it. It's only 50 hours per playthrough. You can easily enjoy it 2 times though, unlike many other games - so it's around a 100 hours of gameplay. It's kind of the opposite of the No Man's Sky where you can easily sink in hundreds of hours building your perfect starship for no reason. Here, the balance is tipped in the other direction - you're getting an abundance of meaning squeezed into a relatively short time frame.
This game is a work of art."

Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"A very unique RPG, with an incredibly fleshed out world/lore. Possibly the best prose I have ever read in a video game is accentuated by flawless voice acting for every character. The game can be a little slow paced, and it relies a lot upon your intrigue into the politics of its world. If these philosophical discussions don't interest you, I imagine this game won't interest you either. If you think you would like a melancholy, philosophical, and emotional game, this experience will certainly be gratifying."

We got a Code 31!
Officer in need of assistance... On the dance floor!"
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,probably the most Immersive RPG your going  to find.  I played the original and loved it but  the fact that every line is voiced now makes this game  a masterpiece  10/10
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"Where to even begin. I guess I'll just start at the beginning...
Disco Elysium starts off by immediately making the player feel uncomfortable. The creepy voices of your limbic system and ancient lizard brain are haunting and the first scenes immediately throws you off balance and makes you ask ""What the hell is this?!"". It invokes the perfect emotional response to the experience your character is having. As you struggle to come to grips with the world, so does your character. 

The story is engaging in its own right but on another level it's also the perfect story for a game. Who are you? Nobody knows. That is for you to figure out and decide as you play the game. Your character is a blank canvas and you get to paint whatever picture you want on that canvas.
It's simply brilliant that the game is able to give you so many real world ways in which to mould exactly who you are. On top of that it's an extremely rich world, filled with an amazing amount of lore and detail. Everything truly comes to life in this, one of the most well written stories and fleshed out worlds I've ever encountered. More important than all that though is the fact that the story is HONEST. It's not afraid to highlight some of the darkest parts of humanity, on an individual level and as a species and it does so, not in some fantastical ""Dark elves, and evil dragons"" kind of way, but in a way we can relate to in every day life. Things are bad in Disco Elysium's world, especially the town where the game takes place, not because some inherent evil makes it so, but because of people's weaknesses, because of the incentives placed before them, because our political systems are flawed, and because people are products of those systems. 

Gameplay wise the game has one of the most innovative skill trees of any RPG I've ever played. Most importantly it also ties perfectly into the detective noire style story and the world, and seeing as this isn't your average fantasy or sci-fi story you're presented with something totally fresh and unique.
If the game has a weakness it's in its gameplay though. It doesn't really have any combat, which is actually perfect for the kind of detective adventure it is, but this means the ""challenge"" mostly comes from dialogue rolls against your skills, this can sometimes feel a bit random, leaving you sometimes getting extremely unlucky and failing a roll that you had an 87% or even 97% chance of succeeding in. A lot of story content and mystery lies behind the success of these rolls, so of course the game heavily incentivises the player to utterly exploit the quick save and quick load functionality of the game... Which, in turn, basically removes all challenge from the game. In short, if you're looking for a challenging RPG, this might not be the one for you. This is true for almost any RPG though, so you can't really judge the game too harshly for this.
If, however, you're looking for refreshingly unique story and a world you can get lost in then look no further.

The game is so much. It's hauntingly beautiful water colour visuals, clever writing and bold exploration of everything from politics to insanity guarantees a unique introspective experience that will leave anyone feeling totally immersed and mentally enriched for having played it. This game is truly a work of art and is the stuff all games should be made of.

Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,Just let me marry Kim plsssssssssss.
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,Simply the bestest and most touching game I've played in years.
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"An incredible RPG blending political ideology, mental illness, and a murder mystery, all taking place in the setting of an impoverished, war-torn district of an island nation after a failed communist revolution. Most of the gameplay involves expansive dialogue trees and investigation, where skills such as ""Empathy,"" ""Shivers,"" ""Suggestion,"" and ""Inland Empire"" are represented in the form of voices speaking within the player character's thoughts, advising him all at once, and sometimes to cross purposes. 

Disco Elysium's setting is hauntingly beautiful, and a sense of loss and foreclosed possibilities permeates the game. The history and politics of the world seamlessly blend with the psychology and dispositional traits of the main character seamlessly, in an intelligent and ironic way that makes plot developments intriguing and captivating. There are a number of dream sequences throughout the game that change depending upon your actions and whether your outlook favors one of several distinct philosophies (e.g. Mazovian socioeconomics, Revacholian nationalism, the humanism of the Moralintern, etc.).

The language and writing within the game are highly evocative. Some key features I happen to remember: ""with blood smelling like strawberries,"" the glowing lungs of Dolores Dei that are a metaphor for both religion and love, the ragged sadness and bitter authenticity of Klassje's relationship with a member of a paramilitary occupational force, and, of course, the apricot scent of a lover.

 Disco Elysium is the first example I can think of where a video game  clearly stands out as a powerful work of art."

Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"While I did enjoy the game, I didn't *love* it quite like a lot of people seem to have. There's a lot to love in the game; the voice acting, the art, the characters, the world building but there are also things that I didn't like. I was never a fan of the skill point system and felt it got in the way. I can certainly see how being able to go for different builds would add replayability to a genre that is usually a play-once kind of thing but it felt more like an inconvenience and having to change clothes to maximise your chances at individual check marks was irritating with a bad UI for changing what you have equipped. There is a point in the game where you *have* to win one of two rolls and if you fail them and have exhausted all other threads in the game so can't get any more skill points then you can't get any further. You'll likely have to roll back to an old save and reload until you pass one of the rolls.

The biggest thing I didn't like about the game though was how it's usually quite depressing. There are moments of what feel like genuine warmth in the game but they are fleeting and while you have a few choices on how you want your Harry to be, they're all quite depressing. Don't play this game if you're depressed.

One thing I'll add is that the latest release adds a story line which is one of four options depending on what kind of choices your Harry has made. I enjoyed it but had to reload my particular one a couple of times because I needed some high skill points to pass some check points in order to not fail it, which was annoying and once you finish it, the game ends, which felt odd. I had to reload a save and ignore it as I finished the main game."
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,Very Goog
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"Short Version: Buy this at full price, you'll enjoy it.

Now the long version: I loved this game. LOVED it. Start to finish, it was a fantastic experience, and that's a rarity with games I play. There was never anything that felt grindy or inconsequential to the overall narrative. Some of it was frustrating, but only because the check-based system is not something that I'm used to. And, even in those frustrating moments - when you miss a red check that you REALLY wanted to pass - the story keeps going. There's almost always a way around.

As for that narrative: you need to be okay reading. There is voice acting, and the voice acting is good, but I still ended up reading more of the text - particularly the descriptive text that isn't voiced. The good news is that it's a really, really good narrative. When I started, I thought it was all going to be played for laughs. But, I was surprised by how much the game MOVED me. There were moments when my heart broke, particularly as a recovering alcoholic and someone who struggles with mental illness. I won't go into more detail, because it is something that you need to experience yourself - and, with the skills and check-based system, your experience will be completely different.

To reiterate: this game is absolutely worth a full-price purchase. You will laugh, you will wince, and you might even wipe away a tear or two. And, you will fall in love."

If you are intelligent, have a decent reading age and are capable of following intricate and complex themes and characters depicted in beautiful writing, then this is the game for you.

Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"I'm writing this as I'm starting my second playthrought of this amazing game. In the first 3 minutes I failed to pick up my tie and ended up having a small heart attack costing me 1 hp.
I wasn't sure about how useful voice dubbing would be but it's actually great and really well done. This game is unique, well written and a masterpiece.

After finishing my second playthrough, I can confidently say this is one of the best if not THE best RPG ever made. A true lesson in narrative design and a masterful piece of art."

Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"After two playthroughs of the game, one on the original version and one after The Final Cut, I can wholeheartedly recommend this to anybody interested in RPGs or in story-driven games in general. Disco Elysium has some of the best writing I've ever seen in a video game.

It's hard to recommend exactly what I love about this game without getting into spoiler territory. In fact, the game is best played completely blind. If you're looking for a quick bite of what the story is about, plenty of other reviews have done that work already. Just play it."

Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"People often complain that games have terrible narratives. Disco Elysium not only surpasses other games in that regard, I think it might be the best story in well, anything. It's the best story ever. And it's a game that I describe as ""Fallout but there's no combat."" So the game's all story, and that story's the best story ever.

It's funny, sad, poignant, and interesting. Does extreme justice to both the detective and narrative game genre. You can punch children, do hard drugs, talk to clothes, harass your eternally patient partner, run around yelling about immigrants, capitalism, the working class, the end times, and rare bugs, and watch your brain argue with itself.

And it was this great when I played it a year ago, then it added voice acting. And it is both superbly acted and probably the most perfectly cast voice actors I've ever heard."

For real though, this has to be the best game I played in 2021; it has an amazing political atmosphere that makes the entire world feel real, and it helped me reflect on our own political climate. I felt comforted by the absolute mess the main character is in. 

If you've played Pathologic HD/2, and haven't played this game, you're gonna love this game. If you thought Pathologic was too intense as a first person shooter game, this RPG style is definitely a lot more relaxing. There also isn't a lot of combat if you're not into that."

Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"The only reason to not buy this game is if you hate reading a lot. Everything else is stellar. The writing is good. If you've ever liked a book before, you'll probably like this game."
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"The actual content of this game is great! If, by some miracle, you are able to play this game, you will likely enjoy it.

The reason I can't recommend this game is because it only boots less than 10% of the time. It successfully loads a game save 60% of the time. It manages to not crash upon entering a door 50% of the time. I've set the game to lowest settings, and my PC is recommended spec. I have attempted opening the game in administrator mode, turning off the steam overlay, etc. Game still requires a miracle to boot.

That said, the game being as great as it happens to be is the only reason I tolerated a game that boots only 10% of the time. Well, that, and buying it way back when it was first released prohibited me from any attempt at getting a refund."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"This game is so Castlevania that it couldn't Castlevania any harder even if its name was Belmont. Very much a spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night/Rondo of Blood/Aria of Sorrow/Harmony of Dissonance. They've made major improvements on the 2-D series, not only to 2.5D graphics but the detail of the characters and the art is wonderful."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"A great game, but it does have it's flaws.

Gameplay is pretty solid and addictive. Making builds using the shards you find and seeing your stats go up from leveling up and finding items is pretty fun. The art direction is good, but the graphics themselves are meh - I think it would've helped to display character portraits during cutscenes instead of looking at the character models up close. 

As for the bad, starting from halfway through the game (unless you go for the bad ending). the way to progress can get a little too cryptic at times. And when you find the solution, it isn't an ""a-ha!"" feeling; it's more like ""how the hell was I supposed to figure that out,"". Miriam controls fine, but can't attack up or straight down, and moves a bit on the slower side (I find myself sliding around cause of this). Bosses attacks can be tricky to dodge because of this, and their hitboxes can be hard to make out. Miriam also has little iframes - leading to you getting combo'd by enemies and bosses (I understand they didn't want you to use them to cheese the game, but maybe some compromise could've been made). And lastly, the hub and dying take up way too much of your time. I find myself running back and fourth between the shop and alchemy area getting the resources I need, and it gets tedious. Same with the quests; they say the same lines every time, and you have to accept their quests for the progress to actually count or to let you know if you have what you need. Upon dying, the game flashes a game over screen before reloading your last save. Considering the game can restore enemies in a room on a whim, surely it can do the same for the player. Could save you some time especially if you find yourself dying a lot.

Despite all these issues I've had, I still recommend the game. I've heard they are working on a sequel so hopefully they take some of these issues into account. Oh, and I find that the game doesn't like Xbox 360 controllers - makes it stutter and lag. Use any other gamepad."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"Man Iga and his team really delivered on this game! 

I heard of castlevania games before but I never played them. I am more of a casual gamer too but I had fun with this game. I say it is a 20 hr game for the main story. I have 40 hrs cuz of another playthru. I also did not notice any technical issues in my playthrus. Now time to explain why I enjoy this game and my thoughts.

The gameplay is so addicting. Fighting bosses is really fun. when you get fked by them intially it feels grueling but then gratifying once you finally figure out how YOU beat it. I also love the weapon choice and shards aspect in the game. For me most weapons felt pretty on par with each other and was more about what playstyle suits you best. Though the boots felt kinda lackluster imo. There is much variety when it comes to shard builds to facilitate many playstyles. I really love the grinding to find materials and shards to make ur builds even better. Then seeing it all come together is so satisfying. When you start. I would suggest to try as many different shards to get a feel of what you like. That was something I regret not doing early on. Trying out different builds really adds to the game's already existing extreme replayability value. Different modes and another playable character(I believe they're adding more later).

The story was not breathtaking for me. However, it was enough to motivate me to explore the world to find out more. There are lore bits delivered thru journal logs for those curious about the game's world. Personally, I didn't feel like reading while playing. I rather just smack something :P. However, I prob would look into it now since I just finished it.

The art direction was superb imo. There was many moments where I would stop moving just to look at the environment. Or even die to enemies(mainly bosses) because I was too busy looking at their design. I took many screenshots especially when I got to sit in chairs in different locations. 

Man the music gets me bopping. Boss fight starts. *Music plays* stands still to focus on music and takes damage. But hey that soundtrack tho! My favorite has to be Gears of Fortune! I love it so much!! Bro like I'm listening to it looped as I'm writing this review. 

Thank you ArtpPlay for making this Gem! [spoiler]Also shout out to SilverKnight! Best Boi amirite [spoiler]"
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"I found this game to be pretty generic overall. The game is filled with muddy textures and bland monster designs. The boss fights lack any real depth or strategy, dodging for the most part is not necessary. The difficulty level is really low, great if you're looking for an easy game to pass the time with.

The best parts are the soundtrack and weapon / shard variety.

If you have played through many of the other metroidvania's on Steam this might be worth considering. Otherwise check out Hollow Knight or Ori first for a more engaging experience.

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,I just beat SOTN
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"I can probably count the number of game developers who came back from a decade-long hiatus on the fingers of one hand, let alone as much success and popularity as Koji Igarashi had garnered at the height of his career as a game developer. In an industry that's full of washed-up has-beens and frauds masquerading as creators - all of whom seem a tad too busy riding the coattails of their past glory to produce anything even mildly entertaining or creative, It's refreshing to see one creator that not only didn't succumb to the ravages of time, but rather silently honed his spirit and resolve, ultimately producing one of the finest games the genre has to offer.

Perhaps somewhat contrary to what has been said before, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night doesn't reinvent the wheel by any means. Nearly every mechanic in this game has been done before in previous titles that Koji had worked on, such as gravity flipping or soul collecting, except here it has been polished to a mirror shine. In essence, the same things that apply to previous games in the genre apply here too: The levels are large and sprawling and require a great deal of backtracking if one wishes to find all the extra bosses, loot, easter eggs, and general lore the game has to offer. The platforming is as good as it has ever been and the combat and boss encounters seem to be unique and memorable, as well as the myriad of colorful characters the game throws at you every now and then. The story isn't exactly revolutionary, but it gets the job done reasonably well. The Kickstarter promises that the developers said will come eventually are taking their sweet time to get here, but the ones that are already delivered seem to be well implemented and add a ton of replay value to what is already an impressively long game on its own.

In summary, there is no shortage of content here for pretty much any person of any skill level who happens to like action-platformers. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is what happens when egos aren't running out of control and there is enough freedom and willingness to listen to what fans of the genre had been wanting all along - an extremely rare event in today's industry even among crowdfunded projects."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"I haven't enjoyed my time with Ritual of the Night at all. It doesn't come anywhere near the great Igavanias from the past that it's attempting to channel. And it's not the lore or the new settings fault. It's the way it plays and feels that's lackluster. I haven't completed the game because it's such a slog, though I do hope to do so one day and hopefully come back to this review with something more positive to say. Despite all this, I can't give it a thumbs down. It's clearly a labor of love and an attempt at reclaiming a spot in the genre despite not having the Castlevania license. But being indie is no excuse for how poor the game feels - just look at the fantastic Hollow Knight. It was made by 3 people.

What's absolutely baffling, is that the 8-bit Curse of the Moon and its sequel are phenomenal games that catch that old school feeling perfectly, and even transcend it at times. I'd say skip this and play those games instead."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"Its all of Iga's greatness packed into another awesome game. If you enjoy the igavania castlevania games or the metroidvania 
genre in general you should definitely pick this up be it on sale or at full price, its more of the castlevania goodness that we all love."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,hard to put to words how nice/refreshing it is to play a game that's just pure and simple fun the whole way through and isn't full of time-wasting b.s. an absolute joy to play :)
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,I wanted something like the old Castelvania titles such as Dawn of Sorrow. Bloodstained: RotN is a fantastic modern reincarnation of those games. Easily becoming one of my favorite metdoidvanias.
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"A very good Metroidvania. Easy pick: if you like Castlevania, Malice Mizer and Harajuku gothic lolitas, this game is for you (even if not ALL of these!). Definitely not a GREAT Metroidvania, but a very pleasant one. It starts very lightly (and too easily), but picks up eventually, even had to level up 5 ranks at the end to beat the game more surely. The map is quite big and the music is oldschool/90s. Sadly enemies are a bit too repetitive and the plot/story is really mediocre, with obvious plot twists... The overall style is weird and uselessly very modern-Japanese (uni and manju mixed with Gackt, pet dogs/cats, princess coach and Baby Metal...) but for the price, and for 20 hours, a good, though easily forgettable Castlevania tribute!

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"I bought the game for three things: the amazing graphics, Iga kicking it in the trailers and mostly because I didn't get a chance to play CSOTN. I owned it on PS but dismissed it because it felt like a step back when I ran the game for the first time (it was an old school game even back then!), I was wrong and it were my college roommates who unlocked the potential of it, they discovered the street fighter like techniques, how familiars became little floating killer machines and they were wowed when the castle turned upside down while I wowed as well in the back row (there were the occasional rumbles when someone used or saved over someone else's file). 
So I came with those expectations tothis game. I have to say I was a little dissapointed, I had just got The Vagrant, another metroidvania here on Steam, and loved the animations and combos, and just like with CSOTN i felt like a stepback, this supposedly great game couldn't even get this simple animations with simple attacks, but this time I kept playing, and then my RPG TOC kicked in, I got double jump, broke a wall, got better armor, built weapons in the shop, found an underwater stage I couldn't access early on, but I was sure I would get the item if I kept looking... In sum: I loved it. Be mindful though! there are things that could be deal breakers if you're not used to ultra cryptic conditions for game progress like in really really old school games, I honestly could see myself rage quitting this game had internet not existed, and I'm not talking about sidequests, but the main game: how about needing a library ID, which you have to get from a tertiary character who is completely unrelated to the plot, in order to get aboard a train. Really if you're stuck check yt. ps. I was kind of dissapointed that familiars never became little floating killer machines in this game."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"An overall solid metroidvania game. I will admit that I did get lost multiple times throughout the playthrough, but it's thankfully not too difficult to figure out. An overall solid title!"

Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,Good and enjoyable game. Recommend to anyone
Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,very good veri gut
Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"A very good roguelike dungeon crawler game. Graphics are cool, and runs without bugs. 

The concept is simple in appearence: player must adventure into ruins, dungeons, caves, and forest with groups of until four characters, each one with different skills, habits and equipment. Is the classic of the Dungeon Crawler genre, but all variable factors have been so deeply developed that turns product in something original and really interesting to play.

The mechanics of roguelike is very well implemented, strongly based on probabilities calculations developed to be balanced but against player, so he must compesate this disadvantage with luck, intelligence and perseverance. The remarkable depiction of foes, enviroments and lore contributes largely to the success of the whole.

Gameplay is a defiant, fun and well rewarded effort by its great amount of random and customizable things, there are many combinations of characters, skills and items to choose and foes and bosses to beat, all shown with a quality visual ambientation for a terror story, without forget fair maths that liyng behind.

This game demands high tolerance for frustration. Player is warned, by a notice before every starting, that he surely will loss characters permanently. Warning: this will happen surely, and many times, is really true. Heroes are free for recruit, but few arrives to town at once and player must to wait to class that he wants, and then train and equipt him, so he must to spend resources inmediatly to fix that.

Finish the campaign with all DLCs just depends on how many time player wants to spend enhancing their hero characters, literally there is no average or limit time. For a reference, 260 hours for 66% achievements...

Try to buy in special offers and sales."
Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"After over 200 hours in this game, I can say without a doubt that 80% of the time spent in it was to farm in the hope that I would level up Heroes and that they wouldn't die in the last combat of the dungeons because that happens a lot. Your progression in-game stops quite fast, and you feel like your doing countless runs without any end on the horizon. After around 60 hours, I turned off all the sounds in the game and started doing something else while farming countless dungeons. In conclusion, I felt that game wasn't fun; it was a chore."
Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,love the game all i gotta say i think there should be a limit to how this game screws you the rng is god or the devil himself 10/10 love when i get crits hate when i get critted
Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"Unistalled after 2 full team wipes. Will try again in a year or so.
Will update this review then."
Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"If you looking for something Horror like, but difficult by default then this is your game, I personally beat it once vanilla but prefer some mods that change the game up and ease off the intentionally hard RNG, (it is really rigged for you to get the lower end of the deal).

It is a great game, I feel like the rigged bad chances as well as the intentional limited inventory are done to slow you down Unnecessarily and create stress that really is not needed for the horror game.  I understand what they intended with it, but not my cup of tea, as you can have alot of grinding (if not on limited time mode) to fix bad rng moments. So with mods, I have seriously enjoyed the game, and recommended it even more so if you do use mods. I dont use overpowered mods, i only use those that double inventory space, and change up a few balance issues. You could use more powerful if you want, but I limited them to fixing or adding to the game, several class mods really enhance the game.

In the end, with mods, this game is amazing, without mods, its a mini dark souls that could use some adjustments but overall still good."
Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"Darkest Dungeon is one of those rare games I buy reluctantly on sale and later wish I had paid more for it.

It's a game that players will either love or hate, generally citing the same reasons, neither party being incorrect.
Obviously I'm of the ""love it"" party, but any pro for one person may be a con for another with this game.

I was skeptical about the game and put off playing it for quite a long time, but eventually picked it up and found it wasn't half as harsh as its reputation would suggest(until it is), while being every bit as gratifying as I'd heard.
The game is actually far more casual than I'd expected. Not exactly inviting to a casual audience, but while fights are brutal and can turn on their head with a single bad idea or coin flip, almost nothing is a permanent loss. Despite often being regarded as a ""rogue-like"", there are is fail state unless you're playing on the hardest difficulty(don't, it's for loonies). Losing battles can be abandoned, recovered from and attempted later. Lost equipment can be reclaimed. Lost heroes can be replaced, but never forgotten.

Like any moderately difficult game, failure is an important part of success, and as such you probably need a good sense of humor about cascade failure and getting screwed over to properly enjoy this game.
Over time you'll form strategies to effectively counter the painful RNG.
RNG is present in most any RPG, but in most cases it's fairly easy to ignore.
In Darkest Dungeon, it's an emotional rollercoaster and one of the greatest dividers of opinion, because combat is fast(as a turn-based game can be) and harsh, victory never assured even with the best odds.
The game tells you right away that it's about making the best of bad situations, and that is it exactly.
There is no describing the feeling of missing an 80% accuracy swing for the third turn in a row, being crit'ed to 0 HP(not death, by the way) and for the healer to then crit heal for 0 HP.
Leper and Occultist for life.
Personally this makes the game for me.
This is far from being the kind of RNG where you just hit the same button repeatedly until it works. Strategy is very important and very satisfying. The game is long and repetitive, however, and this controlled chaos means that fighting the same enemies with the same party for the fiftieth time could result in any number of wild cards demanding improvisation.

On that note, the other divisive part of the game is grindiness.
I actually don't regard it as very grindy, though it's probably a mentality thing.
I hate grind. I have finished a whopping one JRPG in my life because of it.
The difference here is that the combat is the whole point of Darkest Dungeon, whatever progress that comes with it being a secondary motivator. Most of the time I hardly care if I get the items I need for the thing or whatever, and just want to do another run to see how this new formation holds up in different situations.
It is far from succinct, though. A full playthrough on the standard difficulty can easily take over 100 weeks(1 quest = 1 week) if you take your time with learning and building up resources.

Sound is also worth a mention.
The music and narrator can get slightly old over time, being a little dramatic for situations that grow increasingly familiar, but that time sure doesn't come fast.
The music is distinctive and heightens the anxiety when the going gets rough, my favorite part being that it changes, growing louder and with new sounds mixed in as your torch starts to go out.
The narrator, voiced by Wayne June, is unforgettable. He's done a lot of good work on audiobooks, including Lovecraft stories, and he brought all that good juice in for his deliveries of the strange and dire lines about mortality and cosmic horrors.

Dumb footnote, but it probably improved my opinion a bit that it's a game from this decade that I can run on my trash laptop.
It's very light on requirements.

tl;dr(wouldn't blame you, pardon the rambles)
Very recommended, but consider what you're personally willing to put up with."

If I had to list my favorite things that make this game stand out it would have to be the incredible art style and aesthetic of the game, the high risk/high reward gameplay, and the amazing relationship the dev team has with the modding community.

Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"Darkest Dungeon is, at its core, a pain generator.  You win in this game by losing as slowly as possible.  If permanently losing a character you've spent hours leveling up because of a random crit would really upset you, this is not the game for you.  However, if you're not afraid of failure and are willing to push past the initial (and painful) learning curve, Darkest Dungeon has plenty of wonderful art and incredible encounters prepared for you.

Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"Good,no doubt!"
Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"Game has a lot of issues. However, I will still recommend it, because it does well what it does. It has story, it has atmosphere, it has satisfying combat system which was new when it came out.

First one is that there is no way to know how many supplies you gonna need. Nor there is any randomization of supplies. This results in simple lack of quality of life features. You have to memorise how much supplies and what kind you would need for any mission and there is no depth or gameplay there. Just fake depth. It does not help that supply system is kinda busted too. You will be clicking on torches in order to maintain above 76 light level for bonuses only to fail at the last second and get smaller bonuses at the start of combat or get stress penalties. Food system is also bugged. Sometimes it seems that it doesn't want to trigger, sometimes it is being triggered constantly. Bug seems to occur when you are backtracking.

Then there is just general lack of information what enemy abilities do. You do not know enemies capabilities nor you know your own. A good example are your own buffs/debuffs and how long they will last. 
In addition, RNG generator is also busted, those 80% hits seem to fail awfully often. More so when ability strikes all the members of a party. It has a tendency to fail on all of them which is statistically virtually impossible. 

Game is also very grindey. It spreads itself too thin and every line, every trinket, every ability and every mob will become tiresome. You have to kill every boss 3 times which is very annoying. You also do not seem to get that satisfaction of improvement. Your heroes tend to scale extremely with levels, mainly from blacksmith. However, at the same time game becomes rather ridiculous with boss capable of doing immense damage, of random battles being walk at the park in a same time. It also has extremely grindey and unpredictable heroes quests like of a shield breaker. I essentially need to do 7 quests for a specific class which appear sometimes and I have to have that class in my roster. Those quests also can fuck up my run. Game seem to struggle at the later stages as it fails to provide relevant scaling outside of simply throwing more stuff at the wall and locking content behind massive grinds.

Combat system is also very RNG dependent. I'm not talking about its swingy nature, but how much importance RNG has in its game. For example, there is no way to counter traps realistically. You can have reasonable 35% chance to scout. That is it. Otherwise you are walking into a trap and there is nothing you can do about it. Some heroes have skills to increase scout chance, but it requires to have them in the party and then to have time to camp in order to purchase that buff. Or how enemies can just roll through critical strikes when your guys just keep on missing. At a veteran, my party was beaten bloody by 4 ordinary spiders simply due to RNG. Whole party went from full hp to barely alive just because how dependent this game is on RNG.

Then there is an issue of speed. Turn priority is unclear and units will often violate their turn order despite having lower/greater speed. System is very imprecise and unclear. Just be happy that you are allowed to make a turn at all.


Another bug is that resolve tests sometimes misfire with stress values way below 100.

This game also does not show how any objects interact. In your journeys you will encounter many objects. Some will have an icon that they can used, some won't. There is no way of knowing what to do outside of annoying memorisation or wiki. This game obfuscates gameplay information for no good reason.

Game has other bugs. For example, you can pray even if your hero has a negative trait which prohibits praying. Then another bug is with Riposte which sometimes does not activate on some abilities when it should. 

There are some annoyances like getting mission completed screen before being able to loot last room. Or like trinket interface is annoying to use.

Surprise mechanic is broken. Your heroes can't get surprised in Radiant or Dim light according to wikipedia, but they get surprised regardless. Furthermore, game shuffles your units when surprised, but it doesn't do the same to enemy formations. This is quite common bug and one giant oversight in this game."
Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,GOD DAMN MOTHER FUCKER FUCK THIS GAME I LOVE IT
Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"I hate turn based games for the most part (I don't think chess or board games count, I meant videogames), and while this is a turn based game, it's still 10/10 somehow. Incredibly thought provoking, emotionally evocative, scary, funny, deep, but accessible. The music is on point, the voice guy (Wayne June) is so good he became immortalised in meme form, the art is clean with a clear vision, and the themes are internally consistent.

The only complaint is the same buggery complaint you'll hear any serious gamer make about a game they love but played too much, which is they 'wish it were better' while somehow forgetting it's given them hundreds of hours of incredible fun, and nothing else out there comes close."

[h1]USE launch option 2 (TWO) if you're NOT IN CHINA![/h1]

[h2]Unpredictably satisfying but lacking polish and openness.[/h2]

[h2]Pros[/h2]
[list]
[*][b]1440p ultrawide[/b] for gameplay only
[*][b]Very scenic[/b] when exploring
[*][b]Fluid controller support[/b] and the button mapping makes sense.
[*][b]Music does not pause in loading screens[/b], flows between scenes real nice.
[*][b]Looks very beautiful[/b] in almost every scene, got that fantasy clean look
[*][b]Imo unpredictable story and very little western cliches[/b]
[*][b]FISHING[/b]
[*][b]Diverse Mini-game[/b] substitutes out of combat loop
[*][b]Nice story cutscene placements[/b] between missions
[*][b]Comparatively makes more sense with little context[/b] as compared to (Sword of Legend Online), I didn't play Gujian 1 or 2 to be able to understand this game.

[h2]Cons[/h2]
[list]
[*][b]1080p Cutscenes[/b] can be uglier than in game renders at times
[*][b]English subtitles are confusing[/b] and makes little sense in conventional conversations due to blundering of poetic and philosophical sentences into casual but not accurate common english phrasings.
[*][b]Terrible repeating soundbites[/b], 2 second loop maximum for walking on hard marble and water noises is a 1 second loop. Combat is okay with sound.
[*][b]No subtitles in loading screen[/b] when loading, while playing dialogue, it does not show subtitles. (rarely happens)
[*][b]Invisible walls and no double jump[/b], it circumcised its own vertical exploration by giving you a big open land but invisible walls.
[*][b]The skyhaven city is big and empty.[/b] It's the big city you're suppose to be impressed by, vast and empty, depopulated but stretched big.
[*][b]Linear-open, instead of sandbox-open[/b], feels like I'm playing a PS2 game
[*][b]Almost no facial animation[/b], seriously sometimes I don't even think the lips are moving.
[*][b]Always-Online DRM[/b] the game is saved in the cloud. Impossible to play if your internet is lacking. This is a single player game.
[*][b]6 hours later, I noticed I saved into launch option 1[China][/b] vs launch option 2[North America]. Due to their funny funny DRM, this was written all in chinese so yeah... that's why loading takes so long.
[/list]

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
This is the highest rank in the [b]B-tier[/b] games I can think of, if comparing to the Witcher 3 (imo A++), I think Gujian 3 would be every aspect an step down into B++, as the witcher 3 has a familiar gameplay loop, bigger budget, prettier game, better sound etc. And this game is just one step down from lacking that perfection and polish, but has the freedom to be more creative in narrative story telling.

The only thing this game S-ranks in, is the cutscene story and gameplay loops. There is absolutely crazy shit happening after a nice calm period, and the game likes to throw you off with its mini games that isn't just standardised third person action combat.

[h2]Comparing to Sword of Legend Online[/h2]
[h3]Ironically if this game became out as a full MMORPG with its current features, pros and cons, it would be far worse than SOLO right now. Which is weird... but one thing I for sure do not miss, is the lack of context in SOLO where the MMORPG pretends you know Gujian's universe, and this game onboards players into the universe so much better."
古剑奇谭三(Gujian3),RPG,994280,Hope there is Gujian 4
古剑奇谭三(Gujian3),RPG,994280,"This game has beautiful scenery and art direction. I spent a good chunk of the game just snapping screenshots of everything. The story is very engaging and left me a little teary eyed at the end.
My only complaints are that it is hard to find rough wood to craft with even when you know all the spawning locations because it won't spawn everytime you go, so I never got past building a fishing net for sidequest crafting. Fortunately I didn't to craft much after it. My other complaint is that combat can feel a bit shallow and repetitive. There is feeling of lack of weight to your attacks that becomes more apparent as the game progresses because enemies become immune to your stun and knockdown attacks.

Other then that Gujian 3 was a fun experience and I rate it a 7.5/10. I bought the game on sale for $10 which almost feels like I robbed the developers."

The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,This game definitely needs a remake
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,its literally kino
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,"The game requires a lot of modding to play without losing sanity, but it can be a good time. Many characters and cards from Gwent come from this game, so if your a lore buff it may be required playing. Also if your gonna play max out the Igni spell. With proper investment it makes the game a joke. Unless you absolutely NEED to see how Witcher began, I'd probably just check out a recap video on YouTube. 

BE WARNED: Save often. The game can get into these weird fits where it will decide to crash all the time. I think it has something to do with the optimization."
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,"This game has not aged well at all, but the story is, without a doubt, amazing and fully enjoyable and is the real winner all this time later. Graphics-wise it's certainly not the worse but not great either, the real downfall is solely on the outdated mechanics which most people especially newcomers to the series are simply going to hate. But after all, it is almost 14 years old so it's understandable at the same time."
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,"Damn it, 55 hours and I couldn't complete the game. I got lost at chapter 5 out of 6.
Now I forgot everything out of it.

Still, I really need to replay this game and get invested in The Witcher Series.

Get a Graphic Overhaul mode, and play the game that started a saga, and shaped The Witcher Series as one of the best games of the 2000 years."
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,"Great start to The Witcher saga. You start to play game and disconnect from real life. After 5-10 hours you are in the Witcher's world. 

Witcher's world and story not like the others. Not a fairytale or heroic adventures. This world is full of wars between kingdoms, betrayals, lies and more...

Story is great. As you progress through the story you wonder what will happen next. Really, your choices can change the story. Characters are good too. Geralt is one of my favorite game characters.

But the most important thing sucks. Combat System. I played nearly 35 hours and still can't understand how does it work. A remake could be great for who wants to play in 2021.

The combat is outdated but it's actually pretty good once you get used to it. Witcher 1 has a great story, great ost, great atmosphere, and the graphics aren't that bad either considering it's from 2007, and it can run on almost any computer. I was an infant when this game came out, so I'm not speaking from nostalgia about how good this game is. I highly recommend playing through The Witcher series in order.

The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,"On one hand this is one of the ugliest games I have ever played, the gameplay is horrendously dated, no fast travel system, invisible walls every two feet, tons of bugs, and utter jank around every corner. On the other hand its a witcher game and the universe it contains holds it up. Nowadays on sale I would recommend if your a hardcore Witcher fan. The story is great and just being able to explore the Witcher universe. Overall its like a 3 or 4 without the witcher license but it just has the so bad its great feel. So im gonna rate it a 5/10"
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,I would say it's quite a good game to play if you like to see how Witcher began.

The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,"Played this game again almost after 13 years and it still is amazing. I will agree that the game hasn't aged that well, so I doubt that a new player will enjoy it that much as an old returning player. After first couple of hours of gameplay I completely forgot how clunky the gameplay is mechanic-wise. The story of this game is still a strong point, in fact it really grabs you and makes you want to play more. 

So if you are fan of Witcher then do give this a try because after all this game was from where it all started."
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,"TLDR: For 10 bucks you can't go wrong. This was a great time. If you're a fan of adult, fantasy cRPGs you will enjoy this one.

Wow, this is yet another one of these games that I really wish I played years ago.

This game is fantastic, it's extremely open, has just enough hand holding for you to allow yourself discover stuff on your own. The writing is great, with many of the characters you meet being very interesting. Environmentally this game is on par with some of the best games of the time (e.g. Dragon Age) and surpasses it in many ways.

Combat feels dated, but comparing it to other RPGs of the time it was interesting, and it seems to fit with the times. Potion brewing, scavenging for ingredients, all sorts of stuff I enjoy.

Technically this version of the game does suffer from some issues on newer versions of Windows, with alt-tabbing being a problem. DXVK fixes most of these issues provided you avoid installing high resolution texture mods. EAX support is easily fixed with DSOAL, and provided you pick the right HRTF settings can sound pretty great.

TLDR: For 10 bucks you can't go wrong. This was a great time. If you're a fan of adult, fantasy cRPGs you will enjoy this one."

Trials of Mana,RPG,924980,"Right off the bat. I'm 34 while I write this. I grew up with SNES and Genesis, 90's computer games, Playstation 1. Nintendo 64. I have a very strong preference for pre-rendered backgrounds of the PS1 JRPG era, and the spritework of the SNES era. I played Seiken Densetsu 3 on an emulator a long time ago, probably two decades ago now. My general consensus on the original is that it's a soulful game with fantastic pixel art and sound. 

Now this is Square Enix in 2020's. I'm not a fan of Square Enix these days. I thought FFXV was bad. I thought Dragon Quest XI was pretty bad. Did I think that Trials of Mana was bad? No. I enjoyed it, but throughout the entire playthrough (I'm now on my second) I could not help but look around at the world and find it to be an example of doing the bare minimum. I found it to be soulless. Square Enix has a lot of money, but they're a business and let's face it, not a lot of Gen Z know about Secret of Mana. It's a millenial or older series. They were taking a risk with this game. They knew it wouldn't be banging out Final Fantasy numbers. Final Fantasy brings Final Fantasy numbers, and I feel they're lazy and uncoordinated regarding that as well. They did a good job with the UI, the voice acting, and the orchestrated vs. original soundtrack options were great. I feel like the combat was done well, but the world. The world around you is so cookie cutter. All of the environments just feel lacking in soul. I hate pulling the soul card, but that's the only way I can put it. The rock faces and backgrounds are lazily thrown together. The assets all just kind of blend together. The world map is atrocious. When going to the mana tree or just any iconic location there is no sense of scale or awe about much of any of it. It's all just bubbly, colorful, smoothed-out stuff that gets the job done. I wouldn't expect more from Square Enix. Especially not now. I think the company is coasting and resting on their laurels. People will buy their products. They didn't have to go the extra mile and try a different visual style with this that would suit the series better. I don't have a better way to express ""I have visions for how this world could be, that are fully within their grasp, but they chose to just make it look like Dragon Quest XI"". DQXI art style I feel fits DQ much more than the Mana series. 

I bought this Half-Off. I didn't hate what I enjoyed, obviously, but everything Square does lately just leaves me with a ""What if they still had the passion they used to?"". Never with the old Squaresoft did I feel they were cutting corners or just putting things out there. Maybe some people absolutely love this art style and think I'm crazy. 

You young? Never played this game in the past on SNES? Wanna know if you should buy it? Play the Demo. That will give you a good idea. Secret of Mana is carried by it's whimsical and entrancing world and soundtrack, and the story is just a very simple ""save the world!"" kinda thing. it's not too deep. I feel like this remake falls way short of delivering what I look for in the world, but the magic isn't completely missing here, just nowhere near where I think it could be.

Get it on sale, or don't."
Trials of Mana,RPG,924980,"This game is unplayable initially as the difficulty is not even slightly challenging and you can't play the harder difficulties without finishing the game first; a critical flaw that they think players want, nobody wants to drool on their first play-through.

Do you want that old school experience where you need to grind, choose skill points correctly and attack/dodge with general strategy?

I have found on Vortex Mods a couple of things to fix this game:
Rebalance mod: makes the game actually challenging and fixes exp
No attack indicators: Want to actually use your brain? Use this mod
No Blue Crystal Sound: This turns off that awful spam sound for combo gauge crystals

With these mods, the game is actually phenomenal. You need to think and apply actual strategy in how you approach levelling and classes as well as skills."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,"This, along with the sequel is two of my top 10 games of all time.  Relatively unpopular opinion but I like this a little more than the sequel. These two games singlehandedly made me fall in love with turn based combat.

I adore the over-the-top humor, cartoonish atmosphere and graphics, extraordinary world building and detail. I wish I could erase my memory and replay this masterpiece all over again."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,"[b][i]Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition[/i][/b] is a party-RPG.
The character development system is classless, there are several skill trees and weapon types. The combat is turn-based.
Graphics and sound are adequate, the controls are rebindable, but can be unresponsive. 

The game is very co-op friendly.

There were few small bugs and lore-related inconsistencies with other games in the series."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,"as a rpg it is legit, even amazing... but its story is just... meh. just say it is not my type. characters are having adventures, that's cool. and adventures are pretty good. but they do not grow as the story proceed. they learn more about their past yea, but lack of depth. and i do not think there are curves.  as a game i admit it is pretty fun, even tho some puzzles are really hard. i just do not like its story, it is too typical. i would give it neuter if that is an option.
also there are not much hints about how you should do your mission, this can be a good thing, or bad, depends on how you see it. but you just need abit more patience to find out what's the next you should do. but it requires you to think more and be creative, and pay attention to everything you can read. i consider this a good feature. but also you can get frustrated coz you might mess up (for example kill some npc without realizing he or she is important in some quest) and that will cause some quests can not be finished as you expected."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,"Such a great game, great writing, and a deep world to explore. Fully voiced (EVERY character, even the talking rats and deer). I played Divinity Original Sin 2 first, while this one is missing some mechanics of that game, it's so good. If you like XCOM 1 and 2, and like fantasy games, this one is worth it. It holds up well to the test of time."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,An absolute blast to play coop. Larian churning out gold.
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,"Nearly everything in this game is very good: The graphics, the character system, the fighting system, the choices. If you only need this, than this is propably a fun game for you.

However, it fails in the most important discipline of a roleplaying game: The story. The last third of the story arc is one of the worst I've ever had experienced in a roleplaying game. 

You were dissapointed with the original ending of Mass Effect 3 or the last episode of Lost? Don't play this game; the ending is so disappointing and you really have the feeling that the story was written in a rush towards the end. It is promising at first, however, in the end, you don't have the feeling that any of your choices mattered and it was going so completely crazy that every author should have this as an case book on how not to end a promising story."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,"I finished the game on my second attempt (hence the 160 hours - about 65 hours first attempt). I wanted to finish the game because it looked very nice, combat was good and there were some aspects that were fun. I failed for the first time because of the non-immersive story.

When I finally finished the game, I was disappointed. Nearing the end, it was very frustrating (I would stop playing it but I just wanted to finish it when I had invested 80 hours in it already and it was the second time). And the main story which had appeared very nice was very disappointing.

Cons:
- Very slow pace, non-immersive.
- Some bad and frustrating... let's call it puzzles. Lit a candle to open something (just a regular candle like many other candles everywhere)? Take a book and carry it for a long time to progress somewhere else when there are million of useless books lying everywhere? Find a switch in a big cavern to move some rocks? Really?
- It is nice that every dialog is narrated... but the NPCs around repeat it very often and forever! Try to manage your inventory when you hear the same sentence again, and again, and again... it's mad.
- Disappointing main story.

Pros:
- Very nice graphics.
- Combat is good (with a few exceptions).
- Narration (except the repetition).
- Some very nice mechanics like traits from decisions, pet pal, surfaces."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,Love it! Hooked for hours! Guaranteed!
Euro Truck Simulator 2,Simulation,227300,"To be honest i really thought i would find this boring. well it doesn't happen often but i am really happy to say, i was wrong. I love driving around, doing jobs, customising my trucks... yes trucks meaning more than one lol. a great selection of music to drive along with.  My favourite part? seeing and hearing the other players on the multi player servers and yes i will talk back lol.
I can't recommend this enough, give it a go. it's not a game i would have even looked at if it wasn't for a special person in my life and i know this is gonna be a game in my life always.

It's fun, relaxing and exciting at times

Details-
Trucks: are amazing, they have every detail involved i absolutely love it!
Artificial Intelligence (AI): They could do with a spruce up, but the fact that this game is over 10 years old you guys are doing fine!
Buildings: For an open world game of this size the graphics and detailing done on the buildings are perfectly fine, good job!
Views: One word, spectacular!!! <3

Every stud of detailing is perfect for a game this size, Good work SCS! I'm looking forward to any new games to come in the future!"
Euro Truck Simulator 2,Simulation,227300,This has to be one of the most realistic open-world simulator game to date. Glad to be able to experience the game and share out the thoughts. Lets drive truck people.

Euro Truck Simulator 2,Simulation,227300,"Been playing this game for years, like it a lot. If you like to drive trucks, this is your game, don't miss it."
Euro Truck Simulator 2,Simulation,227300,"This game is awesome for going around Europe and delivering cargo. 
The time you spend on the road is pretty relaxing and when you make a stop at a gas station and look around its pretty nice view from all the driving and you can even sleep at some stops.

The game even gives you the abilities to get your own truck and customize it to your taste, hell they even let you get your own trailer if you want it! 
The more you drive around the world and getting your own garage in each city, you feel pretty successful that you made it this far.

The scenery from other countries are beautiful and it makes you think ""Man i need to go there sometimes"" or it just stunts you from the amazing view out there.

If the highway is too much for you, you can just go to smaller roads and mountains roads to get away from the simple straight road and maneuver your way to your destination


all and all. Good game to enjoy from life."
Euro Truck Simulator 2,Simulation,227300,"As an ATS player i was expecting ETS2 to be the same game with different trucks and that be all. I was wrong. ETS2 is very different from ATS and shows different landscapes, trees and highways that are all unique to the game. It fells more compact in lots of places and it is fun to see how much the road layouts change as you move from country to country. Like ATS ETS2 also has lots of mods to change your game however you want. Over all a very fun game. Good job SCS"
Euro Truck Simulator 2,Simulation,227300,"i dont know how to drive but in amogus the imposter has to sabotage the crew and the ship and they have to find out if your sus and if you are they can vote you off in this you can blame other people for being imposter and this is cool in a way
so anyway wanna play Among Us?
add me so we can play :)"

Euro Truck Simulator 2,Simulation,227300,So far I like this game a lot.
Euro Truck Simulator 2,Simulation,227300,10000000%
Euro Truck Simulator 2,Simulation,227300,"The game is as described: a great simulator of being a transport driver. I would like for the original version to have a larger European map that it covers without buying add-ons, but otherwise its well featured. I give it a buy."
Euro Truck Simulator 2,Simulation,227300,"Brilliant game, I have spent 108 hours on this game and have loved every minute, I highly recommend this game."
Euro Truck Simulator 2,Simulation,227300,I like the different trucks and how relaxing is the game. The sound of the trucks though is awfully terrible.
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"well i've both game in my library ETS and ATS though i like ATS more because it's just feels different , i just can't explain it well but surely this game magical elixir for people who are facing Anxiety/Depression during Pandemic it's really works like a drug and instant anxiety reliever. simulation features are perfect and gives you real life driving simulator experience ... no doubt why reviews are Overwhelmingly Positive.. it's awesome game to try with steering wheel... i am really enjoying it and looking forward to buying all remaining dlc if they decide to low down prices little bit in sale time.. overall must game for people who want to experience real truck driving.. buy without hesitation and support the developers."
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"American Truck Simulator is another production from the great SCS Software studio. Considering how they care for their players in Euro Truck Simulator 2, it couldn't be otherwise! The creators once again prove that the games they create are complete products and the support does not end when the game / add-on is paid for, but all the time! Soon there should be an update of the state of California, the original state that appeared with the game's premiere over 5 years ago and is still being improved and adapted to current standards both visually and technically.

I must admit that I do not know any game development studio that has an approach similar to SCS Software's policy. Here, the player and his final satisfaction are clearly in the first place and this is the most important thing for them. Repeatedly updated, added and extended at no cost, even several years old add-ons are something we do not encounter every day!

The basic version of the game was originally supposed to include California from the premiere and, after a short time, Nevada. Due to the delays, the studio decided to provide players with another addition - Arizona completely free of charge, hence we finally have 3 quite different states to visit! In addition, at very attractive prices, we have the opportunity to expand our game world with new additions that appear regularly. Each of them is prepared with increasing care so that the quality that is offered from the very first moments with the game is even higher! Something amazing!

Plus, what would a truck game be without these massive vehicles? :) In the game, we have a wide range of trucks from leading manufacturers to choose from. Originally, Kenworth, Peterbilt and Volvo trucks were available in the game, but with time and subsequent updates (of course free updates), new brands Mack, Western Star and Freightliner were added so that you could move around the game world with virtually all types of trucks that actually move around the United States.

Of course, we have the option to personalize our truck by selecting technical aspects such as the engine, suspension or gearbox, but also its visual aspects, both external and internal. Thanks to this, we can literally feel at home in the middle of our truck!

Another important aspect is the ability to run your own company, which as we develop, we can expand with new employees, buying them trucks to work and thus earn for us. A very interesting economic and logical mode that is a lot of fun!

In addition to expanding the world itself through numerous updates, the numerous companies already present in the game are also expanded (new ones are added), extended with new goods that we can transport.

In addition, the game regularly features seasonal events that consist in fulfilling specific goals by players from around the world (e.g. transporting 300,000 deliveries of vaccines within a certain period of time), which is a great variety and thanks to which we have the opportunity to receive nice prizes!

Many people are surely wondering if this is something completely new or just a copy of Euro Truck Simulator 2 transferred to American roads. Personally, it feels completely different driving ""short"" European trucks with tight turns and roads in Europe, and completely different in the United States, driving American beasts whose turn profile varies significantly. In my opinion, both productions complement each other perfectly and it is worth reaching for both! :)

Summing up, is it worth it? Yes of course! The game will provide us with many hours of fun and I assure you that we will not be bored, because personally I can't wait to go on tour and visit places that I have not had the opportunity to see yet! I highly recommend it and see you on the route! :)"
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,i drive exclusively on the shoulder at full speed to avoid speeding tickets
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"Although the sensation of driving a bit similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2, this game has a thick American landscape and atmosphere, which is very suitable for those who are seeking for a realistic simulation games."
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"ITS A FUN ENJOYABLE GAME ,BUT ONE THING THIS GAME NEEDS IS WRECKER TRUCKS AND SOME OLD CLASSIC TRUCKS BUT ALL IN ALL A FANTASTIC GAME"
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"Great simulation experience. Get into your truck and take your load. Open your favourite playlist. And enjoy the peaceful journey on the roads of USA.

If you want, you can travel through America with your friends. Imo this is the best part of the game. And ATS MP community isn't toxic like ETS2 MP.

But game isn't great. Most of the map is desert and looks same. The map is too small in the standard version (without DLC's) of the game. And you need to pay money to more.

3/5"
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,A fun and relaxing game to play. Great scenery and and few challenges thrown in. Recommend playing it.
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,Love Playing really nice just to cill :)
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,Really good game. With each DLC better and better.
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"[h1] From a Trucker & Transporter in Real World [/h1]

I would say this is the only game where you can believe you are driving a real truck, with all the controls.
I would suggest you everyone to have all the map dlcs to enjoy this game fully with friends and family.

And I would like to suggest you all to have ""TruckersMP"" mod to play this game in Multiplayer with peoples around the globe.
There are so many VTCs (virtual trucking companies) competing each other on third party websites. Most common is ""Trucksbook"".

So lets see you on the American Roads in game."

American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"I can't drive in real life despite being 21, but I think I'd make a really good trucker. I hope they add Iowa soon, that's my favorite state. I especially love the city of Davenport Iowa. I hope that if the developers add the state of Iowa they also include the city of Davenport. I am not from Iowa by the way, in fact I've never been there, so I am not biased when I say that Iowa is the best state and my favorite and that Davenport is also a great city which I hope is added to the game in the near future. Davenport has really amazing princess parties, I hope those are also included in the Davenport Iowa dlc. Please SCS, include the princess parties in Davenport Iowa when you are creating the Davenport Iowa dlc."
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"One of the best sims I've ever played. However it wold be extra amazing if we add other environments & layouts in the game. for eg snowy environments, and diff road lay outs like a lil off the road kinda thing than rather just sticking to the tarmac"

American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"great game, very detailed"
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"[h1] By far one of the best simulation games currently on the market, [/h1]

In 2002, a small, barely known software company known as SCS Software released it's first trucking simulation game, 18 Wheels of Steel: Hard Truck. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318750/ Fast forward to 2016, and SCS has returned to its roots with American Truck Simulator. Like Euro Truck Simulator 2, Euro Truck Simulator and the multitude of 18 Wheels of Steel titles before it, American Truck Simulator continues a tradition of realistic simulation games from the now famed Czech developer/publisher. Get behind the wheel of the most popular brands of trucks, with an ever-expanding list of makes and models made available free with frequent updates combined with a constantly expanding list of states to drive through, from California to Washington to Colorado, with Wyoming and Texas on their way in the near future, it's clear that SCS has their heart and soul in both ATS and ETS 2, being what I could consider two of the most frequently updated games since their initial release dates. 

Speaking of updates, the frequency at which that SCS updates this game and it's sister title, Euro Truck Simulator 2, shows the dedication they carry and the devotion they have to their player base. Some may say it really is the #BestCommunityEver, with player counts having reached an all time high since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, and even that couldn't slow down the team as they powered through 2020 with the same positivity and dedication as they had in previous years. Combine the periodic updates improving a game built on what could be considered an [u] ancient [/u] game engine by today's standards, SCS continues to beat AAA studios at their own game in a niche market flooded with cheap imitations. This is highlighted by the recent 1.40 update, which introduced a brand new lighting system, drastically improving the realism of the game world by an unprecedented amount, and not long before that, the 1.37 update introduced the open-source FMOD sound engine, allowing for more realistic sounds to be implemented into the game.

Going back on the #BestCommunityEver, SCS continues to impress by being one of the most supportive studios when it comes to mods. That's right, a little game studio with less than 500 people based out of Prague makes games and actively supports it's modding community more than most AAA studios could even dream of, and in my opinion they even beat out Bethesda Softworks in terms of the modding tools they offer to the community, from official modelling plugins for Blender to the official Steam Workshop upload tool. They've even gone as far as to hire a number of members of the modding community, including legends like SiSL and 50keda, famous for SiSL's Mega Pack and the extensive DAF XF reworks respectively. They'll even go as far as to leave extreme detail in their patch notes for each update to inform modders of the changes they've made to the game that will affect mods as they are developed. 

If you're looking to play with friends, I would suggest the TruckersMP mod, available for both ATS and ETS 2. It receives frequent updates, and is often updated days if not weeks after each update dropped by SCS. However, if you already play TruckersMP but want something a bit more stable that will work on release day for every future update, then I highly encourage you to check out Convoys, a feature coming in update 1.41. Having previewed Convoys in the experimental branch prior to Open Beta, this is an officially supported multiplayer system, some might even liken it to co-op, complete with AI synchronization, something that TruckersMP currently lacks. Currently, Convoys only supports 8 players, a far cry from the several thousand player support across multiple servers with TruckersMP, but that doesn't mean you should count out Convoys at all. SCS promises to improve the system even further, and who knows how far they'll go with this new mode. Mod support on Convoys is currently unavailable for stability reasons, but that doesn't mean that SCS [u] will never [/u] support mods for it in future updates. It's a great alternative if you want something that's a bit more down-scaled and a bit more interactive, with roadside scenarios and detours being synchronized for each player. 

In conclusion, if you want a game that lets you work at your own pace and enjoy exploration, then there really isn't a reason for you to not pick up this game. With the starting point price $19.99  it's not going to break the bank like a AAA title might at $59.99, and the consistent updates and map expansions make American Truck Simulator a game worth investing in."

 That's all I really have to say.  The developers do a great job with updates and DLC, which is reasonably priced.  I'm keen to buy more states as they are developed.  I enjoy it a lot, and recommend it to anyone that wants an easier, but rewarding experience."

American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"Calming drives, beautiful views, superb realism, great game overall, especially if you're using a wheel."
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"It's a good game, just make sure you won't turn it into a business tycoon. If you do so you don't have to do jobs for anything you want to buy (trucks and garages) and it will become kinda boring.
only thing i have to say is that maybe they could've made the cities a bit bigger so you don't drive at the same place all the time."
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,Trucks.
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,Nice game.
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"Driving down the open road. Phil Collins playing on the radio. The sun setting in the distance. 500 more miles to go until you reach your destination. The hum of the diesel engine. All your troubles fade away.

ATS is a good game. It's not necessarily a great game but for me the radio stations and the atmosphere make it great. It's fun to play when you want to drink a beer and drive across country without risking a DUI. Sure its a bit repetitive at times but the truck customization and constant release of new DLC make it fun. I find myself going back to the game even after playing it for years.

My only gripe is that they have not released the states faster. It is American truck simulator not west coast truck simulator. At this rate we may have all 50 states by the year 2040. Even though the base game is cheap as you add more states (some are free) and DLC the cost will add up fast.

 If you want to cruise across the open road while listening to some great tunes on the radio, grinding your way to up the ladder to become the ultimate trucking empire this game is for you. It's a true simulator (at least the best yet) for trucking.

Also shout out to the content creators and modders for adding soo much wonderful content for this game. 
Picking this game up for $5 on sale is well worth the money just be prepared to spend a lot more on DLC or use the steam workshop to upgrade the game for free non-officially.

American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,BEWARE: This game has become a second job for me. I simply cannot put it down. It is very relaxing especially paired with a podcast on in the background. I have not played any DLC but would definitely recommend the base game at least. 9.2/10
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,hella fun when your not shifting through 8 gears and back down because of a stoplight
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"After playing ETS2 for many years, I decided to try out the preview version of this game. It very soon took my heart, and when it got on discount, I immediately bought it along with two map DLCs. Now I am playing it as often as I do play Euro Truck Simulator 2. You did amazing work SCS, thank you very much!"
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,If you like driving and jamming out to music then highly recommend. But if you wanna play it in vr then it is amazing.

American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"I've never driven a truck, let alone a damn semi truck. Yet somehow I have fallen in love with this game. I never thought I was the type of person to enjoy a simulator game and I only really purchased this game because it was $5, but I would gladly have paid $60 for it... which is why I ended up buying all of the DLC around 10 hours into playing. This game just makes me enjoy gaming in a way that I haven't felt in a long time.

I would easily score this game [b]10/10[/b]

Cities: Skylines does an amazing job of what its trying to achieve. A [b]proper city building[/b] game. In essence, even the business model behind this game achieves this. A game with rapid DLC production means a game with CONSTANT content and support, subsequently creating a huge modding community. These modifications change the game in incredibly meaningful ways. From intricate traffic management (TM:PE), to ULT and lighting adaptations. This allows the player to transport themselves into the most realistic, beautiful looking places you could imagine. From just a small, pitstop gas station in the desert to large transport networks and interchanges, you can make anything you might see in real life traveling in your car.

I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in painting a scene you might see in real life. Or just so you can nuke a bunch of imaginary cims with meteors, a games a game isnt it?

Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,It is a prime city builder. Best of any I've tried.
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,its worth the money!
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"[h1] Cities Skylines is simply the best city building game out there! [/h1]
As a fan of all the SimCity games, I hated seeing the downfall of SimCity in 2013 but I was so grateful when this came out. No other game of this kind can compete with it.

[b] Pros: [/b] 
[b] 1. [/b] It is extremely detailed! Basically every logical thing was thought of and added by the developers. 
[b] 2. [/b] The graphics are pretty good. It's not very important for this kind of game; but still, it looks nice.
[b] 3. [/b] Map size is huge! You can spend over a hundred hours easily to build a single city. With mods, it's even bigger!
[b] 4. [/b] It comes included with a map, asset, theme, and scenario editor allowing you to easily create your own custom content. 
[b] 5. [/b] Modding support is simply the best! There are 10's of thousands of mods to pick from, allowing you to completely customize your city however you want, as well as adding new ways to play. 
6. The developers are continuing to support the game even after 6 years.

[b] Cons: [/b]
[b] 1. [/b] The game does require a beefy system to maintain playability. The larger your city becomes, the worse it gets. For myself, Playing with an RTX 3080, Ryzen 7 5800x and 32Gb of RAM, I get around 30fps in my city with 100k population. Optimization could definitely be better.
[b] 2. [/b]  There is a small amount of tutorials in game. Given it's great detail, it can take awhile for new players to learn how everything works. 
[b] 3. [/b] DLC's have gotten out of hand over the years. There are so many DLC's, that for new players it's hard to know which is even worth buying. Some of them are great and worth your consideration, others are just nearly useless and a waste of money. Not to mention, you can download mods that make some DLC worthless. It's 2021 so I suppose you can't expect much less then being flooded with more DLC to buy.

Overall, it's simply the best city building/city simulation game currently on the market. Given the nearly endless amount of mods, there is always ways to build your city better, bigger and more detailed. I highly recommend the game! Your money will be well spent."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,you idiodick people play this game now!!
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,Fun city building
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"I'll keep it short.. I used to not want to try this game because I thought Sim City franchise was better. I was a Sim City Puritan, even when they released their last Sim City (which was pleasing to look at, nice to play for most part but very limited in capacity tbh). It took me few years after released of this game to get into it, with all the DLCs, Content Creator packs (Which is a great initiative, kudos to Paradox for introducing and allowing this) and I am blown away with how wonderful this game is, and how difficult and challenging it can be too. I love the dynamics of the game with everything that we do down to the granule decisions and implication that comes with it. I have no complain tbh, I wish for more contents though. More is good!

I really was thinking if would be great if yall could come up with some political systems to this game.. that would be groundbreaking. Socialism, Capitalism, etc. and see how it affects city building and the people's reactions."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,I love this game! I would recommend this game to anybody who loves city building games. The only downside to this game is you need more Mods to create the city you truly want...
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"The game is great - it really tests creativity and offers a relaxing and enjoyable experience that is unmatched by any other game I have played. Mods take it to the next level - you can spend ages on single details like intersections. I highly recommend this game, especially with mods as the devs have done a great job at leaving it open to the community and there are some really cool things in the Workshop."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,ate but makes you feel so stupid at times
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,proper good game mush
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,Best city building game ever!
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"Addicting, to say the least."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"It's fine. I obviously enjoy it enough given the hours. It doesn't need any more positive reviews than it already has. Is it better than cities XL? Absolutely. Sim City? Absolutely. But that's more a comment on the state of city management games than the quality of this game. So on to the criticism, since it's all I ever do.

It's basically a traffic simulator, and does it extremely poorly. Road selections are terrible and citizens are extraordinarily simplistic. There is no lane control. There is only a 2 lane 1-way and a 6 lane 1-way (which I have never witnessed in existence once in my life and isn't even utilized by the games AI)... 

Mods GREATLY improve this, at the risk of added instability to an already poorly optimized game. Which seems to be this games development model, let the community fix it. I have bought a bunch of the expansions on sale recently and even the best ones feel half baked and low risk. I am scared for Paradox signing up for a second game with this company. While Paradox does put out some janky games, at least they progress greatly over time. This game hasn't moved an inch by the developers hand since release.

And again, what was release was extremely lacking:

Why there isn't a blueprint mode before you lay stuff down given the horrendous terraforming and janky snapping is beyond me. Money is only a problem in the very early game, making many financial choices arbitrary. Water is extraordinarily quirky and feels like a gimic. Building models between different sized buildings feel completely out of scale and certainly have very strange population capacities (again, can be fixed by a mod but mod user beware). The UI is very confusing, often unexplained and for some aspects of the game, like subways, a complete nightmare. God forbid you move a single stop in the entire game or be prepared to redo every single line hitting it.

I played through maybe 2 cities my first run with the game, then didn't touch it for another 6 years. Dropped 40 dollars on xpacs ON SALE (not nearly all of them, but the biggest ones) and barely got another run out of it."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"The only City Building/Construction Management Game I know that locks off loans and off-ramps from the player at the beginning of the game. Mods are REQUIRED to offset the amount of retarded oversighted fundamental elements like this that the developers haven't bothered to fix or update since launch.

Of course, as a game released in 2015, it's miles ahead of the older games that paved the way in the city building genre, but it can't compete with contemporary games like Transport Fever as Cities Skylines barely has its fucking basics together.

Skylines is only good if half the content in your game is from the steam workshop; effort/content from a community that expects no payment, unlike Paradox the developers of skylines, which pumps out small collections of assets for the cost of multiple hours of minimum wage labor. If you're looking for a proper and complete city builder, aim for Theotown or Transport Fever 2. The former if you want a SimCity sort of Jive, the latter if you want a better version of this.

If you decide to get this, be both prepared to comb the workshop for things that should be included in the base game for a decent while before playing, as well as be prepared to troubleshoot each mod of the many mods you'd downloaded when a major update or DLC is released (the major updates tend to render a few of the rarely updated mods in your collection into [i]absolute game fuckers.[/i])"
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"A very good city builder, I have spent way to much time playing this lol"
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"Started playing this just for kicks and now just obsessed with making my city grow.  The controls are a bit clunky (imho), but you get used to it.  There are plenty of workshop items to make things personalized.  You find yourself reinventing your city to accommodate newer and bigger items when they unlock.  Micromanagement types will like the constant tweaking to make the city grow.  Overall just something to make the brain work and have fun doing it."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,i liked it because it is cool
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"its fun, chill and build a community."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"Great game, but a fairly North American take on city planning."

Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"1.Uninstall the Paradox Launcher.
2.Create a bach file in your directory as ""cities.bat"".

5.Delete ""launcher-installer-windows.msi"" in the games directory.

Congratulations, you've deleted a useless launcher prety much designed as a spyware. Enjoy your game."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"The game in itself his good. How ever using the just the Vanilla game and a few addons published by paradox, no mod it take 12 minutes to load... It is extreamly unstable. I  do not have this issue with FS 2020, Hearts of Iron 4, Kerbal Space program, and other software more demanding in graphic and memory. I can only conclude on bad game coding. 
"
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,I really enjoy playing this. One of my wonders is exactelly looking at city skylines and this game offers this experience in the most realistic and godlike way. Playing this you also realize how difficult it is to run a city but you can overcome by learning new strategies along the city's history and with each new city. Love it!
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,ini baru buang buang waktu yg enak
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"This is one of those times where I really wish ""It depends"" is a response I can give for whether or not I recommend a game.

PROS:
-Art direction/animation is pretty good. It sits somewhere between trying too hard to look real and trying too hard to NOT look real. (this made more sense in my head before I typed it out)
-Steam Workshop support is so total that you can control factors you wouldn't even notice if you only experience the base game. In fact, this is one of the first times that I would recommend a game almost completely for its modding community.

CONS:
-Bearing in mind this can be fixed with mods, it's quite easy to be overstimulated or overwhelmed by the sheer amount of T H I N G S happening at the same time.
-Mods can cause extra problems, and that's true for pretty much any game that has an active modding community. There will be a lot of time spent fiddling with settings, exiting and restarting, and browsing the Steam Workshop compared to actually [playing] the game.

Overall, if you want a game that you can experiment with on a deep level, and if you like sandbox games, this will suffice just fine."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"After playing Cities:Skylines for nearly 9000 hours, I think it's safe to say that I finally have enough experience to make a review. 

Overall, it's a pretty decent game but can get boring after the first 8,500 hours if you don't download new workshop mods and assets."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"u make a city
its amazing"
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"Despite the huge playtime, I can't decide whether I actually like this game, whether I enjoy playing it, or whether it's good. It can be sort of comforting to play, but cities almost always end up being the same sort of US suburb, and most of the challenge is, every time, traffic management. Your cities have no history, no focus unless you impose one artificially (and even then it's more aesthetic than functional), no life (it's depressingly easy to bulldoze whole districts - the citizens who lived there relocate without a squeak), no charm. I think I keep playing it because I keep hoping it'll somehow become the game I want."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"'tis dope. With or without mods. Take your time and learn from others how to make efficient cities, but at the end of the day, make something that you like to look at. Just take moments to explore your city. 
Highly recommend. My fiancee and I are quite addicted."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"After playing this game for over 750h I can say, that this game is the best and most creative simulation game since The Sims 2. Even more so.  Where The Sims turned to the wrong direction, Colossal Order realized what makes a game truly great: - community! 
A game with such a wonderful and creative community and developers understanding how important community and their creativity is to the gaming experience, this game is more than a sum of its parts. It sucks you in to the world where everything is in your power, where only limits are your limits of imagination. If it doesn't exist yet, you or some other gamer are probably inventing it already! You are a true creator of your own cities."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"This game was advertised based on its dynamic traffic AI. A colony of ants is smarter than this game's AI. I've had multiple cities grind to a halt and completely implode, *entirely* because the game's AI refuses to use more than one lane of the three-lane road it's given. The game's AI is legitimately retarded, and it will destroy cities for no apparent reason. I will never recommend this game to anyone I know. SimCity 4 is a much better city sim in literally *every* aspect."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"The game is easy to pick up, but has a lot of complexity to keep enjoyment going."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,highly recommend this game its tons of fun specially with custom assets and mods just be warned you'll need a powerful system to load lots of assets as unity don't manage resources very well other then that its fairly fun and i highly recommend it
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck of awful city planning, boundless and bare
The lone and level pollution stretch far away.

although it's an annoying bore to fix every little mistake looking over your little city after it's finished is a joy unmatched to any I've had in a long time."

[spoiler]Sorry mr greek words. I might not have more games with $200 dollars worth of bullcite dlc. If I do, I'll make more. [/spoiler]"
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,The game made for the purposes of selling DLC.
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"It's a good game - but the flaws just make the experience unenjoyable to such an extent, at least for a vanilla (no mods) experience.
A lot of basic functions such as traffic and garbage begin to fail very quickly even in a reasonably well connected city with very little than can be done to fix the issue at times. Every now and then finnicky roads, railways, and other items, will not act how you would expect making building the city quite difficult.
Not to mention that on any lower to even middle end PC (I know this from experience) you can't even reach the end game of a city without suffering lag beyond belief due to the RAM requirements."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"So I bought this game it had a lot of positive feedback I know, I'm just gonna bullet point list all the positive things I feel about this game and bad things.
Bad
1: without the DLC's for this game unlocked there is nothing to do.
2: the DLC's are expensive for this game for what your getting out of them.
3: The Format of the standard game is very generic for being a game released after 2010.
4: the standard game content is also very limited.
5: sim city 4 was a better game too compare and is cheap, and old as dirt.
6: it just was not fun enough to make me want to buy DLC's.
7: the older cities titles have more content sadly and looks way better then this.
8: come taste the game for just 30$ and realize they are really trying to sell you DLC's more then sell you a game
pros about this game
1: there is a lot of DLC content if you can afford it to make this game content rich enough to be enjoyable.
2: I'm a huge fan of DLC content for sure."

I tried to watch a video that Cities Skylines made it didn't help, I because i have over 83 pages of mods, so it wouldn't help to unsubscribe and subscribe again,  even so i tried and it still didn't work, please if anyone has a way to fix this tell me. Please?....."

Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,I am a long-time fan of the city simulation games and was super happy I found this one.  Cities Skyline has many features I was familiar with but implemented so much better.  The graphics are the most impressive that I feel like I am part of the action and really get to know the character of my city.  I am just starting to learn some nuances that will make be a better city manager in time.  This game is a home run!

Kerbal Space Program,Simulation,220200,All of the perfect physics to be a space simulator (if you are a space geek this game is for you)
Kerbal Space Program,Simulation,220200,"Kerbal space program is just one of those games that you come back to time and time again. What's different about it is that each time you do come back you put another 100 hours in. With its realistic physics and and easy to use building UI this game is very accessable  to most people  and the learning curve is isnt too steep. Making it to the mun for the first time is such a satisfying feat while also being a catalyst that will lead you on a path of launching a space station to the outer reaches of the kerbol system. This game will bring the best inventor out of anyone and will inspire you to build the most amazing or wacky things you can think of. This game deserves more praise than I could ever give. 

Side note: The developers of this game have created a shining example of how early access should work. From being in pre alpha all the way to consistent updates past full release this game has had nothing but love and care put into it. Squad took input from the community and implemented mods and hired on modders to make the game better. This has culminated into the best space program sim to ever exist. Thanks squad!"

Kerbal Space Program,Simulation,220200,"When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly, all experience has shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.

But, when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature; a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing, with manly firmness, his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.

He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.

He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:

For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;

For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states;

For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;

For imposing taxes on us without our consent;

For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury;

For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses;

For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies;

For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments;

For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.

In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress, in the most humble terms. Our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.

We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that, as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually"

Kerbal Space Program,Simulation,220200,"Go in wanting to launch a rocket, leave with an understanding the complexities of orbital mechanics. 

This game is very good, personally it's my favorite PC game of all time. I've spent hundreds of hours building rockets and testing them in space and stuff. When I bought the game, I had a vague understanding of space, although I was fascinated nonetheless. For a very long time, all I knew was how to press the space bar to activate staging on a rocket. Getting into orbit seemed like something I could never achieve. The learning curve of this game is very steep, and you are probably going to need to watch tutorials to pull off ""basic"" missions. Eventually, you'll get the hang of basics, such as gravity turns, orbital rendezvous, deltaV budgeting, and much more. Once you understand all these strange, bizarre things, you are going to have a lot of fun putting your knowledge to the test. And by that, I mean pushing your poor little green astronauts to the absolute extreme.

Kerbal Space Program,Simulation,220200,Great game if you love rocket science or just love exploding things
Kerbal Space Program,Simulation,220200,"This is one of those classic games you remember seeing around or watching on YouTube but never got around to actually playing. If this accurately describes you, then I can definitely say: You're missing out.

This game is just a space sand-box/simulator. You control this race known as the Kerbal's, and just set out to expand your space program to the farthest reaches of the solar system. It's quite in depth as well, you can spend hours just designing your rockets, let alone flying them. When you finally feel satisfied with your rocket build, the physics in this game just feels right. Everything seems as it should.

If you have any interest in space, I definitely recommend this game. It has a bit of a learning curve for more of the advanced techniques, but it's learn-able. Most importantly, it's fun and rewarding to learn, or upgrade your space program. Check it out 8/10!"

Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"I have over 300 hours in this game, often playing it all day long. It's never crashed. It's never glitched out or corrupted my save game. I'm at the point where I've completed a Dyson Sphere and it's never dropped a frame despite multiple planets literally covered in production lines. Dyson Sphere Program  looks absolutely beautiful.

And it's in early access.

This game is a masterpiece of coding."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"I've tried out a decent few factory games before, and none of them have come even remotely close to catching my interest as much as Dyson Sphere Program. Factorio, for example, is a pretty clever game, and I don't mean to knock it, but I quickly lost interest because it didn't really feel as though there was anything cool to work towards. As in, it felt like the purpose of the factory was just the factory itself. There may have been some hazy end goal, but there was nothing in between to spark my awe- just endless automation.

Dyson Sphere Program takes the creative problem-solving/logistics planning aspects of the factory game genre and just, in my humble opinion, sparks it to its fullest potential (almost- there is always room for improvement, but we'll get there). In this game, you aren't [i]just[/i] automating things to be as efficient and organized and convenient as possible- you're still doing plenty of that of course, but along the way you also get to build incredible sci-fi devices. Launching thousands of solar sails to orbit around your nearest star to gather energy for you, upgrading your mech to travel between solar systems at warp speed, building vast networks of automated drones to deliver resources between planets for you- it's not solely about the planning, there are also actual moments of cathartic, exciting payoff that come to you frequently by just being an immensely cool game on a conceptual level.

If you are new to the genre (I am relatively new considering I gave up on others before overcoming their main hurdles), this game will be challenging to approach. I distinctly remember a point about six or so hours in where I [i]almost[/i] gave up and quit because I felt like there was just too much stuff to figure out at once and I didn't know my next step and I just had no idea where to go next. But I stuck it out and just started researching the coolest looking thing, and the next day (a weekend) ten hours went by of me playing and hardly noticing. So basically what you should take from this is that you should go into this game with the determination to overcome a steep learning curve, or just recognize that it's probably not your cup of tea.

Now, the negatives. I personally find space travel annoying and stressful. Being trapped in space, drifting into an infinite void with no hope in sight, scares me on a deep psychological level, so when I have to travel between planets with nothing but a finite tank of fuel and the possibility that I might accidentally miss my target and be slingshotted around its orbit into vast darkness, the rational part of my brain tells me I can just load a save, but the ape part of my brain is annoyed that my management game is now a horror game. I'd like a technology in the research tree that can shuttle the player automatically between planets, mostly for my own sanity.

The second thing is mostly a Early Access-type thing that I'm sure will be improved on in the future- I want more endgame tech to exist, like the ability to destroy entire planets to gain all their resources in one fell swoop, or create wormholes for instant teleportation between points in space, or create entire planet-sized space stations (yeah 2/3 of those suggestions is just describing the Death Star, deal with it); things like that which actually require access to the immense energy of a Dyson Sphere will add a ton more spice to the game (which of course already has plenty, but there can never be too much).

The final thing is actually something that is not in the game yet but will be- please don't add combat. I know I'm probably in the minority here but the game is complex enough without that on top of it. Maybe as like, a rare event in specific locations it would be fine but for it to be a constant nuisance that threatens to destroy parts of one's factory at any moment is just too annoying to even think about.

All in all, game looks visually incredible, haven't noticed a single substantial bug, very complex and interesting to play. If the idea of creating vast automatic factories that can create anything you want on a whim and can span multiple planets, with the goal of turning entire stars into your own personal generator intrigues you, I highly recommend giving this a try."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"""Oh, it's already 4 a.m."" Haven't had that in a while.

This game is a nice rabbithole of designing, optimizing and automating your acutal task of building spheres around stars. 
An important feature for me: This game does not rush you to do anything and you can completely play at your own pace. Fixing bottlenecks is a big part of this game, but they don't punish you in form of ""throwbacks"". Stuff just moves slower until you are ready for stuff to move faster. I guess this is what it would feel like, If life adjusted its speed to you.

Despite it's Early Access status, I'm not missing much, except for some minor QoL and insight into resource-production in the stats-page. And even those are in the works."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,Spacetorio
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"  I've always had a fascination with astronomy, engineering and physics but this took it to a new level. The idea of a dyson sphere was always one of the most alluring concepts to me as far as future tech was concerned. To live in a day and age where a society can collaborate so perfectly that it could create such a structure felt like a dream to me, but this game gave me a window into that dream. To be able to exist in world where even hypothetically, as a collective we can create a theoretical concept for the future, regardless of whether humanity will ever get there, it gives me a little hope for a possible future. 

  I never played games like this before. Builders and factory games were never something that even crossed my path, let one drew me in. But this game opened doors for me; gave me ideas. Plus the concept of being a lone individual with such a God like power to shape your part of the universe, carving out planets and owning stars, while you contribute to the whole of the galaxy along side other engineers in their own cluster is a very empowering idea.

  The gameplay mechanics are phenomenal. The limitless possibilities of factoring in resources from planets across multiple star systems. Planning to create massive structures with nigh infinite power at your disposal. Harnessing the power of the sun itself in the palm of your hands, then exploring further to touch another. 

  This game has so much potential and it's still only in early access. If you have a head for a game like this, or if you are looking to try something new it's definitely worth the inexpensive price tag. I dont think I've gotten this much out of many games for a very long time. I definitely think Freeman would be proud to know that his vision came to something of a realization so close to his lifetime."

Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"I've put in a ridiculous number of hours on this game since I purchased it a month ago and have restarted 3 times as I learned more about the mechanics.  I'm now about to begin my fourth restart with the release of the May update.  I don't think I could say enough about the beauty, depth and overall immersive nature of this game.  The graphics are stunning...standing on a distant planet, watching drones, interplanetary vehicles and  celestial objects all in motion at once while my solar sail projectors create a ring of sails around the local sun...just incredible!  So excited to start my next play-though and really scale this thing out...btw...that's the secret to this game.  Think strategically, but think really, really BIG!"
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"A really great game for any automation game fan.  

Tip: Your goal is to build a Dyson sphere, you should ignore the science research at some point. 

[b] The best:[/b]  Having a working grid system on a sphere is amazing, the performance is great with scaleable factories to multi-planitary scales, Hands down the most beautiful unity game I ever played.

[b] Things to improve: [/b] The construction bots feel underwhelming, It's tedious to construct the same connections (multiple mods have inproved this and the devs are working on it), Some recipes feel unnecessary complicated.

Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"This game is stunning. Everything is so well done. My only criticism is that there is so much they dont tell you.

Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"Let me compare this game to Factorio from my, subjective perspective.

While I always loved the concept of Factorio I never played it for long because it had a few critical flaws in my eyes: it was ugly, every run looked basically the same, it had no real goal at the end and - the worst - it wasn't rewarding - by that I mean you don't get cool things (with exception of drones, car and maybe weapons if you care to deal with critters), just more things to manage with even more complicated and tedious logistic management. I was always getting bored very fast and moved on to do something different.

Now, is Dyson Sphere Project better than factorio?

I think it is, at least for most cases. While there are no enemies, I don't think it is inferior to Factorio in this case - no fighting is better than bad fighting. 
The most important thing for me is that the game just feels more like it respect your time and enjoyment. You get constrution drones with big radius from the very start - if you want to make a conveor belt over the continent, you just need to designate start and end and then wait some time for your drones do to it. For smaller projects it's barely noticeable.
Finally, there are some goals you can actually see there - if you get this technology, you will be able to fly from star to star. How cool is that? This is something for which I am willing to play the game to get it. Of course it might not be enough for everyone but for me, it certainly is.

To conclude, do I recommend the game in current state? Yes. Do I think you should pay the full price for it? If you are like me, an engineering student with strong interest astronomy, yes. If not, wait some time."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"DSP is a damn awesome factory and logistics game, sure it's in early access and it needs more content  + polish. But as it stands at the present, it's bloody good despite being an early access game and well worth the price of admission. As despite the rather small worlds, the cluster wide exploration makes the game seem much bigger. 

You can now also free form make belts, so bring on the Satisfactory level belt spaghetti madness. 

It's also surprisingly optimised, since I'm running this on an ancient socket 775 set up with a CPU from 2008 and DD2 ram + a RX 570 4GB and unlike Satisfactory, it keeps on working when I go nuts on building stuff. And I like to go biiiiiiiiig on production. Which is why I have a 1.8GW solar sail swarm and 2 arrays of 18 energy exchangers now to power everything. 

Now is it as complex and deep as Factorio? Not yet, but the logistics stations take away the hassle and madness of train networks or the CPU hogs that are logistics drones. I'm sure though given DSP appears highly moddable, it will get an Angel/Bob style mod of madness for those craving moar logistics and production puzzles. 

Though like many of these games - you can easily play all night even with the ingame clock. Because the factory must grow :P So do what I try and remember to do and set yourself an alarm to remind you to sleeeeeeeep."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"you build things that produce things that can then be turned into better things

it makes me brain happy so i like this a lot yes"
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"Yeah it's alright. Barely adequate. Meh at best.... 
All kidding aside - this is annoyingly addictive. You start off building a little mall, that you end up liking. So you expand it, and expand it. Only to realize later that it was a poor choice because you're on a planet 10 ly away and you need more miners, smelters and what not. So you go back to the starter planet and rebuild into a logistics hub instead, and you will probably rebuild a couple of other things as well. You don't really notice time passing but now you've already spent 30 hours on this game alone. And you're nowhere near a Dyson Sphere yet. 
Also - this has to be the most bugfree game I've ever played - released or otherwise. Well done Youthcat"
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,Oddly addictive...
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,yES
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,What can I say about Dyson Sphere Program (DSP).... everything I love this game!!!! after 69 hr. I love how I can build from scratch and see the over view of everything on my world. I play a lot of this type of open world build sims and this is this is the one that got me into loving this type of game. I can't say enough about this game if you don't have it yet get it DSP is great for salving all my over engineering needs
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,Awesome loving the game and still going strong :) would definately recommend if you like factory type games
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,CANT STOP PLAYING!
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,If you like factory building. sandbox games and outer space. Then this game is the most incredible combination of all of those and the scale is unprecedented. I personally get every bit of ADHD enjoyment out of this game and I am gladsome people where insane enough to make it!
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"Honestly, this is an amazing game that have had a blast solving. It's extremely well thought out. The automation system is top notch and puts others games to shame.  About the only think I could complain about if I really tried hard is that there is no external threat, it's just a matter of time until you win. Nothing will attack or interfere, the threat of loss doesn't exist. That is such a minor complaint though, this is truly well done."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,Addictive and fun
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"impressive game indeed. 
Love the idea of automatic production. If only they have the control gate when the certain conditions are met , that would be better. 
But overall , i enjoyed the 100+ hours of playing. 
"
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"This game is insane. INSANE! I absolutely recommend it to anyone that is a fan of base building and economy. Also people who enjoy space traversal, planet exploration and rocket orbitals.

This game is impressive from front to back. Each planet has realistic looking terrain and elevation changes, there are fault and meridian lines that designate the curvature of the planet, the factory building is /BETTER/ than Factorio in my eyes. I was absolutely baffled when I got my first rail ejector to setup solar rails and found out that there are orbits you can set in this game for your satellites. You can see these satellites in the skybox as the planet rotates around and even fly and visit them.

The conveyor system is very good; you can craft items at the end of long crafting chains without having to queue up all the precursor blueprints manually as long as you have the basic resources; the automation is absolutely top notch with good logic... There's so much more.

This is a drivel of a review, it's all over the place but man... It is 100% GOTY and it's not even out of alpha yet. Absolutely recommend. In fact, I demand and require you get this game. Do it."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"Countles hours have been lost to this game, but not a minute of regret."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,Like if Factorio and Planetary Annihilation had a child together.... Except the learning curve isn't nearly as steep.
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,Most amazing factory game in space.
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,early access game already feels like a full game. amazing game will hook you for hours.
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,The type of game where you accidentally play for 22 hours in a day and don't even notice until you look at the timer on discord
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,A nice halfway point between the best bits of Factorio and Satisfactory.
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"I decided it would just a fun little quick factory redesign, spend maybe an hour tops then go to bed.

4 hours later, conveyor belts are everywhere, and I am starting to plan another expansion for more iron. And the redesign? lost to the voids of my mind as the clock strikes 2 a.m."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"Great fun stripping the star cluster from its resources to make energy. Some of the production humps to overcome are daunting, but with a plan, it's doable. The latest update to aid with placing sorters has brought me back to make a better cluster. If you like making production lines, this game is for you."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,Still pretty early with very rough edges but a very good competitor if you are a fan of Factorio and Satisfactory.
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"I love this game. Addictive as hell! I like the multiple logistical problems you will have to figure out. Excellent for a early access game, in fact I forget that it is early access a lot. for 20 bucks it is worth it!"

Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,Coolest game I've ever played
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"I once read that ""Factorio's complexity is the epitome of a perfect factory logistics game, and no other games could really surpass it without decades of development.""(paraphrased)

This game is proves that statement wrong in so many ways, and is truly a MASSIVE evolutionary step in the factory-building/logistic genre.

The game is SO beautiful, and the belt mechanics are amazing. It's 3 Dimensional, but unlike satisfactory, still uses a grid without the nasty first person perspective, and without sacrificing vertical weave-ability. I love Satisifactory (tho less than Factorio), and I love unreal engine (#RocketLeague), but for a logistics game, I don't think unreal was the right way to go with it. This game did the right thing by using unity, and as a result, has created a truly unique visual experience that is simply breathtaking, and all without the hallmark unreal engine behavior where the camera shows the inside of an entity's hitbox, ruining the immersion (*cough* Satisfactory).

Sure this game borrows a TON from Factorio, but it adds so much on top of it, it's far from a cheap copy. The sharing of ideas is how we grow as a society, and I love seeing the Factorio-esque genre of inspired games evolve so rapidly.

If you enjoy Factorio, you owe it to yourself to try this game for a 2-4 hours. You wont be disappointed.

About 40-70% better than Factorio.

10/10 Masterpiece"
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,The reason you don't see many reviews from people with hundreds of hours of playtime is because they are busy playing.
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"Got it last night, you can see how long i played"
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"For $20, this game is a steal. You can easily sink 100+ hours on a single playthrough, and even then you'll find that there's more to do. This is so much better than satisfactory when it comes to the factory aspect. Plus, while there may not be wildlife or enemies, I find looking at space, the stars, and my in-progress dyson spheres to be incredibly mesmerizing. Those golden rings filled with sails and the ever growing frame around a star is a sight to behold, something no other game can offer so beautifully. Plus there's the black holes, a special treat for those who are able to venture far enough.

 I wasn't a huge fan of automation or factory games, but this game got me hooked. If you find any enjoyment at all, even the tiniest bit, in building factories, get this. It's streamlined, beautiful, and surprisingly easy to handle and understand. You won't be tossed straight into a mathematical deep end. You'll be tossed into a glorious star cluster filled with unending resources and only one things to do: automate."

Basically: if you can think of a board/card game? Chances are somebody has uploaded the pieces via a mod in the ""Workshop."" There are lots of Discords and subreddits for finding people to play with, but of course this is a lot more fun to play with people you know (a lot friendlier, too, typically). Grab a buddy or two (or up to 10), and play all kinds of stuff! You've got typical classics like Monopoly, UNO, and Candyland; modern classics like Secret Hitler, Red Dragon Inn, and Cards Against Humanity; giant-scaled works like Gloomhaven, Eldritch Horror, and Betrayal at the House on the Hill; or you can even go extremely in-depth with wargames like D&D, Warhammer, or Pathfinder. Hell... these mods are so in-depth that people have built games just for TTS utilizing in-game physics, like pool, mini-golf, or kart-racing!

The opportunity is pretty darn bottomless, and with the Workshop still being updated almost weekly (if not daily)? Again: this game is a golden gift to you (and your friends) socially-distanced game-nights. If you have friends or family far away or abroad? Try out TTS. You won't regret it!"

Farming Simulator 19,Simulation,787860,make ram ranch a dream come true by plowing all your friends in the beautiful farm fields of crops blowing in the gentle wind
Farming Simulator 19,Simulation,787860,"This is third Farming Simulator version I have bought (also 15 and 17).  I have grown to like this one more than the earlier ones.  It brings back memories of my grandparents working their farm, though without all the equipment (they used a mule). One of my grandfathers eventually bought a Ford tractor, the other bought an International Harvester.  I can remember him tying a wooden pallet to the back of the tractor and pulling two of my cousins and I around the farm, which we thought was awesome.  If you have any interest in farming, business management, or simulating the long hours of often back breaking but rewarding work a farmer does, this is the game for you. You also will not find a game much better supported by modders than this one.  The only thing it is missing is the farmer's wife bringing a pitcher of cold lemonade to him in the field."

Farming Simulator 19,Simulation,787860,This is a very fun game if you are in to farming. I personally like to add mods into the game to make it a little more reallistic.

Farming Simulator 19,Simulation,787860,really good game. cant wait for 2022
Farming Simulator 19,Simulation,787860,"Farming Simulator 19 is the latest installment in the ""Farming Simulator"" Franchise from GIANTS. If you've ever played Farming Simulator 15, and thought: ""This is great but I wish it was XYZ"" Then Farming Simulator 19 has it covered. From Difficulty Options, to Modular Parts and Upgrades, and even Trains, Female Farmers, and yes horses to ride; it is an improvemennt in every way. Some people have complained about FPS Issues but I have suffered nothing of the sort to be honest. Let me break down some pros/cons from Farming Simulator 15 (which I have also played):

Pros:

-More Realistic in almost every way.
-Yes there's a difficulty option for that. (and you don't even have to restart the game to change them)
-Horses, Cows, Chickens, AND Pigs for Animal ""Husbandry""
-Railroads and Trains
-Easy access to Mods
-Build your own Farm, one silo, one field at a time (full customization)
-3 Ways to start a new save: New Farmer (Some Starter Stuff and a little land/Normal), Start from Scratch (Start with nothing and a little capital/Hard), or Farm Manager (Start with a lot of capital but nothing else/Easy)
-You *finally* have somewhere to sleep.

Cons:

-In a sterotypical GIANTS approach the EU Maps are much more organized and easier to navigate than the American Maps (which is reverse of Real Life imo)
-Roosters are a cosmetic Resource Sink (Hens lay eggs without Roosters)
-""Docking"" Parts together can be a bit weird on occasion; especially if you've never driven RWS/FWD Cars or messed with Trailers in your real life. (This may somewhat be influenced by my own lack of a drivers license to begin with :P)
-In Practice the Game is open ended, but what do you do once you own all the lands? The Overarching Logical Objective is to be as rich as possible.
-You are not tired enough to sleep.

Overall: 6/10 for a game in general, 8/10 for a farming game, and 19/19 for the Farming Simulator Franchise."

7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"With the amount of improvements this game has seen over the last few years, I can say this is quite enjoyable.

If you're looking for a ""new"" game to play with friends, this might do the trick. Easy to invest many hours into."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"I cannot recommend this game. It's been 8 years, released 2013, it is now 2021. I'll give it some credit that it has gone through some graphical change, and some features were added...

But I don't recommend it because...

I used to mod and write codes for this game, but every other year they would change it and everything will go to hell, or you lose your world's data. And this kept happening. In about 2018, I stopped playing it and so did my community because our beautiful and largely created world that we stayed on for 4 years (This game is like minecraft) had finally failed.

We had a underground tunnel network to go from one major city to another. We had a pvp arena and everything. A large underground Hive similiar to Resident Evil (The movie). We had a death pit where people could stay on horde night (Every 7 days). We made gigantic fortified skyscrapers, all kinds of things. Custom mods (That we made ourselves) with our small team of devs, and more.

We even had ingame faction npcs and players (You register to a faction, and if you were killed you'd drop your factions coin that an enemy faction could turn in for exclusive loot via reputation in your own faction).

We even made respawns for loot, trees, and other resources- so that we would have indefinite resources in the world (Example, respawning boulders that would give you little bit of everything, cars that would self-respawn, etc)."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Was waiting for over 10 minutes to create a world, 5 minutes to connect and after connection the game crushed.
10/10 would wait again"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"For a game in Early Access, this is pretty great! Not only is this the best zombie survival game ever, but the way you can configure the game is amazing. Want a game without a blood moon? click a button. Want easier or harder zombies? Click a button. Want longer or shorter days? Click a button. The game is so configurable that the game can be configured any way you want. And once you start the game, you can reconfigure it anytime you want. Game getting too easy? Click a button. Getting too hard, click a button. You can tailor the game any way you want it. Not just the way they created it. 

And to top it all off, they are not done! There have been other games (like Empyrion) that will tell you they are still adding to the game and never do. When this game get's an update, it GET'S AN UPDATE! I bought this game now because the next update A20 is coming out soon. And when it does, it will be like playing a whole new game again...

Definitely worth the money!"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"It's somewhat ironic, that a group of developers that call themselves ""The Fun Pimps"" have taken it upon themselves to create a game that is as devoid of fun as the landscapes are barren in their game. As I write this review, the game is on sale at £5.69 GPB (normal price £18.99 GBP). Would I recommend it at the same price, unlikely. The full asking price? Absolutely not. Don't bother. It's only interesting for a couple of days, then you realise it's the same old, tired, (and at this point 8 YEAR) formula over and over. The devs have made their fortune, and now they are content coasting by on it, with no real motivation or drive to push out any meaningful, fun, innovative content. The latest slap in the face? So-called ""Twitch integration"" that no-one wants, let alone needs. It's Early Access, Alpha 20. Twenty incremental updates spanning 8 years. The ""Road Map"" of new features and content? They removed it because they weren't delivering on it, so it was easier to just not commit to anything. And don't you dare mention the road map or lack of updates in the forum, because if the devs don't ban you, the mods will, because they are oh-so-touchy and can't handle the critisim that is directed towards this game from so many people. The environments are static, never changing. Optimisation is non existent (but again, don't you dare mention this in the forums!). I was even told outright by a dev in the forum it was REASONABLE to wait in excess of 33 minutes for a map to load on my rig which is an i9-9900k, 2080ti, 64GB ram, nvme m.2 drive. Crazy. It's 2021, you should be expecting more from the games you play, don't settle for less, and certainly not at a whopping £18.99 GBP, you can get better games with better graphics, that are more fun to play, don't suffer extreme FPS drops when multiple enemies spawn on screen etc...This is a sand-box of a game, where you play the same formula over and over, the only difference is a cat has soiled in this sand box before you even begin."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good mix of survival, crafting, zombie hordes and looting. The skill-trees are well thought out (after some initial misfires) and the crafting system isn't overly complicated or difficult.  The zombies are disturbingly satisfying to kill with several variations and increasing levels of power. The post-apocalyptic setting and base building will tickle the fancy of any doomsday prep fantasy. The looting satiates desires you never you had and is cheaper than buying RL lotto tickets. I have played thousands of hours and watched many hours be played (mostly by Neebs Gaming) and still enjoy my time playing this game. The only thing that can get a little frustrating is updates that remove certain small aspects that were enjoyable."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Great game with a pretty huge community. 

-man of few words XD"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"This game is just incredibly fun. The heart, love and commitment by the developers shows through and through. Although its been out for awhile, there are regular updates and improvements so the game never ages. It never feels dated or gets tiresome. It is vastly layered, hyper creative, enormously entertaining and positively challenging without being a grind. Few games achieve what 7 Days to Die has and it will stand out for years to come as the very best in the entire genre. Playing with friends adds another layer of tremendous entertainment. Highly recommended."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,Its a really great game that I play with my family. Very fun as a multiplayer game!
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"I followed the name of the game and my first death was on the seventh day. my friend however died many times prior.

very good game if you like to sink a good bit of time into survival and gathering. Easily one of the best zombie survival games I have ever played."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Good fun with friends. Exploring, scavanging and surviving the hord nights."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Best zombie game out there as of now, i say as of now because i am in hope that someone will surpass them. This game has everything you would want in a survival zombie game and a good community to boot. Many servers active still and some good mod devs out there making the game ever more fun than before. Well worth the buy."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Absolutely love this game! I've been playing since Alpha 16, about 2 years ago, with my friends and re-visited it again recently. I have to give props for the zombie appearances being remodeled and new items added :). If you love base building, a post-apocalyptic setting, zombies running around and chasing after you, and an open-world where you loot and gather resources, this is the game for you. 

My one and only issue, and I'm guessing this may have been raised by others, is that it is somewhat buggy and lags from time to time and I'm sure given that it is still in it's Alpha phase - for many years now xD - it will get better. Looking forward to future updates and hope this games continues to stay solid and deliver amazing content and game play with every new patch update!"

7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,Really fun for solo or with friends
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"first off this game is not likely to be released in full, its been in alpha for years but that doesn't make it a bad game, on the contrary its a great game, i have 400 hours in it and haven't gotten bored yet, its constantly being updated and every so often its given a big update that refreshes everything, i was unfortunate enough to be a console player and eventually when i picked this up on pc the difference was night and day! if you get into this game and your a mature player looking for a great game to play with friends that doesn't involve some 15 year old cod lunatic calling you a multitude of insults then this is a game you can enjoy!"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,A good survival crafting game with a bit of a learning curve. It is a good idea to run from zombies if you are just starting out.

"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Eh, it's okay."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"One of the only ""survival"" games I will keep returning to.

With open world survival being FLOODED by so many titles it can be hard to find the one that best fits what you want from the genre. 

Difficulty can be a pro or con (but you can always set your servsers/worlds up to be easier)

Sky and earths core are the limit!
Literally can dig/mine tunnels and cavern systems out of mountains or the ground itself!

NO JUNK ITEMS
Every item you pick up is used for  something. I love that even the smallest items can hold value in the game.

Hunger/Thirst 
At first it can be tough to manage your hunger/thirst levels but don't worry once you're a little more established you barely even remember struggling with hunger ;)

Lot's of ways to construct bases and traps for zombies. Every 7 days (you can change when the blood moon happens) theres a big red moon and it gets scary defending your base from an onslaught of zombies and other creatures.

Lots of character leveling and progression. Also you can get quests from in game and from NPC traders (really has some solid RPG elements )

I bought this game VERY early access and the Dev team has been putting in serious love and effort into this title. From where it started it was a fun and playable game, but where it is now is an ABSOLUTE GEM of a game. There's just so many skills to master, and so much world to discover. 

I would recommend this game 9/10"

Kelly can't find her cursor for her computer and this frustrates her because she really wants to play this game. She sounds angry."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"The game is fun! It has a good way to build bases and good terrain destruction. I really wish they added more stuff thats electrical. And probably more types of zombies. Besides that everything is really good. 
Except for the one flaw that zombie animations are sometimes off, when they are stunned but insta hit you without an animation, other than that really good!! I Recomend!"

it's called 7 days to die but it only took 3"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,pretty interesting crafting survival game. graphics are a bit clunky tho
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"if your a fan of zombies and survival games then this is definitely for you! I started playing this game on ps4 and I believe the devs stopped supporting the console version back in 2017, which is when I stopped playing the game. I'm now revisiting the game in 2021 on PC and i do enjoy all the updates that have happened since I been away from the game. I also like the game more on PC. Its fun and it has some built in customization options for your game like the XP multiplier. I think I will try modding it also."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"[h1]Do you like Minecraft? Add guns, Traps,  a Zombie Apocalypse and 3D graphics and you have 7D2D! Easily one of my favorite games. What are you waiting for? Go buy it NOW!!! 9/10[/h1]"

7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,THE ZOMBIES HAVE HUGE JUGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"CAUTION BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!
I have this game also on Xbox but I recently switched over to pc and oh my baby J, these glitches need to be fixed pronto, was fighting mad dogs and out of no where I couldn't swing anymore and died... Now maybe its because I still use my controller to play on pc but the sensitivity is AWFUL! Turning takes dang near 20 years, another problem THAT'S SO FREAKING ANNOYING I COULD SCREAM is, say you're fighting a Z and I mean going to town on their big empty forehead ""boom"" ""boom"" ""chow"" ""pow"" and out of no where while they're on the ground the body glitches and the big Bertha and her friend skinny Shirley smack attack you and you're infected LIKE WHAT SENSE DOES THAT EVEN MAKE. And before you lames get all ""its in the alpha stage, that's why its glitchy"" News flash I already know -_- In conclusion, if you get this game you'll love it if you're into zambie games. p.s beware of glitches. 7/10 would highly recommend."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,Good game but extremly harf if you are new.
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,the nurse zombies lookin kinda yummy though
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"very nice survival game. Its like rust but has more customization, multiplayer servers not recommended tho. Most fun when played with friends."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,pubg mobile type graphics but it pretty fun doe
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"The vastness of the game the inclusion of a background story helping you move along and survive by gaining xp. The freedom in the skill tree and the learning of knowledge by playing over time and finding new books with new information. The in depth building and including caver ins when mining. The depth of realism this game try to include while still making it clear its in its own universe, It all adds up to one amazing game that even tho still in alpha is more well polished than half the games i have ever played. It's more fun with more people for sure however you are able to solo quite well i have solo'd the last 66 days on my world and am still motivated to continue progressing and improving my character and base. It's a journey all of it's own and no two worlds are ever the same."

If you're looking for a challenging survival horror zombie game, this is it, absolutely amazing, 10/10"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Have you ever had a nightmare that you could not wake from?

7 Days to Die is an in-depth survival/crafting/horror game with a lot of potential mileage underneath the hood. Just like any real-world emergency situation, its always a good idea to try and have a friend or a few friends along for the ride. This game has been in Alpha for quite some time, but finally its 'gold' or finished state is on the horizon. What that entails is the game hopefully having mod support through steam and not 3rd party websites (which is something I've never really been comfortable with). 

Lately, there has been a lot of graphics updates to the game, hence its raising pricetag. I'd suggest getting it sooner rather than later, especially on a sale. If you think of the game Rust, which forever sat at the 10-15 dollar range until in a staggeringly short time period it shot up to 40....7 Days to Die is in that same category of early access games. 

There are many ways to play this game, and I personally would recommend roleplaying as a certain type of survivor with each playthrough. Do you have a small, consolidated base which is easier for a single person to maintain and defend...or do you go for more of the expansive type just to see how long before critical failure is upon you? With the various skill points and weapons that go hand in hand with said skills, there's no wrong way to play the game. 

Food rapidly becomes critical, especially if you're not playing alone. You might just have a hidden green thumb. 

With the expansive biomes, I would also advise acquiring some kind of transportation in order to search out for any survivors, or more importantly, loot....but there's only so much time during the day, and being caught unawares in unfamiliar territory can rapidly lead to a crisis situation.

Do you have what it takes to struggle against the ever present cycle of zombies that press the attack in mega hordes every 7 days upon you? 

Graphics: The game has its own unique look and feel, and is being updated regularly 
7.5+/10
Gameplay: Interaction with the many objects, including craftables
10/10
Combat: Where did I put those extra bullets?
10/10
Time Investment: The game is in Alpha, and technically does not have an endgame
10/10 (if you replay it in different ways with different immersive factors)
6/10 (if you play through it once)
PvP: Yes, the game has PvP
Your skill and ability to endure public games/10 (you get what you get in those, much like pandora's box)

Hope this review is helpful, would highly recommend"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"There are so many things about this game that make it good that it would be hard to break them all down without writing a book.

Complex building system on par with minecraft if not even more customizable.

Voxel Terrain so you can mine tunnels under your house as an escape route.

The 7 day invasion system give you a reason to build.  Each 7 days the attack gets a little more intense so you have to continually upgrade your defenses and actually think about how to keep yourself alive.

Leveling and Skill trees that actually do stuff to make your character builds different.

Exploration is awesome.  There are hundreds of houses each with it's own thing going on.  There is very little if any copy pasta.  

Crafting, Mining, breaking down cars and appliances for parts...

It's the little things and the attention to detail that sets this game apart from all the others.  Like the way you see the lightening flash and hear the thunder a few seconds later instead of immediately along with the flash.    This game is full of little things like that which will keep you focused and interested for a long time.

TL; DR  Do you like fun that involves thinking and skill?  Then play this game."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"I already loved this game on Playstation 4 but sadly it never got any updates. Bought a gaming pc last month and one of my first purchases was 7 Days to Die again. It's one of my favorite games ever. The atmosphere is amazing, the crafting and building options almost endless. The graphics are great just the way they are. Nobody should expect a masterpiece though. The maps are huge and you always seem to find and explore something brand new. The quests you find throughout the game will keep you busy during the week if you're not preparing for the hordes that come every seven days - because trust me, you have to make sure your place is safe and ready for them. The hordes itself are definitely a challenge in the beginning, but managable once you got good guns. But the best thing out of everything is the fact that you can play with friends. My nights haven't been boring anymore since I got my friends to buy the game too. We're having tons of fun, I highly recommend."

The friggin 7 days is just me trying to load the damn thing. i've even fallen asleep waiting for it to load with just the music in the background.  I am within minimum specs to that is not the issue. ive tried reinstalling, verifying game files, running as admin, and nothing works!!  This sucks.  I can run it on xbox and it's so fun but on my pc with steam....Nothing!!  This blows and i would just recommend playing on a console rather than pc."

7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"This game is mediocre at best...

I used to be on Xbox a few years ago and had 7 Days To Die and rebought it a week ago. Literally haven't noticed a single difference aside from new items and a shop (which teleports you in front of zombies if you go near it at night). 
Starting off is horrible for the simple fact that melee in this game is SO BAD, so enjoy walking around with broken bones for the first few days and low health because of it. Movement feels so slow as well and you can't drive 95% of the vehicles you come across. 

Building in this game is extremely mundane and takes forever to gather resources. Unlike other survival games, you actually have to gather twice as much materials to build because you have to place a frame and then upgrade the frame to get a tile (what is this, 2013?) oh wait, that's right this game HAS been in alpha since 2013 which is quite sad. Developers are extremely slow at updating this game as well. I hope you like horrible graphics that'll never get updated because this game looks exactly the same as it did when I played on Xbox One in 2013. Don't let the screenshots fool you either, watch youtube gameplay of this game and you'll see exactly what I mean. This game is laggy for some reason too even though I run a 1660 TI, i7 9th gen, 32 gb Ram, SSD. 

If you're looking for a zombie experience, LOOK ELSEWHERE. Left 4 Dead is a way better option than this piece of sh*t. I thought I'd give this game another try but was quickly reminded how bad this was. This is a dollar tree version of Ark but with zombies (Ark released way after this game too which is even more sad for 7DTD). I should've bought Days Gone instead. I don't think I'll bother trying to progress in this game until I decide to grind for achievements. 

TLDR; Mediocre game with 2013 graphics and gameplay, everything looks the same from 2013, melee combat sucks, feels way too tedious to progress any further. Probably won't update this review until I decide to go for all the achievements which will be the last thing I do in my library."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"i miss the old style of crafting/ doing actions to level up.. i get why you did the change.. but it seemed more realistic, make 100 stone axes and u learn to make them pretty good quality"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,one of the best survival game
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,Great game. Just wish you could get a dog like in fallout.
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,So this game is difficult to start. But a very rewarding experience if you play it with friends. It keeps you busy and there is always something happening or to do. Sometimes it's serious and other times it's just stupid fun. Would recommend it for anyone that likes zombie survival crafting games.
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,Great game is only getting better!
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,fun af def worth buying when on special
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,Game stuck in alpha never finished sad.
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,I walked into a room and had a zombie lady crash out a closet and fall on her face. 10/10
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"""Early Access"" for 8 years. At this point steam should be obligated to refund. Alpha 19!? What a joke"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,love the game and i wanna learn more and play with more people
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"The game has a lot to do and the crafting/building aspects of the game are fun.
Zombies are a little underwhelming in difficulty but you can join servers that makes your experience more challenging."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"I keep coming back to this game because it's fun, but I keep getting driven away by the constant save game corruption issues. There is no manual save/load option in game, and the autosave will randomly cause a crash where it resets all your progress. This has been an issue forever and there has been nothing done about it. Losing 70+ hours of progress is unacceptable, and being told the solution is to constantly manually copy/paste files is poor product support. This could all be easily fixed by adding a manual save/load feature like every single other game in the history of gaming has had. Either that or rotating/incremental autosaves instead of one that always overwrite the previous one. Cannot recommend."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,Boredom/chore simulator. Have to spend 90% of your time not starving so you can move more than 20 seconds without catching your breath.
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,I like the ability to create and build. Killing zombies is fun too!
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Tried to play with a Ryzen 9 3900XT paired with an RTX 3070 an somehow can't get over 50 fps on this game. Sometimes it even drops to the 30s.... Barely using my CPU or GPU and I have looked all over the internet for solutions with not much luck. People with extremely high end PCs seem to be running into this issue as well, I hope it gets addressed soon cause this is pretty unacceptable even for a game that is ""early access""."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,It's pretty cool. Zombies go rawr
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,frame drops
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"This was, at one point, one of my go to games. Loved everything about it. But the developers can’t seem to lock in on the building parts, as well as other game aspects, so after spending 40+ hours building your super zombie proof base, you can NOT transition into the next version, because 9 out of 10 times they have tweaked something, and half your base ends up on the ground or just gone. This might have changed, but when I post that question to the boards, the reply was, 

 “Q3: Do I have to start over with the new Alpha? Can I still play my old saved games? Will they be deleted? 
A: Your saved games are only expected to work with the Alpha you were playing when you started them. If you don’t want to start over, you can roll back to that earlier Alpha to play your old saved games - see previous question. An update will not delete your saved games.” 

So, if you have no problem starting over every time a new release comes out, then this game is AWESOME, but it now, like take my money now. Otherwise, you might want to wait."

7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,its a great game all in all but the problem is that (at least for me) you Cant make a randomly generated world. its an option but the game Crashes. (and ive CheCk youtube and google) so if your ok with playing the same map all the time then go ahead. but if you want something new this isn't the game for you
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,Gud game. But you need to buy some DLC to make it really playable so that's kinda shit.
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,The fact that they took out existing functionality of federations and then put it back in as a DLC is a good example of how paradox has lost it's way.
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,it is ok
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"I've been everything at this point.

I've created utopia personified, grand architectures of the combined might of thousands.
I've wiped out the galaxy, ended untold trillions of lives.
I've burned, cracked, erased, pacified and converted entire worlds.
I've uncovered ancient mysteries and dead civilisations.
I've fostered friendships and alliances, federations that dominated the galaxy through cooperation.
I've been destroyed by the hubris of resisting a steel tide, been devoured by eldritch swarms and absorbed by ancient extradimensionals. 
I've seen stars collapse under the weight of a shared ambition and ideal, and watched as the heavens are torn asunder by the gods themselves.
I've put my iron boot to the neck of all xenos scum, and made them sing praises to a corpse throne.
I've sung the tones of the damned, and collected all lifeforms to ascend into my image, and my image alone.
I've done unspeakable things in the name of profit.
I've reshaped the galaxy through unseen and deft diplomatic hands, enstated myself emperor and made all bow to my will.
I've reshaped nations, empires and fought blood drenched civil war against myself.

I have been a learned scholar.
I have been a fervent zealot of the shroud.
I have been a champion of the people, and of freedom.
I have been the god emperor, the one above all, the autocrat and philosopher king.
I have been the oppressor and the puritan, the blood court and the exterminator.
I have been the diplomat, and the seeker of the spurned, the creator of alliances.
I have been the crusader, the unending tide of war and the admiral of an eternal fleet.
I have been the timorous oak, the defender and developer of utopia.
I have been the confluence of thousands of minds and voices, a devourer of worlds, a parasite or a simple mind.
I have been the metal horde, speaking in a chorus of binary tones and logic- an exterminator of flesh, a curator of the lesser, and a twisted all encompassing matrix.

I have seen the end, and i laughed for it held my image, and the reflections of thousands of iterations before this one.

I've been everything at this point.

Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"strategy goverment-based gameplay in space, most of it takes place in map view and if you're looking for a space-age shooter or naval combat, this ain't it."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"The game was once really good. At version 1.9 or so. But then they decided to rework the whole population and resource system which totally breaks the game. soon after start the game slows down coz even a strong pc cant keep up all the unessesary calculations anymore. so at mid game, on a medium sized map the game becomes totally unplayable because all you do is wait and wait and wait. yes you can set the game speed to max. but the game will always be just as fast as the calculations are done. 

Multiplayer is also not advised. 1. most servers are empty, coz nobody plays it so broken and when you find a server without a password, the game is only running on normal speed at best. So sending a research ship to the next solarsystem feels like realtime. 

Very poor from paradox that they continue to fuck the game up and push out addons that are not even half finished. 
"
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,easiest paradox game with pretty good replay value... need more hours before I can truly judge though

Stellaris,Strategy,281990,Super captivating and fun. Def would recommend to any gamers interested in colony building games.
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"I have spent a stupid amount of time playing Stellaris. Coincidental catastrophes---like Awakening Empires at the same time as the Grey Tide is released and extra-dimensional horrors show up---are a great challenge to try & survive (which I didn't in that particular case...) If you love 4X games, you'll love Stellaris."

Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Great game, It has infuriating learning curves that require you to look up online how stuff works because it does the WORST job explaining it. Some things don't even do what they literally say they do. Pretty buggy. And the worst part is that half the game is behind 150$+ WALL OF DLC'S wich is the worst most irremediable way to put a game out. So too bad about the company. But fun game otherwise."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Glad there's finally a game for me to vent all my genocidal frustration. I was getting bored of starting cultural-conflicts between the ants that reside in the broken pipeline underneath my basement. Thanks for the cool game, I will reference such a product in my upcoming radical manifesto."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,This game is pure gold in my opinion. Just wish I had more time to play it.
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,good but too many DLC
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"fun with mods! :) it isn't too difficult to mod via workshop, at least it isn't like skyrim's bs spaghetti code

No in reality it's a great game in the standard 4x way, I have done loads in this and still have more stuff and adventures to find. Only negative is how laggy it is in late game other than that it's great"
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,The best 4X on the market for my money.
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Very good sci-fi 4X/RTS game overall. However, keep in mind that this is a Paradox Interactive game so you will need to spend at least $100 on DLC in order to get fun out of it. Thankfully most of the DLC will go on sale sometimes either on Steam (or Humble Bundle which is even better) and you can get it for real cheap. 

To make this game playable you will absolutely need most of the DLCs, it is incredibly bland and genuinely unplayable without them. However,  if you have the money to buy this game I'd say its worth it on sale. "
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Newbie here.  The Vanilla game works great.  Now, I just have to wait for ST New Horizons to update and I'll be off at warp speed!  I'll be gaming Stellaris for quite some time to come.  Thank you Paradox for making a great game."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"It gets very boring. Early game is fun, finding planets colonizing planets finding factions etc, Middle game is hell, All your doing is building ships and building up planets, Boring as all hell. I couldnt get to late game because of how boring middle game is."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,Indiscriminate Orbital Bombardment™
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Cool game, cool idea, but as with most paradox games intentional design decisions make it a chore to play (IE war exhaustion) It pains me that I can own quite literally almost every single system of an opposing empire, and still can't sue them for peace. Despite having double their fleet size and double their tech. My experience with PvP is limited, but at least a player may know when to cut their losses. The AI is beyond unbearable, and so unbelievably stupid that its only chance to beat a player is its resource cheats early on. Even with all of that, the game itself is very interesting, and has lots of interesting scenarios and encounters, and the anomaly system is amazing. I would make this review positive if it weren't for war exhaustion, which adds nothing to the game but a speedrun timer for wars."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,This game will steal all your time.  Don't start you won't be able to stop.
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"TLDR: I own all the expansions for this, am VERY happy with my purchase, and LOVE this game.  BEST space strategy game by a LONG shot, and I'll go so far as to say best strategy game overall as well.

Read through some other reviews lately for this and the expansions and my mind is blown at people complaining about content.  This game is more different today than it was at launch than other space strategy games are from game 1 and 2.  ALL of those patches and updates are free...  Soooo lack of content?  Are these people insane?  Now one part that I WILL point out, commonly Paradox puts out a massive patch with their expansions and gives away a ton of the content for free.  And then they only paywall a small portion.  Now if ALL you were looking at is what is behind the paywall, it may not add too much.  But if you look at the entire rest of the update that they GAVE AWAY FOR FREE, then the expansions add a ton.

With that part in mind, if you're NEW to this game, you might want to wait for a steam sale.  The expansions commonly will be dirt cheap and a great time to pick things up.  I look at the expansions honestly as a way for me to say thanks to Paradox for a game that I've legitimately sunk thousands of hours into.  

Final note: the community mods are fun to mess around with too.  Some can change the game drastically, and some are just a blast.  Keep in mind not all of them are multiplayer friendly though."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"yes, yes and yes.... cool mechanics and visuals.
"
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"So I've been playing the base game in single-player, and have had the pleasure of playing the DLC in multiplayer, so I feel confident to write a review here.

Firstly, the negatives:
There are still some crash issues when it comes to multiplayer, however it seems a lot better than in the past.
The DLC, while shared in multiplayer, is incredibly expensive for what it offers.
War can be mildly frustrating when you're aiming to take over the universe, why? You can spend 30 minutes flying your fleets around, taking over every planet that an entire federation owns, but because you declared you wanted one specific empire as a vassal, all that work goes away. You still have to do it, however, if you want the war to be ""Victorious"" because the war points are determined by the entire defending civilisations rather than the one you wanted to vassal. It can be quite infuriating.
If one enemy fleet gets into your empire somehow, they can fly around and take over several of your systems, because your own army will be unable to catch up. If you don't have spare armies for a pincer attack you'll likely lose and recapture your entire civilisation every time you go to far, multiplied if you have vassals to defend.
A lot of the DLC elements seem like they'd be amazing base game additions, and some such as robotic civilisations make you wonder why they weren't added at the start, again the prices are intense.
The base game feels like it lacks many peaceful victory conditions, I have not discovered any as of yet however taking over systems seems to always come down to war, you can't seem to befriend someone into submission, though you can form federations.



The positives:
Stellaris is a fun game, whether your first time playing at normal speed to enjoy all the story elements and roleplay your favourite space fairing civilisation from Star Trek to Star Wars, to your own creations, or your hundredth game min-maxing all your elements to try and achieve the peak of your empire.
Whenever you feel like you understand the game, something will go wrong, and you'll learn a valuable lesson.
Stellaris is the game of menus, but unless things go horribly wrong you'll only really see 10% of them.
Having to try to balance what empires you wish to befriend, which are threats and which aren't, is quite fun, though can get confusing when there's a lot of empires.
The balancing of resources to ambition is well-handled, with influence points forcing you to expand to key locations, but alloys preventing you from taking over every system instantly. 
Multiplayer is a lot of fun, whether you're secretly stealing your other player's technologies or charging in with a 30k fleet to finally free them of the pirate fleets they spawned next to. Whether you wish to team up or destroy one another, it can be quite fun!
The DLC is enjoyable. While it feels expensive and toys with you by having tiny elements such as Gather Information in the base game, the gameplay it adds is entertaining. Being able to play a giant robotic empire who suddenly decides to become the galaxy-ending scenario and starts to charge an undefeatable army throughout the system collapsing star systems into black holes as you go is an incredible rush after all the build-up it takes, and discovering an AI has a 100k fleet by a wormhole into your territory gives you a rush of adrenaline as your armies flee back in the vain hope of holding it off. The game has a great flow of power with DLC's, though can feel a little flat without them after you've experienced them.
The DLC story elements can be awesome, such as discovering a planet locked in a time loop just before its destruction, or an ancient lovecraftian horror guarding a black hole, or an ancient civilisation just looking for a home and joining your people. This really helps give the game more replayability which the base game does lack in comparison. 

This game has elements for basically everyone, though many players don't play Ironman mode considering the achivement for victory is 5%."

Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"I didn't get to see much of the game to give a real review. So, just want to leave this as a warning for others like me. 
Something about the game triggers my anxiety. I felt very weird while playing it. An the same thing happened when I played the game Stardrive 2. Which is very similar. 
So if you are sensitive to certain light patterns - be careful with this game. 

Looked pretty, and had lot of depth from what little I saw. So, will give it an up for that."

Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"For some reason, I thought sterrlrious would be great by itself without the DLCs. Again I was wrong. The base game hardly works as the AI is incapable of building a proper economy. The AI also breaks when assigned to automatically take after settlements. Its the equivalent of taking care of 100 strong holds in CK2. In all, the base game doesn't work as is surely not worth any dollar amount. Its just a scam for the company to milk the DLC's."

Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Stellaris is a grand 4x space game that you get sucked into.  I have played maybe 10 games so far, and I still find many new things to learn and try each game.  In short it is a serious time sink, but of the good kind.   Do be warned that the learning curve is not shallow and youtube and discord will be your friends in that regard."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Fantastic grand strategy game with a ton of replayability. Definitely recommend some youtube videos to get the most out of it, but it's great!"
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,The sheer number of decisions one can make while playing this game can be overwhelming but at the same time its simple to pick up and learn.
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Stellaris is a great game, in contains a lot of content (and can be expanded with the numerous DLCs) and has an indepth moding community that add so much more (whether balanced or unbalanced).

Look forward to sitting down at your computer and then realising half a day passes before you know it."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Basically Civ, but in space. The expansions keep changing the gameplay, and I feel like over time, it's gotten more balanced as a game. I feel it's a good game, but I do get annoyed that I can only get achievements in solo mode."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Strike Craft is such a strange setup, like a bunch of kayaks loaded with machine guns shooting enemies in a naval battle.
Why not just try to convert these Strike Craft into shipboard engineering ships? Use a lot of engineering drones in combat to repair ships in the fleet, and then use cyclic technology to increase the speed of repairs?"
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Like so many others I can't say enough good things about Stellaris, so what I will say is that if it interests you seriously consider buying it. If the price isn't right for you wishlist it and wait for a sale. Stellaris has been a great way to unwind for me and a wonderful way to connect with friends in my life."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,A Fabulous 4X strategy game that includes hours of fun.
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,$180 in DLC for this game. That is just ridiculous. Blatant money grab most are way over priced for what they are.
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Stellaris suffers from what every other Paradox game suffers from - complexity creep. 

The original 1.0 release saw a game that had the markings of a classic Paradox 4x game - different facets of administration (government ethics), factions, simplified resource management (two main types that are acquired in a not-roundabout way), base management in the form of population controls, etc. There was enough to keep you engaged, and assigning automated systems once your empire got large enough kept you going forward from there. Every aspect of the game was accessible from a tooltip or the advisor - there was no mystery as to how you got your resources and there was no myriad spiderweb of information to dig through to see why your population was being impacted by what was affecting it. Diplomacy was fairly straightforward, warfare was fairly straightforward, research..everything was accessible, and while there was a depth to it, you didn't need to search far for your answers.

That has since changed. With the 3.0 update the top of the screen is now half-covered with information about different types of resources to manage; from the base two expanding out to the more amorphous types such as unity and administration. While you can construct buildings on your planets to seemingly affect these resource incomes..its not entirely clear what benefits are output from these buildings, or which buildings your populations now work in while 'jobs' are available, or how to get more mainstream administration to be able to increase the effective size of your empire...nothing is apparent any longer with how the 'game' functions and how best to 'exploit' any one of the myriad things you need to have in order to be successful. The in-game advisor gives a few sentences detailing what administration is, but never says how building administration buildings impact it, how to increase it overall, or...anything necessary to actually functionally PLAY the game at a high level. And so you're back to watching tutorials - fifteen minutes on every aspect of the game, until you're watching more tutorials than playing. 

Paradox. Stop doing this. Stop over complicating every single facet of every single game you create so that the player is so tied down in the minutia and tedium of micromanagement that the actual 'grand strategy' of the game is lost and completely bogged down by forcing the player to 'pay attention' to any of a dozen 'new' aspects of a game that weren't necessary. The original Stellaris was a great game - Stellaris as of 3.0 is a smorgasbord of interconnecting factors that each need to be micromanaged to be a successful empire, a dozen times over. It isn't fun. It is tedious. It is boring."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"I've really tried to like this game. This game is a fantastic 4X space exploration game with near infinite replayability...in theory when everything is working right. I have not played a single game that wasn't completely ruined by game breaking bugs. It is so disappointing to put so many hours into creating your interstellar civilization and expanding across the galaxy, only to have it destroyed by bugged event chains, bugged AI, and/or bugged game mechanics. Additionally, in order to unlock achievements, you have to play in ironman mode, meaning no save files and permadeath (permaextinction?) for your civ. That would be a great way of raising the stakes if the game worked properly. However, when you are 20 hours into your game and all you have to show for it is one bugged save file you can load to watch all of your progress disappear it doesn't seem worth the investment of time an money. If you wanted you could play non-ironman games, and hopefully be able to reload your save files when some game breaking bs happens, but should you really have to do that? Is it so much to ask that the game you payed for actually works?

Here are a few of the bugs I have experienced in the last two games I have played:
-Infinitely spawning hostile fleets after clearing their corresponding event chain
-Invulnerable enemies
-AI Empires joining multiple Federations
-Joining a Federation and not being able to interact with it at all as enemy armadas destroy everything
-Garbage AI in all respects in all circumstances. Consistently trash. I mean really, really bad.

This game could be enjoyable, but I can't recommend it as it is now. I was excited to play it again after picking up a bunch of DLC on sale (the only way to buy DLC for this game BTW), but I quickly remembered why I put it down in the first place. I hope to be able to change my review after the plethora of bugs afflicting this game are addressed."

Let's wipe out any lifeform that seems to be a threat
We'll serve 'em up a genocide they never will forget

You see aliens can never be as good as humankind
A more delightful race than us you'll never ever find

Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"It's a very faithful successor to Theme Hospital and carries the same brilliant sense of humour, if you enjoyed Theme Hospital in any way you'll like this. In my opinion a few things could be more balanced (queue management takes a lot of time for example!) but overall it's a great game."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"Two Point Hospital isn't such a simulation game like the most others. In fact it's far away from showing the reality but that is what the game makes special and lovely!
It includes [u] a lot [/u] of sarcasm and humorism in general. The diseases/illnesses the patient have follow this line and are therefore more funny than anything of realistic. I mean we're speaking from illnesses like Cubism, Floppy Discs, Grey Anatomy, Jazz Hand, Premature Mummification, Cauliflower Ears, Flat-Packed etc...
And really, it makes so much fun to discover all these different diseases and everytime you experience something new you have to laugh because it's always connected with a funny anecdote.
And in general it has to be said that Two Point Hospital has such a lot of lovely details in it which makes the game only even more great. With that I mean for example the loudspeaker announcements- this woman is so funny with the little things she tells and you often have to smile about it, the same goes with the announcements trough the radio. And the stil of the graphic fits also perfectly!
And even if you only have the main game without any DLC, you can spend a lot of time in that game! I spent round about 100 hours only in the main game, because I had a lot of fun to collect all possible stars for every different hospital- it gets never boring!
I can also tell that the DLC are worth it too because there is also so many new things to discover, new diseases, new hospitals, new challenges, new landscapes etc... 

I don't say that often, but I have no negative aspect about that game, I'm just really happy with it!"
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,Awesome Hospital Simulation with fantastic animation and great voice overs. The price point is rather steep on this one so I strongly suggest purchasing while on sale. Enjoy
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,addictive like drug
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"It is pretty good.  I found it good enough to continue to purchase updates as they came out.  Each update added a new layer to the insanity of the game.  I would recommend it to anyone, just don't expect it to be a serious game."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"Very charming & fun, with intuitive gameplay, music & effects. 

Worth a Buy!"
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"Where to start!

Pros,

Theme hospital was one of the greatest games ever made, this just came along and matched it.
High amounts of content and hospitals, more than it looks when you first buy it.
Hilarious dialogue and treatments.
Awesome amount of freedom and control over what you do to a certain extent.
Perfect for anyone who has an OCD for micromanaging.
Graphically extremely relaxing and pleasing.
The best of British humour.

Cons,

Learning curve is brutal compared to the first game.
Micro controls can be frustrating.
An awful lot to remember in the later levels.
RNG based staff recruiting system which can be annoying and cause a few resets.
Some form of co-op mode would be awesome.

Not really much else to say, props to Sega for bringing back this perfection and actually not messing it up!"
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"Mechanically it works fine, but it just doesn't have the ""it"" factor that would keep me playing.  It seems like I just plop down a few rooms, hire a few guys, and click the fast forward button until something happens.  Who knows, maybe it gets better with all the DLC, though I doubt it, since I've heard all they add is new hospitals with new diseases.  Don't get me wrong, the graphics are cute, and I like the diseases themselves, it's all just a bit boring."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,Its just like working in a real hospital
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,A nice sequel from Theme Hospital. Now we're waiting for Theme Park sequel and we're good :)
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"This game make me calm too much, almost patience too...For many year, i'm fan of FPS and RPG now find this game help me know more about simulator and hospital...Great game <3 <3 <3."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"This is the best steam game ever, in my opion. Me and my brother share the same steam account and it gets frustrating, but this game always calms me down. You should try it!"
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,I have bought every single expansion pack what more of a review do you need

ไม่ได้ซึ้งเพราะ Content  หรือ เกมห่วยจนน้ำตาไหล เสียดายเงินนะครับ
แต่ตอนสร้าง โรงพยาบาล คิดถึงแฟนเก่าที่เป็นพยาบาล คัรับ แงงง
คิดถึงสมัยเรียน ที่เค้านั่งอ่านหนังสือทุกวันแล้วผมนั่งเล่นเกม + แวะคอยเติมน้ำ เติมขนม ซื้อข้าว
ตอนเค้าไป ward ก็รู้ว่าเค้าเหนื่อยมาก เลยเหมือนเห็นภาพในหัวตลอดว่าเค้าต้องทำอะไรบ้างตอนอยู่ ward

คิดว่าถ้าเค้าอยู่ตรงนี้ก็คงดี คงรู้ว่าใน Ward ในเกมคนไข้ต้องมีอะไรบ้าง 
คิดว่าคงได้นั่งเล่นด้วยกันตรงนี้แล้วครับ คงโดนบ่นยับๆๆๆ แบบนี้ไม่ได้นะ แบบนั้นสิ แบบนั้นสิ

Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"Very entertaining game, it brought back lots of  good childhood memories (Theme Hospital), but with a more user-friendly and up-to-date interface with new functions, interesting and often challenging tasks, I can only recommend."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,It's healthcare.
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,Theme Hospital :)
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,Liked Theme Hospital back then. This game is even better.
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"If you ever played Theme Hospital but now your computer specs are too high to play it - play this. It is all but a carbon copy. I loved it. The diseases are still fun, the operation is easy and I very much enjoyed playing it. I cannot wait to continue and love this game!"
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"Two Point Hospital offers an enjoyable amount of complexity, but makes it simple and approachable with a gentle learning curve, clear interface, and handy tools to see what is going wrong. Even in a fully developed hospital, placing rooms differently is not too much of a headache, which allows you to experiment with different layouts. You can always pause the game, take a good look around and modifiy you layout without having to restart the mission.

You can gain 3 stars in each mission. Only the first star is required to unlock the next mission, and you only have to understand the new element introduced by a mission to get this. You gain additional rooms and items in new missions, so if you ever have trouble getting the second or third star, you can continue the campaign and revisit the hospital later, with your new items and experience to get it done (Although its perfectly doable to gain all the stars with the equipment you got at the start of the mission - switching between the hospitals is not required).

The artstyle is easily readable. This is great for a management game like this, because you still see and understand what's going on, even when your hospital is filled with hundreds of patients with wacky illnesses.
The humour makes even the jokiest of joking dads blush. If you dislike the focus on wacky, punny diseases & treatments, Project Hospital might me a better fit for you.

You can spend a lot of time decorating your hospital, if you enjoy this. The option to create room templates and use them in all other missions is great. Now you can design the GP office, Cardiology and Ward of you dreams, and just resize them a little, if need be. There are plenty of decorations, benches, entertainment and food options, allowing you to give your different hospitals different styles. When you gain new decorative items, you can put them in your room template and use them from then on. Every GP office of mine now has this fancy cocktail-bar-hidden-in-a-globe from the Bigfoot DLC. My Doctors deserve a pick-me-up now and then!
If you don't want to spend too much time decorating, you can also copy&paste the same item to improve the decor."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"A lot of fun - often frustrating - but really amusing, and has plenty of revisit appeal."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,My favourite depression game. It gets me focusing and I truly can go hours with it
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,I'm loving every bit of this game as much as I loved playing Theme Hospital when I was younger. Definitely recommend if you're into sim games.
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,no lizard but ok
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"Great, funny and witty game that has given me entertainment for years."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"I guess that I'll recommend this game. It's a very weal recommendation though. I don't think there's a ton of creative freedom with this game, especially the building part. Also, the fact you can't really control how many patients you can take is pretty annoying. The reputation bar is broken, in this regard. It's like you get absolutely punished for doing well. Pricing doesn't seem to have any effect on this either. Looking back at this review, I'm surprised that I'm recommending it, as I seem to only have complaints."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,covid
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"If you were a fan of Theme Hospital, then you'll feel right at home."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"its a solid game much like the sims and it can draw you in well its not got a pay wall and it is a lot of content.
the game is super fun and i like how customizable it is. 
but i would say that some things are quite frustrating like moving objects is hard when editing a room to the point where youll design a room and by the end you have to delete it because say you need to move the door. it is also hard to get the doctors nurses etc to manage their breaks well and this ehds in some characters taking 2 weeks breaks while others energy is red i wish these things were a bit more managable that and the little characters constantly running away while you try to move them also some of the rooms do not need to be 3x3 which is the minimum with all their equipment in them it makes it annoying to try and fit every room you need into the hospital and some of the cool stuff you want to spend money on for the patients and break rooms."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"I keep trying to get addicted to this game like Theme Hospital. It just doesnt have enough as a base game, which then puts me off buying the add-ons. Why could they not have just made this game and added the free content to encourage great games instead of profit."

They could have focused more on optimizing their games.
I'm using a Ryzen 9 3900x
A Radeon RX 580 Pulse
And I have 16 gb of ram.
The game hits 60 FPS on medium settings but if there are more than 4000 guests in the park the fps drops down to 20-30FPS unbelievable...
I hope you guys are going to put more effort in optimizing Planet Coaster 2 or just be friendly and patch the game!
And also the game needs more flat rides if possible. There are a lot of rides that I'm missing.
One of my first games that I got from you guys (Frontier) was Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 
I spent thousands of hours in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and really enjoyed it as a kid. I love this company from the bottom of my heart but now I have to be honest and tell you I’m disappointed and sad that my girlfriend and I had to spend so much money on new computer parts to make the game run well on medium graphics."
Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,Overall i really like the game. However i don't recommend it to people using low end PC's (including myself) as the game will frequently crash in the middle of building something.
Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,It is very hard to understand the mechanics of the game in the beginning. But it is still a great game besides that.
Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,"train go boom
"
Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,"Very good graphics and excellent for sandbox mode building but if you're interested in the park management side of things, construction is painful and the management side of the game is not very deep. I wouldn't purchase this again, and am comfortable that the ancient Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 + expansions is an easier game to play (albeit without bells and whistles), and isn't as far behind in the management side as it should be compared to a game made 15 years later, and with half a dozen DLCs available."
Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,"This game isnt really what i was expecting or anticipating. there are no in-game tutorials, and from what i understand only the console version has those, meaning I have to go through youtube to watch a video while then trying to follow along to learn. Plus from what controls i did slowly learn how to use, placing things in a layout just felt very disorganized as some things want to snap in place, and/or require specific space to be placed without showing you what that required space actually is. 

The campaign mode itself is barely a campaign and is in my opinion just the same thing as their challenge mode. There is also no real progression to the game either as you are just plopped in with access to everything making the learning curve just ridiculously steep. I was hoping this was going to be similar to the old Roller coaster tycoon games as that's how its advertised and compared online but it really failed to meet that expectation to me."
Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,"The internet requirement, here in 2021, is silly. Trying to play this game again brings up  a constant connecting... issue in the lower left of the menu screen. I cannot click any where to remove this ability. Even trying to Alt-F4 out of the game, mouse button clicks don't register, and I'm forced to Task Manager kill the silly thing. Unfortunate, since the first time I played this, I enjoyed it. But now.. I just can't recommend it."
Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,A huge learning curve but a lot of fun with hours and hours of content.

Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,No tutorial. :/
Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,"This game does everything right BUT be a fun management simulator

If your the creative, sandbox player this game is totally for you. If your looking for a Park Management Simulator go back to Roller Coaster Tycoon 1, 2 or 3. (Fun fact: RCT3 was made by the same devs that made Planet Coaster here) Hell even RCT:World has better management mechanics (and Its really funny how Planet Coaster and RCT:World are polar opposites)

But really im gonna point you in the direction of Parkitect, play THIS if you want the management game you have been dying for since RCT3

The problem really is I can't do a single freaking campaign without my profit tanking, causing me to restart even the beginner levels over, and over, and over again. I so much as place a f****** burger stall down, my profit goes from +1K per month to negative freaking infinity basically. You start off with a literal joke amount of money, 3 to 15k depending on the scenario. Theme Parks like this are multi-hundred-million dollar business 

And its sucks because i love the feel of the game and how smooth creating stuff is. For me personally i cant just jump into an empty plot of land and make something from it. I need a starting point and i get joy from taking Crap and turning into Awesome. Planet Coaster just does not have this and I cant imagine its ever going to be changed cause this game came out 6 FREAKING YEARS AGO and as I'm writing this I've also learned the developers have clearly done nothing cause the official subreddit has a lot of people complaining about this and it hasn't changed. Period. So yeah... i don't see it getting changed. Despite the simple solution is giving people at least 50k per scenario.

you can more/less do this yourself thanks to the Scenario editor just straight up give yourself more cash and keep the objectives but idk me personally it feels like cheating somehow

All in All: Great Sandbox, Horrible Park Simulator"
Goat Simulator,Simulation,265930,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,makes pp hard
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,a must-have vr game. very gud but your pc needs to be stronk
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"Great game, I can't wait for dungeons and the new home."
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"im a big fan of directional combat in medieval games, i will play even the most glitchy and euro-jank ones that i find for hundreds of hours, if a game has directional combat i will give it a go even if its anime styled, its my favorite thing in pc games.

i have been following the development of VR headsets since CCP games got in to it and developed for oculus(eve valkyre rip), its been awhile but i never had the urge to try it out, always seen it as a fad and tbh i dont think VR ever made that leap to become mainstream, it was too expensive and murky to invest a lot of money in, that was before quest 2 tho, now its cheap as hell but i digress, 

after i have seen a youtube video of blade and sorcery(thank you for the content baron), i decided that its time to grab a VR headset, i do not remember when was the last time i spent this much effort and money just to play 1 game spesifically, there are many other good games in the market but blade and sorcery is what got me in to vr,

the videos i watched on my flatscreen tv does not give it justice, i knew it was gonna be good but i never understood how amazing its gonna be, yeah the AI could use some work and there is some jank involved but i feel like i am now old enough to look past the shortcomings of games, there is room for improvement but for me personally it is everything i wanted the good old directional combat to become, the physics are amazing, fighting 5 npcs all at once is the best shit ever, there is this really good mod on nexus that adds a lot of medieval weapons, i really cant get enough of this game.

your mileage may vary but if you are a medieval era junkie like i am, this game offers some good stuff, if you are from mount and blade crowd i highly recommend blade and sorcery, this is all i can ask for from a game and looking at the roadmap i see how its gonna get better and better in time, its insane that 1 developer made this game, amazing work."
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"By far the greatest of its kind. No other vr game can compare when it comes to melee combat, and although the base game is severely lacking in its own content a very live and breathing modding community easily makes up for it. A must own for any needlessly violent vr gamers. 8/10"
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,best combat simulation VR experience period.
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,Play on my Oculus Quest 2 with the wireless beta through Virtual Desktop. Works pretty great. Loving this game. And its got me spending hours of my gaming time up and moving around.
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,I'm not a psychopath you are!
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,was expecting to lag and never play this game again like bloodtrail but this was the best 7 gb and 3 hours ive ever had (my feet hurt)
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,HAD SEX WITH MY GIRLFRIEND IN GAME
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"Welcome to Psychopath Simulator. 
Ever wanted to know if a demented, bloodthirsty psycho is slumbering inside you? 
Have you ever wondered if you like stabbing people with daggers?  
Or maybe whacking them with giant axes? 
What about bashing someone's head in with a wooden stick while throttling them with the other hand? 
Or maybe you are a more simple type of person who likes to see people burn while you use them as living shields?

Well look no further, dear Ladies and Gentlemen. Blade and Sorcery has the answers for you. 

This profound, scientifically sound and 100% accurate Psychopatch Simulator knows the answer. 
And the answer is: YES. Yes, you are a mad bloodthirsty maniac. You are completely insane and a merciless killer. 

Should that worry you? No, not at all. Your great great, great, great, great, great grandfather Eric Svenson would be very proud of you. So go get this game, become a butchering maniac and make Eric proud in Valhalla. Just do it."
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"VERY fun. If you like feeling like Medieval John Wick, give this a try. The physics are definitely on point and the mod community is extraordinary. Amazing. 100/10."

Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"Best first person melee combat ever. It's ultimately just a showcase game, but a very fun one. It has physics glitches and it's a bit too easy to drop items as a result, also it has a game breaking bug in which the cursor disappears and it's prone to frame rate issues and bugs if resuming after the headset goes to sleep, but regardless this game is hard to put down."
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,Stabby Stabby Stabby
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,This game brings out the worst in me. I love it.
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,i just killed 91 people
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"Super fun game where you can brutally kill enemies. It has a slow-motion ability, and 3 spells (fire, lightning, and Telekinesis). You can throw weapons, grab enemies  by their head, neck, arms, ankles, etc and throw them either with your hand or your telekinesis. There are swords, shields, bows, spears, hammers, maces, etc and you can even mod in more weapons light lightsabers or guns. The maps are small but well done, and just big enough. I wish there was a way to customize your own Wave scenario like a slider system for each enemy type or the max amount you fight at once can be, instead of using just the presets. Very fun game. I hope they add more activities soon."
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,its a good game thats all
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"I tried to play this game through the oculus link on my Oculus quest 2. I had a popup taking up about 1/4 of the bottom of my screen constantly telling me to calibrate my height by pulling the triggers. This wouldn't work or go away no matter what i did. Looked online and tried everything. Restarted the game, my laptop, reinstalled the game, verified file integrity, and even did what was suggested to fix this specific issue, going into the files and making sure under height that callibrated = true which it already was. A real shame so i returned the game. Really dissapointed as i wanted to play the game desperately and try out all the mods but it's very frustrating having the giant popup on the bottom of my screen blocking what i see."
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,THE BEST VR GAME EVER!! NO QUESTIONS ASKED. AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT... YOU CAN ADD MODS! My suggested website for mods is nexxusmods. You will need the vortex app if u want mods though.
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,Very good game.
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,committing crime has never felt better especially with all the great mods for this game
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,I'm going clinically insane.
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,hell yeah batman
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"Trust me: If you have a VR set, you want to play this.
Also check out the great modding community, you can also be a lightsaber fighting jedi in the star wars universe ;)"
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"it it VERY good, but the only thing is that it makes u a psychopath but u feel SICK like u can use telikenises with fire daggers and just slice people stabby people and throw it it SO FUN would recommend it 10/10 worth the price"
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,i have committed countless war crimes and plan to commit more.
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"Easily one of the best VR experiences you can have if you are into this sort of thing. Having played many VR games now I can say Blade & Sorcery feels the best overall and plays very 'smoothly'.

The melee combat feels the best out of any game I've played thus far, you could argue that physics for some 1h and 2h weapons could be improved but there are options to tweak much of that to your liking. Weapons physics are still a hard thing to master in VR, as there is a disconnect between the weight you should be feeling as you are swinging around heavy weapons in the game.

The inverse kinematics are pretty well done if not some of the best currently, I really enjoy this as it helps to immerse yourself in the game. Even with just a headset and controllers the body moves fairly well with your movements even while climbing. Some games have issues with just basic hand and arm movements and basic collision but combat always feels very smooth and fluid in this game. You do see occasional collision jankiness like in any physics sandbox but compared to any other VR game I've played it's barely of concern.

The mod support is ever growing and seemingly limitless, from star wars mods, gun mods, maps, weapons, enemies, game play changes, etc you can really mod everything (Think Bethesda mod support). The devs have shown that they support the modding community and plan to keep supporting modding efforts which is great to see.

As it stands currently the game is a sandbox fighting simulator, a dungeon mode is planned which will be a great addition to this game. The AI is competent but lifeless, the vanilla attack animations are a bit cheesy and telegraphic but there are plans to overhaul it in future updates, and mods can now add in their own custom enemies, animations, voices, and models!

If you like HEMA style fighting or are interested in any of the mods that are available (Outer Rim) I would highly recommend this game, just know that it is mostly a sandbox as it currently exists.

If I had to give a negative it would be that this game as spoiled me for VR games in general, no other game matches the feel of Blade & Sorcery when fighting, and the overall quality of whats in the game is well done.

It would be amazing to see a full featured RPG like Skyrim done with Blade & Sorcery, it would easily be one of the greatest VR experiences."

Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"sword go bonk
"
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"This is definitely the most PC-Intense (mainly CPU-heavy) VR Game that I own - an I7 6700K and a 1050Ti definitely leave a bit to be desired for VR though so it's not a complaint as much as a warning to anyone else treading the line between VR Ready and not. The physics here are insane, and the combat is incredibly satisfying. The simulation of weight is something that takes a bit of effort to get used to but it's nothing too out-there (just slow down a bit if you're moving faster IRL than in game lol) and it's the reason for all the swordplay feeling so right. There aren't a massive quantity of weapons like you might hope for from a game like this, but modding the game definitely solves that (look up ""medieval megapack"" first, it adds a ton of old-school weapons befitting of the game, I still haven't checked out every weapon lol). Also, it's only $20, which is definitely a bargain for something like this - I could've paid $40 and I still would've been well-satisfied."
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"I have committed war crimes the likes no one has seen with my magical abilities, would recommend 11/10"

Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,The best game EVER in VR when your bored
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"Between the devs and the modding community, this game needs all the positive reviews it can get. It's amazing. It's also basically part of my workout routine.

My only wish is that they would add multiplayer down the road. VR multiplayer lightsaber/sword duels? That would make this game perfect. VR is certainly the future."
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,Game will always be near and dear to my heart because of its wonderful jank.

Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"Worth: $20.00
Price Paid: $20.00

Bottom Line: What we would like VR combat to be in an actual full-featured AAA title. Why isn't anyone sourcing out for this developer?"
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"This game might be unsurprisingly a good outlet to release some negative emotion, but my real review here relies on the modding scene for it.
This game has such an amazing modding community, with people releasing mods literally every day. Be it maps, weapons, even custom avatars and NPCs, there's usually a mod for it. The mods push this game from a 7/10 VR experience to a 9/10. There's even one particular mod I enjoy that puts you in a massive dungeon map, giving you actual waves and areas to explore. 

good game, and as another reviewer so eloquently put it: ""fun when kill people""

The Outer Rim is absolutely necessary, btw."

Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"If you have the hardware, this is fantastic.

If you don't have the hardware, take your negative rating and go fuck yourself."
Unheard,Simulation,942970,"One of the best detective puzzle games atm. Unique mechanics and clean UI, very fitting thematic elements. Most importantly, the puzzles focus on piecing information together using inference, rather than on clicking mindlessly in essentially object finding games that present themselves as 'detective' games. Loved the characters, esp. the Truman show reference. The ambiguous ending of the main game wasn't forced or meaningless. Short but impactful. 

The DLC is a brilliant piece of detective gaming, and it essentially doubles the game time free of charge."
Unheard,Simulation,942970,Delightful mystery game that doesn't spell things out for you and really lets you solve things at your own pace. Awful final case and ending though. Killed almost all my enjoyment. I'd say skip the last case and enjoy the rest of the game as it is.
Unheard,Simulation,942970,"[h1]Good experimental detective game[/h1]

Similarly to ""Her Story"", Unheard is an experimental game that revolves around a simple idea and sheds light on what can be done with it. 

In this game you are given a bird's eye map of a crime scene and a time bar. You can navigate both of them freely. Your character, that is practically a ghost, functions merely as a way to determine what you can hear based on its position. The ""actors"" on the scene are blank circles whose identity you have to determine by pairing them with a name. Your objective is to answer some questions, and in order to do that you are required to understand correctly what happened on the scene.

While i could be happy just with the moment to moment gameplay, all the cases are tied by a final plot twist that gives an additional layer if you happen to be interested in it. My only gripe with this game is that in some cases i could not give some of the answers correctly due to some ambiguity even if i understood correctly the events.

Definitely recommended at full price to anyone interested in detective, puzzle, experimental or no-handholding games."
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,Good game. Brutal learning curve though.
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"While im a veteran of this game, with many hours invested, at this current time it is not recommended to buy this game. Paid dlc's each update, where for the most part the said update is behind a paywall. Game is at it's late stage, not much else they can do with the terrible game engine, not much I can do in terms of creativity, wait for Starbase or something, where the dev team seems to be making a game with more potential in it than this cash hoarder of a game. the ""Sim Speed"" has been this game's greatest shot in the knee, with no real unlimited possibility for creativity, as the game will hold you down if you try anything massive. Modded servers have extended my will to play this game but it all has but run dry. Virtually all servers have limitations on what you can make due to the game's crudeness, and with the game being 7+ years old, definitely is coughing up blood trying to stay alive. Doesn't help the CEO never took this game as seriously as he/she should have, this game may have been one of the greatest space game's to get into, but its lingering issues that started all the way back in it's infancy never have gone away fully. Emptiness is very present on this game, and I never have been able to get my friends into it because there is ""nothing"" to do. While this leads to a ideal sandbox, it is very unappealing for those who need at least some sort of direction getting into the game, it took me about 200 hours into the game to finally start getting the idea on what to do/what i can do, and that is a deterrent for new comers if anything, no direction, void of life unless you put way too much effort into the game to find worth in this sandbox.... Im personally gonna be switching to Starbase as that seems more capable of handling more in the game engine than this, and im willing to deal with the issues THAT game will come across if it means having more players around me."
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"Although I have 3000 plus hours in this game, i have now come to a point where i can not recommend it to anyone anymore. At least not when you plan to play survival mode. The time it takes to grind and build stuff. The time it takes to get anywhere in the universe is so much. And then half your ship gets destroyed by one of the zillion bugs in the game (which Keen just ignores and refuses to fix), before you can even do with the ship what it was meant for. That is just frustrating and I have had enough of it. You are better of getting together with your buddies in real life and just have a beer."
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"Too much fun. Years later, I still build 3x times/wk."
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,Bar far still one of my favorite games even after 7 years
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"I currently have more than 3000 hours in game. 
But this is not couse this game is excellent - it is couse I have excellent friends and we game as team.

Regarding solo game, it works flawless. At least I hope so - as I was gaming solo several years ago ;)
Game provides:
-Unlimited creativity
-Sandbox survival 
problem is with sandbox survival; YOU ARE ALONE, not only in this current spot - YOU ARE ALONE IN SPACE!

BAD:
Sun is orbiting all system. So, you can't so you can’t orient yourself towards the sun.

There is no AI, except Programmable blocks what are used as enemy AI.
I will not mention Wolves an spiders - as this is really bad programmed AI.

Problem is when you game on server: 
It is horrible. Every time KEEN make update, their update kills all online servers.
Online gaming is horrible - it lags so much and you can't build blocks;

On advertised videos, KEEN provided us with loads of nice rovers, but WHEELS lags online server and they they jump around, for no reason at all - which is best seen while the grid (rover) is motionless. Sometimes so badly as they succeed to damage grid on which the wheels are attached.
The same thing is with pistons and other “moving” blocks.

The worst thing in the game is the horribly made autopilot. Yes, there are various options in the ""Remote Control"" block, but the option to avoid a collision DOES NOT WORK AS IT SHOULD.

And in the end, KEEN continues to ignore the demands of us players to fix the shortcomings we have noticed so far, while selling stupid DLC add-ons with mostly unnecessary blocks.

The worst update is this last one; warfare, which killed gameplay. What should this update turn Space Engineers into Call of Duty?

I am deeply disappointed.
I still play only because of the team, but as the team started to split up we will move on to another game that I believe is better than this one."
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"Great concept, but it currently has a lot of problems. Considering how long ago it released, I don't think any of them are going to be fixed.

Very janky game, deaths happen nearly at random, everything takes too long, controls of ships and cars are very weird and sometimes just seemingly don't work, ores despawn if you mine too fast, bodies despawn in like five minutes which can be very frustrating if you died because you flew into a wall with your jetpack at 10 meters per second, etc etc. I'm going to stick to modded minecraft instead. It's a lot more stable, gives a better experience, has better developers (generally) and has more frequent and functional updates that actually fix problems with the mods."
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"Really fun game and dramatically improved by the addition of random AI to fight. The devs definitely lean in to the more creative side of this game but I hope they shift focus to work on the combat and network stability because it is so much fun to split a ship in half with machine-gun fire and then salvage the wreck.

Good adds for big fun time:
- better netcode
- hostile creatures of some kind to fight on foot and random space derelicts to find them in
- more encounters beyond pirates and ships in general (especially focusing on on-foot stuff since they've really fixed up FPS side of things)
- more weapons to use on foot"
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"Avoid. This game has been pushed FAR beyond its engine's and design's capabilities. My ships constantly despawn, stealing hours of my meticulous work. The systems are obtuse and inaccessable and most egregiously, the max speed for ANY vehicle is 100m/s, even in space. Which means just leaving a planet's orbit takes a minimum or 5 minutes, let alone flying to other planets, which can take over an hour. This is as the dev intended and cannot be changed without mods, which will crash the game. 

Honestly, This game has infuriated me at every turn, the worst part being that when it works it is really fun. Unfortunetly it only works 20% of the time. Avoid."
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"Removing Uranium and Platinum from planets and moons is just a dick move. like really what the fuck, especially when we live on a planet that has Uranium and Platinum inside it IN REAL LIFE.
Also, 5 hours of heading from one asteroid to another and I've found a shit-ton of cobalt and some nickel, feels like they also really fucked the ore spawns"
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"In the past I would've gave this game a massive thumbs up, but their recent DLC policies are getting worse and worse. It's gone from being cosmetics to outright in-game content that gives you an edge."
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,The good among us
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,Currently during this message i have 2700 hours in the game and its a blast tho its developers spend its profits on a castle rather than perfecting the game its a great chance to explore and create. This is a great game for those who have a imagination.
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,This takes base building to a whole new level! One of the best survival/basebuilding/management/automation games ive played.
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"Good, relaxing game if you need some time to chill"
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,mmmm
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"i made a car, crashed said car and then went to question life and why i spent 2 hours making a car."
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,Garbage game full of bugs and basic things don't function. Would not reccomend.
Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"I have really enjoyed all the hours and years of playing this game while waiting for content that never came and have come to the point where I'm sick of waiting. I rarely write reviews but I want this game to improve and hope that this gets my point across and maybe for others who agree with me as well.

Here's a pros and cons list of my experience playing this game for 500+ hours, maybe it's not as much as many other people have but I think it's safe to say that I've seen a lot of what this game has to offer.

[b] PROS [/b]
- Amazing sandbox
- Creativity in building is endless
- Scripting adds a lot of depth to what you can create in the game
- Dedicated community 
- An endless supply of mods
- I find performance to be pretty alright for the amount of things you can put into and do in a game like this

[b] CONS [/b]
- Collision/physics system is bad, clang is a nice meme but the reality is that it's ruining amazing building possibilities left right and center for years now
- The modding community is fixing and adding things to the game that the developers should make and/or fix themselves
- After your first couple hours in the game you stop unlocking new things in survival to create new things with so there's no real sense of progression after that besides creating your own engineering problems to overcome
- [b] The PvE content in this game is basically non existent [/b] and I'm gonna split this up in multiple points because it bothers me the most out of all
- There are rarely any hostile ships and stations spawning randomly in your world and they're not worth any of the trouble of repairing your ships/stations etc. The resources you gain from these fights are not worth your time at all.
- The real PvE scenarios (not counting the survive waves scenario) are really well made but very short and feel like only a teaser compared to the endless possibilities they have at their disposal 
- The wave survival scenario is fun once or twice at best and is a poor way of implementing PvE content
- NPCs are basically non existent besides the new ones they added with the economy update which also add VERY little content to the game
- [b] Exploration is meaningless. [/b] Besides wanting to build an even bigger ship to explore more meaningless places, there is no point to exploring at all. The only things you can discover are very rare crash sites on planets or in space both of which you have very little resources to gain from and thus no real reason to do something with. You can get it all faster and easier by mining/refining/constructing said resources yourself.

To sum it all up, my biggest problem with this game is the fact that there is nothing to do at all other than build ships in creative or make it a little bit harder by making them in survival instead. 

I think the developers should look at a game like Minecraft and see how they make you work for progression, which you don't HAVE to do, but you will surely gain a lot of things by doing so."

Space Engineers,Simulation,244850,"Do NOT buy this game if you don't intend to spend 100 dollers or more, on a game that ONLY makes its large updates payware (DLC) Small parts of the updates may come for free, but the big parts are to be expected to be payed for, which is so damn stupid, this game is far from finnished but if the standard game is so small, and you are forced to pay so much in DLC's then this game is just a cash grab for Keen Software. Overall the game IS good, in its design, but they make way to many DLC, stating that ""it will help with development"" which I don't think is really true. The game is overall great, but there is just too many DLC's, its like buying an unfinnish project, because when you buy it you only get 30 % of the actual game.

4/10 because of the 9 DLC's when writing this.

Feel free to hate on this review as much as you want, but it won't take the fact away that the game has waay to many DLC's and that it feels like a cash grab for Keen Software to make some more money on the game."
Steep™,Sports,460920,"Must play adventure sports game, Steep offers a unique experience thats very rare or non existent and basically very fun and even more with a friend. Since Riders Republic isn't going to come to steam, this is it and no brainer on a discount.

+ Beautiful visuals
+ Several adventure sports options
+ Controls and mechanics are easy to use, k/m and controller
+ Loads of content
+ Smooth build, lightweight, no bugs or glitches. Its been 5 years since release so yeah expected.
+ Very relaxing, turn up your music playlist and enjoy

- Always online, would cut out during unstable connectivity, but  can be played offline after
- Fixed dynamic camera, might be difficult to maneuver through trees in the toughest tracks
- When using a controller, the tricks are bound to the left stick, the same as movement. So when not careful, it will trigger a spin when you're just trying to turn on a jump. Very rage inducing on tough tracks."

Lethal League Blaze,Sports,553310,"If you liked LL1 you're sure to enjoy this installment in the series. Adds a number of new and interesting mechanics and 3 completely new playable characters + the full roster of the first game returns.

I cannot recommend this enough even If you didn't play LL1 I would compare this to games like rivals of aether or even Slap City as far as ""easy to get into, hard to master"" goes.

2.5d graphic style works really well for this game's aesthetic.

The soundtrack is most definitely another great selling point to this game. Not only does it include some returning favorites from the first game, but basically every track they added to this one is a certified banger.

I would definitely say its well worth the full price of $20 but if you were to get this game when it goes on sale (which is like Monthly/Bi-Monthly) discounted price for this is even more of a great deal"

The Thrill of the Fight - VR Boxing,Sports,494150,"By playing this game. The constant movement and swift punches with my arms allowed me to grow muscle mass.

See, I downloaded this game for my VR because i'd been getting bullied and despite my hopes not being high at all, I thought this game would be a good way to let off my steam. Boy was I surprised. After playing short playtime on this game (a mere 0.6 hours) my muscle mass and fighting ability instantly skyrocketed. The next day when I went to school, I greeted my bully like every other day except now I tower over him. Literally last week he was way huger than me. He was surprised to see me in such a state and I had eyes all over me. I took this as the perfect time to get my revenge and gave him a nice punch to the stomach, sending him flying backwards into the lockers. There was a long silence until everyone around me started clapping and cheering my name. All thanks to this game was I able to make this possible and now since then I have earned myself a hot girlfriend and the bully is now my student who has completely reformed and whom I give boxing lessons too. Thank you sealost interactive for making this game and saving my school life."

The Thrill of the Fight - VR Boxing,Sports,494150,This game is a workout. i feel like im fighting a real person. 1000000000% get this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Thrill of the Fight - VR Boxing,Sports,494150,"Here's the thing. I've played for a few hours and I keep playing every day. With that in mind I refuse to become one of those plebs who clock weeks of playtime and then rate the game a thumbs down. It's a solid game. It's a great workout - and most of the time it's a perfect boxing simulator. 

However, this game has recently dropped the ball on controller tracking. My hooks end up about 10 feet behind the opponent. My uppercuts consistently hit the opponent in the junk and my jabs have a habit of literally becoming locked behind the opponents gloves. I tried using the setting that ""reduces glove drift"" and this makes the game completely unplayable. You will literally have to bump noses with the opponent just to land a hook and it barely registers any force whatsoever.

I will say that it does help to just play in the beta version as that seems to have better calibration than the live version.

I would also have loved to have seen some sort of career mode, a W/L tracking system, customization options, and at least a few more fighters introduced but that's mainly cosmetic stuff. I knew the game would probably have have those features and I bought it anyway. No big deal there.

All-in-all, it's a good game. Incredible workout. I go 12 rounds before lifting weights. Feels good. If you're like me and aren't a fan of going to a gym but like to stay in shape - grab it, play it, love it."
The Thrill of the Fight - VR Boxing,Sports,494150,"I love boxing, it is hands down my favourite sport. And this here is what you expect from a boxing VR game! I'm using proper technique and combinations to defeat each opponent while scoring a great workout at the same time. My only criticism is that there is limited content and blocking in-game isn't as good as it could be. But that criticism is very nick picky as the rest of the mechanics come together so well! Like I said, using proper boxing techniques really pay off with how this game has been made.

I've been playing this one from early access and the developers have done an outstanding job. What blows me away more than anything is the price, $14.50AUD is a steal! If you love boxing IRL or want a solid work out, don't even think about it, just get it!"

Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"I finally upgraded to FM21 after skipping FM19 & 20 - mostly it was the xG feature that piqued my interest, but I also like to update every so often for little things like competition rule/qualification changes, refreshing rosters, etc. Coming from FM18, I've been pleasantly surprised at some of the new features added in FM21 - not only do I really enjoy the xG thing, I love the overall improvement in what I'd call ""realism"": The interaction with staff continues to get better and better, the way staff and management present you with reports and call meetings is awesome, and the scouting meetings before transfer windows are so damn cool. It all combines to make you feel like you're actually a manager and not just playing a game. I'm at around 230 hours of FM21 and I'm still constantly finding myself engaging with new things. 

Last, I'd just like to share my experience/thoughts on scum-saving. For the most part during my thousands of hours of FM over the years, I felt like I was pretty fair about reloading matches - I only tended to do it if I had a bad injury to a star I'd just signed, or conceded a BS glitch/bug goal, etc. Sometimes if I was having a bad day and fired up FM only to be down 4-0 to Man City in the 35th minute I'd just Ctl-Alt-Delete and replay the match a few days later. But with my new save in FM21, I've been experimenting with a strict no-save-scumming policy, and it's added a whole new compelling element to my gameplay. I had a real stinker of a game against Newcastle (5-0 I think) - the sort of game I'd have been tempted to reload in the past - and a day later my players refunded the supporters' tickets for the match. How cool is that!? I also got to within one bad result of getting sacked, and had to get something away at Sheffield Utd - what a nerve-racking match that was! My boys pulled out a 3-1 win to keep me alive, and we had a short run of good form to finish the season, allowing me to get the transfer reinforcements I desperately needed. 

So TL;DR: FM is hands down the best sports management sim on the market, I felt it was well worth the money to upgrade from FM18 to FM21, and if you've never experimented with a no-save-scum policy - give it a whirl. I think you'll find it rewarding."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,if u like crack then football manager is for u
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Football Manager 2021 hasn’t really rocked the boat in terms of enhancing the matchday gaming experience from last year. Games are as  difficult as ever to manage, and the minutiae of detail is just as overwhelming as always. Rather than a complete overhaul, there are numerous minor tweaks in Football Manager 2021, affecting tactical exploration and simulation. This time around, energy levels in particular seem to play a greater role, presumably to combat previously effective pressing tactics. In other words,  you can’t rely on your tried-and-tested methods from last year to get by.

Football Manager 2021‘s biggest change seems to come in the way that you, as a Manager, communicate. Gone are the meaningless emotions while addressing people; instead, your decisions are broken down into what really matters. While talking to players, the boardroom or press, you can respond in a much more clear way. You’ll be able to choose from responses that are positive, negative, convincing, or even backing down. Better yet, the intended meaning of everything you say is clearly laid out.

The communication overhaul really adds a lot to how you are judged as a manager in Football Manager 2021. Yes, results are still important, but you can really change the parameters of what your personal success is. If you aren’t doing especially well but are achieving the promises you have set out, you will be given more time.

This happened to me; in my first season of managing, I had slightly underachieved. But because I had delivered on my promise to repair the financial damage of the over bloated squad, I wasn’t kicked out at the end of the season where I might’ve been in previous instalments. The next season, having been able to gain control of the finances, I was able to cultivate success. This is a new experience for me in a Football Manager game; a series I’ve been playing for over a decade. While I may have improved the finances of a club before, I have never overtly communicated my goals to the boardroom and insisted on time to deliver.

Football Manager 2021 has done something that great managers do: it has acknowledged its weaknesses and improved upon them without completely rocking the boat. It still feels truly familiar as a Football Manager game, but the overhaul to expectations and communication makes for a more coherent and impactful experience. There’s more of a focus on what you say and do in your role as a manager and, over seasons, your performance is better judged. It makes a real difference to how the game can play out. The matchday experience may not be massively improved, but the improved focus elsewhere makes a real difference. For anyone who truly likes to get into the role of manager, Football Manager 2021 is a must."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Imagine playing Leeds on the final day of the season as Brighton manager. Your best player and top goalscorer is missing through injury. You must beat Leeds to win the league after an outstanding season. its 0-0 but then Leeds strike in the 67th minute to go 1-0 up. You begin your heart starting to break. But then out of nowhere, Lewis Dunk rises from a corner on the 79th minute to equalise. There's a glimmer of hope restored. Man Utd fans hear of your equaliser in their game and become anxious. The 90th minute arrives and its still 1-1. You can hear Man Utd's fans celebrating already. You have a freekick on the edge of the box though ..... MacAllister steps up. ITS IN!!!!! Its the last kick off the game!! The beer you have in your hand which was meant to drown your sorrows goes everywhere in celebration, including over your best suit which you was wearing because its such an iconic moment in Brighton FC's history!

This is what this game gives you. Moments like this!"
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Football manager 2021 is another great hit that again showcases as poor the Fifa games currently are.

This game provides a fair and balanced system which lets you do well if you know what your doing and are prepared for opposition but if you try and speed it: you get really something back for being bad.

I enjoy the ethic of always improving. I feel very immersed and determined to become a better manager. For example, I had a bad playoff season with Nashville in the MLS. I got so annoyed because we lost to a trash team so I berated the players and got rid of dead wood. I then signed top prospects and I'm now in the running of finishing 1st in the supporter's shield.

I love this game. It's hard at first but honestly give it a shot and once you have a good graspe of the game, you'll become Arsene Wenger's invincibles."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"It pains me to write this but after spending more than 400 hours I have to admit: it's a poorly designed game with artifical difficulty spikes designed to keep players engaged. You can be the by far best team in the league and you will always have a seasonal rival (undocumented in-game) which will keep the pace with you. You can be a heavy-weight in a small league and there will be a team which is not better than any other in competitions which will go with the same results as you. 

Worst part when the game decides that it should boost your real rival. I have just one example of it: playing in UPL with Shakhtar I managed to finish the season with 28 wins and 2 draws in the 30 games. Guess what was the gap with Dynamo Kiev? 2 points. The third place was like 20 points lower. A season before I lost the league to Vorskla - it had lost points in 4 games through the whole season and my only loss was to them. I had numerous finishings in previous seasons with different teams when on the last match day the leader was losing, my team coming second won and then the third team became the first on goal difference, winning 5-0 and scoring its last goal on the last minutes in injury time. I get that it happens in football, see Man City and Aguero, but not in the course of couple of seasons in a row.

Apart of that the game is addicting as ever although SI doesn't care for bug fixing (top managers have like perpetual contracts, in my 15 season save Simeone, Conte, OGS, Pochettino and Flick ALL were managing their starting cubs) and their UI designer clearly hates people - I can't find any reason to make the UI overloaded mess in dark purple color. In 2021 SI didn't even care to add additional skins leaving it to fans. Really, you become so lazy? You had to tweak a couple of lines of code to do that.

Match engine looks much better until you realize that it relies heavily on the patterns. If you get that patterns, you can exploit it, and if you want to keep it natural you will face artificial difficulty spikes. Maybe in 2000s it was the same, I don't know, it all felt like an unscripted free flow and now you can guess the outcome of episode 90% times the 3D field appears.

Tactics make no sense, as you can't play defensive football relying to soak the pressure - it's instantly punished by the opposition. Players with 5 in long shots suddenly pull of Roberto Carlos if you play defensive and there is no way to explain it but the match engine flaws. If the game decides that it's time to score, it will score. To play attacking you should do counter-intuitive things (deep defensive line and low pressure against the last team in a league is a must or you will be heavily beaten with the magic 30-meter screamers).

On top of that you have the SI community forums with extremely gatekeeping audience which is intolerable to any criticism of their game. Moderators delete negative comments claiming they welcome meaningful discussion and constructive criticism. Like, I'm a paying customer who gets banned for stating that I'm not that happy with what I've payed for. In all my years online I've never seen more toxic and hostile community - even Reddit is friendly and supportive in comparison. Think twice before sponsoring it. I was a big fan of FM in 2005 - 2012 editions, I haven't really played for 8 years and I had over 700 extremely frustrating and unrewarding hours in 2020/21 versions. I won't buy it before they fix the UI and fire their UI designer. I can't possibly recommend the game which is made with the goal to frustrate the players and encourage exploits."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"This game is like Schrödinger cat, sometimes you are happy, and other times you just punch your computer until you win."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"I bought this game yesterday, but 1 hour in FM is 5 hours in real life.

First FM game i've played, and i'm completely hooked. I used to play the occasional FIFA game from around 2002 till 2010, but the playing itself was always my least favourite part. Picking formations and securing transfers was always the stuff i sunk my teeth into the most, so FM is right up my alley. And that's only the tip of the iceberg, now i get to be in charge of training, youth intake, facilities, staff, press and more. 

Highly recommend if you enjoy the managing aspects of FIFA, which i can never go back to.

Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"There's ads in a game I paid 55 euro for, fuck off."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"FM 21 is definitely an upgrade over FM 20 and the rest of the series. The biggest would be the communication between the manager and the players along with other match engine upgrades.

If you're looking for a FM which would last you for 3 or 4 years until you buy the next edition which has upgraded features, look no further as this would be the one. You can always update the database as well.

Note: Gegenpress is too OP in this game and wins you most of the matches."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Just wow, I haven't played FM since 2016. And I'm genuinely Impressed by the on going improvements. It's an AAA class game for the genre I mean if you're into micromanagement it'll surely satisfy your expectations.  

Ronaldo is beyond broken tho. I had to reload the saved game twice in order to beat Portugal as France. He just scored a goal when we are tied like 1-1 on 90+. LoL. I guess I was lacking on in-game strategies. So I had to form from clean sheet. Then I found that a single style (called 4-3-3 DM wide/tiki-taka) it also works with a composition of wing press, that on every single match there is a really high percentage of win. 

Since then, I've became the number one with both France and PSG. 

I've made an offer for Messi but his fee was also enough to made me extremely uncomfortable. Barcelona demanded like 220m just for the fee. My budget was just about 10-40m. 

Tho I knew that the transfer section will be problematic so I've created a character named Falcon who is just 15 yo. and fully boosted. Can line up every single position except GK. Unfortunately that damn fella injured with a back pain when he tackles. He is my exit plan nowadays. 

I've totally liked the game. The only issue is that whenever I start to game, it leads a casual main menu but with a fucking tik-tok add on! it is the only bloody downside is for this gem. Just delete the fucking banner fam. I don't want to see anything related to that cursed app and platform. And seeing something like that in a manager game is such a controversial disappointment... Just saying. If you aren't triggered easily to see ads like these. Go ahead and buy the game without even thinking."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"It kills me to have to give this a thumbs down, as there have been so many excellent improvements in the 20 and 21 editions of this great game. But yet again one of the most basic, fundamental and important parts of the game are broken. I posted the same for FM20, and never had these isssues with any of the previous versions. In a nutshell: Goal was to finish in Euro Cup places, finished 6th. Lucky to survive the sack, a couple days later I've qualified for the Euro cup because Top 4 teams won the 2 domestic cups. SORT IT OUT!
EDIT - God it gets worse, I was sure my goal was a top half finish, and after the season review I saw that it was. So I finish 6th, get into Europe and almost get fired, when my goal was top half. SORT IT OUT!"
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"i almost refunded this, it has been out for months and you guys can't code for windows scaling??  its not a problem with any other game!  i have to adjust my pc's overall display settings due to this companies incompetence!??  you look for solutions and the official advice is clear your cache and verify the integrity of the files which have NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PROBLEM!  you charge how much every year for this and you're incapable of simple coding that even the smallest indie developer has no problem with??  no doubt many have refunded due to this blatant incompetence!

If you are having the mouse offset issue that so many do, you have to go into your display settings and set scaling to 100%, don't bother asking the developers they will tell you the garbage i stated earlier!

Shameful incompetence!"

Eleven Table Tennis,Sports,488310,"This game does one thing and does it well. The physics are realistic, the game is optimized and has many quality of life features. There is no trace of pay to win or any form of gambling."
Eleven Table Tennis,Sports,488310,"Great little table-tennis game, but it really needs a way to stop the serve-logic being quite so strict.  Don't play online unless you've perfected slice-serves because that's all anyone does and it's just chance who wins past that.  For a party game, it's great fun, and it ""feels"" right, but it'll take a newbie at least 5 games before they start seriously contending against even the ""Easy"" AI.

And it really needs a way to say ""NO WAIT"" before the computer serves at you.  But if you just want quick fun rallies of table tennis and you're not concerned about the score, it's very entertaining.

Silly thing to look at:  Stare at the paddle close up.  It's surprisingly realistic texturing."
Eleven Table Tennis,Sports,488310,"One of the best finds in VR, should be a staple in everyone's collection:

- I'm making all the same mistakes I do in real life.
- I know when I mishit even before the ball leaves the paddle, just like in real life.
- I ended up soaking my shirt in sweat, just like real life.
-I almost fell on my face when I tried to put my off hand out to catch myself on the table. Okay, that's not like real life.

PGA TOUR 2K21,Sports,1016120,"First off, the game engine seems solid. The physics of hitting a golf ball, the way in lands and rolls all seem spot on. The problem is the inconsistencies with the games swing timing and swing path. It's either too sensitive, or too shot dependent. The concept is good, just not implemented the best. 

PGA career is okay, except wildly unrealistic. You can be -10 through 9 holes and Justin Thomas will be right behind you at -9 somehow. If you shoot +5 then the leaders start losing strokes and will sit at like -5 and wait for you to catch up and then they start nailing eagles and birdies again. 

The game feels alive at times with the crowd, but at the same time so empty. You can't play rounds with AI golfers. A feature I very much miss with the old Tiger Woods PGA games. You can however play online matches against script modding hackers who you cannot beat which is cool. And that's about all I'll say about multiplayer.

The game does have some rewarding times. For me it's just playing a casual round at one of my favorite courses with nothing to lose or gain. Other than that, this game fails at being a proper golf simulation, even though it does well at simulating golf....Don't buy at full price."
PGA TOUR 2K21,Sports,1016120,"Played for free and decided to buy at $23.09 on sale for the deluxe edition. I couldn't pass up the price . Reading the reviews and being a long time 3 click player back to the old Links LS games then TWPGA and TWPGA Tour online . I stayed away from this shot method and posted I would never buy unless a 3 click option was available .So I give it a try and stepped outside the 3 click box .After making game adjustments and settings to my mouse its been very enjoyable to play. If your on the fence about buying do it you wont regret it. I'm on the PGA tour and going against the players I just watched on TV at 121st US Open. Its just that easy.

[i]Knockout City[/i] is a team-based, deathmatch, arena-like, competitive shooter that has a quite unique setting: It’s pretty much dodgeball but crazier!

[b]Gameplay[/b]

The Gameplay is pretty simple, I mean it’s pretty much dodgeball – you can pass to your team mates, you can throw balls normal, curved or from over your head & you can also throw your own team mates! There are normal and special balls in this game – each special ball has different advantages and they vary from sniper balls to bomb like balls. 

Before the start of a match, one out of five special balls will be randomly selected and will spawn multiple times on the map for players to pick & use. 

There are currently six maps in the game. Every map has their own flair to it which makes the game more enjoyable and invites people to have different strategies for every map.

[i]Knockout City[/i] offers a handful of different play modes, although Team KO ([i]which is pretty much team deathmatch[/i]) seems to be the most popular one. Their take on known play modes like kill confirmed ([i]mostly known from Call of Duty[/i]) is pretty decent as well. There is also a mode in which you have to use your team mates as balls.

The game also offers two ranked modes. The first one is basically Team KO and the second one is a 1vs1 match with no special balls. There is no indicator when you get targeted with a ball and a deadly zone shrinks the map over time in the 1vs1 ranked match.

[b]Personal Note[/b]

I think the idea of having a dodgeball shooter with some easy to pick up mechanics is pretty awesome! It’s also somewhat unique since there are no dodgeball games out there like this one. 

Throwing, dodging and catching the balls feel pretty good and satisfying. Passing the ball to team mates and using your mates as balls is pretty well made as well, especially the idea of having some sort of ultimate when you charge your throw long enough to make your team mate become a bomb.

In general, this game is very fun to play and it’s just super simple to pick up and learn. You don’t need to have friend to play with to enjoy the game but personally I’d recommend it because you get rewarded for playing with friends and / or crewmates. There were also some event quests that required you to play with friends – so I assume that in upcoming events it might be useful to have some friends to play with if you care about rewards. 

Speaking of rewards: You get a bunch of rewards for just playing the game. The rewards seem to be random but everyone should get the same rewards eventually. There is an in-game shop that offers cosmetics for the premium currency as well – which you can either buy with real money or with the premium currency that you get from playing as well.

[b]Rating[/b]
[list][b]Pros[/b]
[*] Easy to pick up and play
[*] Straight forward mechanics
[*] Simple game modes
[*] Short matches
[*] Lots of cool cosmetics that fit the vibe of the game
[*] Very catchy and good music
[*] Incredible announcer for pre- and in-game events
[*] Good graphic & sound design
[*] Interesting retro & futuristic aesthetics
[*] You can play for free for a certain amount of time / levels (1)
[/list]
[list][b]Cons[/b]
[*] The dodge mechanic can be spammed
[*] An Origin account is required to play the game (2)
[*] Some options won’t save after restarting the game (3)
[/list]

(1) The game offers you a trial version on steam that currently allows you to play for 25 levels before getting asked to purchase the game. You can find more information about this [url= https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1301210/view/3008947103106006903]here[/url]

(2) Since an Origin account is needed to play this game, some people might just skip on this game entirely – which is a shame. I personally don’t mind that I need to have an Origin account though.

(3) As of now (31.05.2021) there is a weird bug which resets certain options every time you restart the game. For me it’s the Depth of Field option and the mouse sensitivity. There are a lot of posts about this on the steam community tab so I hope this will be fixed soon.

[b]Conclusion[/b] 

Is [i]Knockout City[/i] worth to get? For me personally – yes! I’ve played the trial version for around 5 hours and I almost got hooked instantly to the game. If you have some friends to play with and if you like a deathmatch orientated multiplayer game which is easy to pick up, this might be something for you. The game is fun to play and its unique dodgeball-type of game makes its pretty special. I think casual and competitive players will have a lot of fun with this game.

If you are not sure if you like the game, you can try it out via the trial version.

[b]8.5 / 10[/b]

Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"Honestly this game took me by surprise. I had seen YouTubers and my friends play this game but wasn't sure if I'd like it. So, I downloaded the trial and within 24 hours I had reached the level cap and bought the full game.

Knockout City is packed with fun gameplay, emergent strategies, and all the character you can get. Not only is the game itself fun, and full of positive feedback loops, but every map, animation, item, and even DESCRIPTIONS have that little flair of humor, creativity and thought, a key sign proving that [i]real human beings[/i] truly love and have fun working on the game, putting a touch of their personality into every corner. Ill go over the main things I enjoy about the game.

[b]The Lore??[/b]
Yes, despite this game not having a story mode, you do learn a bit about the characters and the world they inhabit. ([i][b]if you seriously want to stay spoiler free then i blocked the next paragraph of lore or so[/b][/i])
[spoiler]You learn that a multimillionaire named Malcolm Magpie is initiating some sort of plan. In-game audio and map details describe him as a heartless corporate robot. He bought large sections of Knockout City trying to ""Re-vitalize the place"", and you can even see advertisements for (presumably) his shops floating around. One advertisement is even placed directly in front the same company's HQ. One map even takes place on one of his construction yards, and just below his magnificent podium you can find a school billboard with ""SAVE OUR SCHOOL"" still on it, crossed out with red spray paint.
 
You also learn that the announcer, ""The DJ"", is stationed on the moon, and he tells you a bunch of little tidbits of information. Like how the solar system has been colonized, that he lost his ""Cherry red guitar case with a bunch'a stickers on it"" at a train station (a playable map) years ago, and that his favorite restaurant is Galaxy Burger (also a map you can play on), and that he'd tip you double if you manage to deliver to the moon.[/spoiler]

[b]The Soundtrack[/b]
The music reminds me of 20's speakeasy's, up-beat bands with trumpets as the primary instrument. It's calming yet exciting at the same time. It never gets boring.

[b]The Sound DESIGN[/b]
God its perfect. You know when you've successfully hit someone because you get that awesome PVC ball [b][i]SMACK[/i][/b] sound. If things get quiet, you can listen for footsteps or charged up throws, if you get knocked out, your ragdoll will grunt each time they hit a surface. There's faint sounds of the surrounding city, and other misc sounds inside the map. Everything is spot on.

[b]The Gameplay[/b]
yes. First team-based game that has never made me feel like i'm weighing down my team. Everything that I do (except getting hit and dying) feels like I've contributed something.

[b]The Graphics[/b]
Very stylized and cartoony, I can't really put my finger on what the graphics specifically make me like them, but I do absolutely love the aesthetic of a 50's era hyper-futuristic city. For example, on the Galaxy Burger map, on the walls you can find signed portraits of presumably famous customers, and their designs are gorgeous despite being just a texture. ONLY thing I have a gripe with is how astonishingly ugly the female faces look. They look like apes at worst and a half-hearted transition at best

[b]The Monetization (yes)[/b]
They nailed this too. If you want to, you can purchase more ""Holobux"". the game's primary currency, but they provide you with a consistent flow of it just by playing the game and leveling up. You can buy cosmetics and animations with Holobux, again all of which have that flair of personality and quality. But even then, they also reward you with cosmetics for leveling up, and even XP boosts, so you can level up WHILE you're leveling up.

There's more I could get into, but I don't want to type out an essay...

TL;DR
buy it"

However...
Matchmaking system is awful. Too often paired with players much higher rank than you. A little irked that the game costs money to play and then there's an in-game store too. It's EA though so, expected.

I still recommend it and there are many hours of fun to be had but be aware that some games will be steamrolls due to the incompetent matchmaking."

Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]
A healthy dose of reflex-based competitive action that's easy to learn and fun to master, with a fantastic presentation, groovy soundtrack, and high replay value. If you have $20 to spare, spend it on this.

For a more detailed review, read on.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
Similar to reflex-based team arena games like For Honor, in that you have to react to your opponent, fake them out, or coordinate with your allies to score a winning shot. There are multiple ways to deal with your foes and any loss you endure never feels unfair or frustrating. Like, [i]ever.[/i] Win or lose, you always have a good time.

[h1]PRESENTATION[/h1]
Bright and colorful with a stylish UI. An energetic Jet Set Radio style commentator narrates every match. The soundtrack is every bit as groovy as you'd expect an urban-punk setting to provide.

[h1]VARIETY[/h1]
Right out the gate we have casual and ranked games with a variety of modes. Every map has a unique layout, some with environmental hazards. Each game has a randomized special ball that adds a little extra chaos and strategy. Outside of gameplay, the character and crew customization is fairly robust. There are plenty of items immediately available to you, with a lot more being obtainable via the in-game shop or from leveling up. You'll have no trouble creating characters and a crew that are entirely your own

[h1]MONETIZATION[/h1]
KO City is very respectful of your time and money; challenges are easy to complete and levels come at a steady pace. You get plenty of in-game moolah and loot just for playing. There is no premium currency either. In essence, you don't have to worry about spending a single cent, though the option is available if you so choose.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
Can't believe we live in a world where EA is publishing creative, fun, consumer friendly games. I won't call Knockout City the next big thing, but it doesn't need to be. It's just fun."
Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"Despite Steam saying I've only played the game for 2.5 hours, I've been playing a fair bit longer as I was on the 10-day free trial before choosing to buy the game.

Knockout City is an awesome, awesome game. The skill doesn't come in aim, but in the mind games and reaction times. Second to second moments where a snap decision determines whether you keep hitting players or wait for a respawn are basically every moment of the game. 

Balancing wise, I think the game is in a good place. Whether its one of the special balls, the base dodgeball, or the player ball, nothing feels cheap or unfair, especially since no ball is a one hit kill except of the player ball, which is extremely high risk, high reward, since the enemy can capture an enemy player in ball form and use it against the opposition or toss them off the map. 

Speaking of maps, map design is pretty solid. Plenty of well thought out spaces, each with a unique gimmick to keep things fresh. The current map pool is very diverse, each with a unique theme and a unique mechanic to play around. Hopefully the devs can continue this inspired map design for future additions.

Finally, mechanically speaking, its like a fighting game in a way. Timing is key, you can't cancel animations, so choosing the move to commit to in a situation is a skill that's absolutely crucial. For instance, you can only catch one ball at a time, so dodging might be a better option when you see more than one ball coming your way. That's defensive at least. Offensively, beyond the curve balls which are just SO satisfying to pull off, you can vary the speed of the ball you're throwing to throw people off. Slow balls at range are just as dangerous as fully charged balls.

Overall I highly recommend this game. It's awesome fun, easy to learn and hard to master, and a great time to have with friends, especially since each match only takes a few minutes to go through. Definitely pick this up, and hopefully the devs can keep things interesting, and who knows, I reckon with a bit more work it could be eSports ready.

TLDR Highly recommend."
Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"No other game like this exists out there right now. From all the CoD clones and Team Fortress clones, Knockout City is a breath of fresh air in the gaming market. It's insanely fun."
Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"An addicting game that I cannot stop playing.

Spend the 40 and you are already on your way to being Boujee xD
All they gotta do is have good updates with new content and bug fixes,
With a criteria of game they have come up with, i'm sure they can think up easy new maps and rotate in new ball types.
9/10
But That's just one man's opinion, you'll have to cop the FREE TRIAL."

-need to be able to forfeit a match and have it end *quickly* with no penalty other than a loss if one of your teammates is AFK
-backfill should be optional and rewarded in casual and should not be a thing at all in ranked

i have a great time playing this game winning or losing, unless i am losing due to AFK teammates or lag so these fixes would make the game excellent. will update recommendation once those problems are fixed. looking forward to where this game goes"

Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,Bad at dodge ball as a kid? Then this is the game for you. Best thing EA has released in years.
Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"Great game! Especially cool that it has cross-platform/play already from the start. 
It's easy to get in and fun but difficult to master. 

It would be nice if they would bring out an update though where you can see all your stats etc. Kills, passes, kd etc. etc. for yourself and for your crew."

its fun"

Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"This game is great, dont get me wrong the game is very fun and a new concept but there needs to be fixes to the game before they get my upvote. This game has a horrendous server issue, the entire time ive played this game there have been server issues. The main reason as to why there are server ""issues"" which i have found out today, is this simple thing: THEY DO NOT RESTRICT PING/REGION SO YOU PLAY AGAINST ANYONE. Comp in this game is a shit show you need a 3 stack or you lose (typically) but then the server issue comes in, and it no longer matters who or what youre playing on. I recently played a game where no matter what I did (catching the ball or dodge) i would still get hit by the ball, or when i would try to throw it and it wouldnt leave my hands. There is nothing you can do about people in shitty regions or people who play on literal kilobyte download speed, i had a constant 19 ping playing against these people in comp and nothing matters with the horrendous servers this game has. Its worse than rocket league servers and they ran on some shitty google third party that didnt work half the time. In my opinion this game needs a couple more mechanics maybe a curved lob or knuckle ball, and a couple more special balls that way sniper abusers and muliball users dont have the opportunity to abuse those balls as much and this game would be a little more fun, because honestly after you get the only 2 moves down this game gets pretty dull and faking is useless because if you dont see the red border its a waste and the red border is op in all honesty i think the ball indicator should be turned off in comp.
TLDR This is a very fun game to play with friends or alone, the only issue (which makes the game nearly impossible to play competitively) is the issue with servers."
Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,throw ball get hit by ball become ball 10/10
Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"I guess all the hours I put into the ""block party demo"" prior to buying don't show up; oh well for reference, while I'm no master, I got to level 33 or so, and gold in 1v1 ranked.  At first I loved this game, it was interesting, seemed to have fun mechanics, it felt fresh.  

After playing a bunch, especially ranked, I've come to realize 3 things: 
1) The gameplay revolved around who can abuse the walls the best.  By that I mean, it's possible to target your opponent from behind a barrier, or around a corner, and throw at them, while they can't target you; since you can curve the throw, it allows the you to throw the ball over/around a barrier at the opponent, while they can't even target you in return.
2) After you die, when you respawn you are shown where the opponent is, even in 1v1 ranked.  This, combined with the above point, make it easy for people to get a free throw in at you without you actually being able to see it coming.  ""But the target indicator when someone locks onto you"" you may say; yes there is a screen border when you're targeted, but the opponent can fully charge their throw, get close enough to the corner to get the target reticle  on you, and instantly let the throw go.  This means you get a throw at you with no prior indicator, and the opponent is still completely hidden from view.   In other words, a mechanic to punish the player who got a kill (you spawn with a ball in your hand, so you don't even need to go grab one like you might otherwise have to).
3) There are some issues with server lag.  Sometimes you'll be tackling to deflect a ball, but still get hit from the front, because the server didn't register your dash.  I've also had times where I tackle the opponent, but they don't get knocked back, and keep the ball; and even others when I have my catch animation up, but get hit by the ball.

If you want a game to play with your friends, or that could be a fun non-competitive game, this might be something to check out.  That being said I wouldn't recommend this for any serious play.  

Separating this from the rest of the review, since it's up to each individual whether they'd like this or not.  The game features a bunch of taunts.  Taunts are also spammable.  Putting 2 and 2 together, you can figure out that most of the playerbase will spam taunts anytime they so much as hit you, or dodge a throw; especially in ranked.  I haven't found a way to turn these off."

IF YOU ARE FROM THE OCEANIC REGION DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL IT IS FIXED."
Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"I sunk 13 hours into the trial before purchasing and I definitely can’t recommend the game enough. The gameplay is fast-paced, addicting, and really easy to pick up but hard to master. Think Rocket League style gameplay loop, Fortnite character models, all covered in goofy cosmetics that make you look like a neon Rockabilly. The game is incredibly fun and only made better with friends. Honestly, one good solo can carry but the teamwork often wins the match.

I am excited to get more hours under my belt for the upcoming season. However, I fear with the games already small player base, that it’s just going to be made smaller with the trial ending. Hopefully the game can go f2p to maintain the players it has so far, but this is EA we are talking about so I have my doubts..."
Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"A fun and fast game that is quick and easy to pick up the basics. Matchmaking does a really good job and putting you with players of your same skill. I've hardly ever seen teams get blown out, but it does happen occasionally. Very fun though."

Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"JUST GET THIS AND THANK ME LATER. FRIGGIN GREAT GAME

My god, what an absolutely incredible game. SUPER easy to pick up and learn, great set of rotating playlists for ranked and private matches, smart systems encouraging crewing up with shared benefits. This game is basically perfect. 

My only criticism, if I HAD to pick one, is I wish the ranked play was handled differently. Currently, It's all win/loss based, which favours grinding over time to inevitably advance (maybe more casual friendly? which is fine, considering the wide variety of players). I'd have preferred something that takes player stats and performance into account, like in Starcraft 2 laddering. That way, when qualifying, you can skip lower leagues and you wont end up with much higher skill players churning through lower level ones on the regular - they'd all just be put in their relevant leagues after they qualify.

If I'm being honest, I never thought I'd like this. It looks like everything I'd hate in a game, from the art to the tone and the competitive focus, but it absolutely won me over in every department.

Absolutely stellar game, you will NOT regret it."

I do not recommend this game if u are always solo. this game will piss u off with the matching making..."

Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"I've never had so much fun, while still being enraged the entire time."
Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"Knockout City has to be one of the most refreshing, unique and exciting multiplayer games I have played in recent memory. This game has incredible strategic depth and yet, does not feel like a massive weight of pressure in each match.

The maps, modes and power-up balls give every match a unique experience and though I am not a fan of both maps, they are massively different in their approach and their appeal. Similarly, power-up balls change  up the play-style defensively and offensively and you never truly feel outgunned should the enemy team have some on their side.

The one downside I have experienced is that, on occasion, you will be queued into a server that gives uncomfortable ping (~100) and I feel there should be a limitation of what is acceptable connections and servers for you to queue on.

I truly hope this game continues to grow, succeed and expand on their maps, modes, power-up balls and more as I have yet to enjoy a game as much as this one in years."

-cross-play and cross-progression right out of the gate!!!
-Try it out for free
-decent ranked system
-voice chat works
-20$ not bad for the price honestly
-soundtrack is amazing
Cons
-------
-Ui isnt amazing needs to be touched up in some areas like
(backing out of queue lobby after game to change skin or check shop or change mode)
-some crashes and getting stuck in loading screen 1 every 30 matches or so
-ranked system needs to be changed (right now you CANT de-rank out of your rank ex you can fall from plat 2 to 1 but not back to gold)

Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"Sometimes, having less features is the way to go. Games like Cyberpunk 2077 were doomed from the start.
This game proves that.

There is very little to this game. Find ball, throw ball, repeat. However, it ends up being one of the funnest games I've played in a hot minute. No instakill mechanics, no p2w, no lootboxes. It's just the best game of dodgeball you will ever play.

It's probably worth more than $20, and it has plenty of competitive potential. In fact, all it really needs is a league to host it.

Buy it, loser."

Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"If u sucked at dogeball in highschool

Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"This is exactly the bite-sized chunk game I was looking for. Great blend of squad-based FPS elements but with auto-aim for noobs like me, and twitch reflexes needed for catching. Looks like the cosmetics are gonna be super fun, and I like that you can actually earn the currency, if slowly. Can't stand games with a premium currency, especially paid ones. Nice alternative to Rocket League.

Maps are interesting and varied, as are the special balls that are random each match. Also, the built in game theory of throw or fake throw is very satisfying, as well as the choice of throwing a buddy for instant ko, but at risk of them being caught and thrown off a level, or turned on you as a one hit throw as well. The super throw turning your allies into a bomb is also super satisfying for both thrower and throwee.

Haven't seen any griefing yet, but it IS possible to throw a friend off a level, so we'll see how the ranking system handles that too. All in all, it is a VERY fun game. I'd predict this takes off, even though the price is a little high for a MTX game. Expect this to go FTP in a couple years, but it's probably worth getting now. Definitely, DEFINITELY fun, even if $20 is higher than I'd have expected. Probably worth it."

The game play is instantly addictive with tight, intuitive controls taught by excellent training tutorials. Each training round also introduces you to each map and ball type, allowing you to explore and gain an introductory experience with each before heading off into a real game. The art style is charming and fun. The character cosmetics and customization is a lot of fun, allowing for a lot of personality to shine through. The battle pass system and in-game shop is handled well, as is the first mid-season in-game event which does not demand your time. With the implementation of casual 3v3 as a permanent game mode, the Dev team has proven they are willing to listen to the community and react accordingly. With the ability to play the first 25 levels for free, there's no reason not to give this game a chance."

Fire Pro Wrestling World,Sports,564230,"I don't bury the lead- Greed is what kills this game. $$$

This game is pretty good. Far better than WWE2k. The issue becomes noticeable shortly after you get into it. The cost of the DLC is absolutely insane. To download and use wrestlers with the correct logos and gear- its going to cost you. For me, I just want people like Razor Ramon and Bret Hart to look like they are supposed to and just to have those two looking right, it would cost me $120. I am not willing to do this and therefor, I will always see this game as incomplete as every character looks off. 

This game is ok for $20 and pretending the downloaded wrestlers are sort of like who they represent but if you want to play what you see on youtube with all the correct looking wrestlers- not gonna happen without dumping cash. Enough cash to pay a light bill or buy groceries. 

Due to greed, I cannot recommend this game."
Pro Cycling Manager 2020,Sports,1178400,"So far out of my 3 saves two have gone wrong. First as  a procyclist in the third season the game just decided I would no longer enter races.

Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"I've been playing AMS2 now since it was first released in early access. And boy let me tell you this whole year has been a journey!
I'm racing in real life for over 14 years. And never have I experienced a sim that comes so incredibly close to the real thing than AMS2. For example: the rain conditions. SPOT ON! I've raced a lot in the wet. And I love it. When I drove in AMS2 for the first time in the rain. I was blown away how realistic this is.

After some time I started in some leagues. I've found great friends from everywhere in the world that are really great guys to race with. And of course at some point I created my own league. So yesterday was the release of the Racin' USA pack. What we got is revolutionary for simracing! We have 42 years of weather data from every day on every track. If I want to drive in rainy Hockenheim 2019, sure, nothing is going to stop me. I can even use the weather from Imola 1988 for example. That. Is. Mind. Blowing!

Now onto the physics. Many people don't liked them before the update. But they'll gonna like it now. You feel like you are really there in the sim. In the car and on the track.
The Youtubers that don't even have a go casually in AMS2 are so wrong. 

And now after the update a lot of online lobbys are there that are full with drivers. I've hosted multiple servers today and I had on each server max 28 drivers. AMS2 is a new Standart in sim racing. This is the future. This sim is done by a incredibly small team with a very limited budget. But look what it's become. It's become the best sim there ever was. And I've played them all!"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"Probably the greatest pretend race cars sim out there at the moment. Good tire model that really relies on a good setup rather than aiming to hit a certain pressure, good handling characteristics that rely on your ability to set up the car, great tuning options, lots of tracks, lots of cars. It handles well, and the rFuktor FFB addon is mandatory and fantastic. Probably the best feel I've gotten from any race sim.

I messed around with AMS2 when it first came out, and it felt uncomplete to me, kind of like it was missing a lot of stuff. I fiddled around with various cars at various tracks, particularly the BMW Procar at Suzuka. But it felt off, and I simply waited for the updates to settle down a bit. Then 1.2 came out recently so I got back into it. Imagine my surprise when I spent the next 6 hours fiddling around with the Procar and the 2020 Brazil Stock Car and had an absolute blast. The tweaking of parameters is so much more intuitive and responsive than in other games, and can make an awful beast turn into a docile and fast race car. I've had a lot of fun so far and I think the game is finally in a state to recommend.

The game is very setup-dependent. You NEED to tweak the cars a bit in order to get them just right and fun to drive. But it doesn't take long! Maybe 30 minutes of practice at most. There's a great series by Steelcast/Steelreserve on Youtube and it's also linked in the Guides section on Steam. Highly recommend that too.

Great game and sim. Heartily recommend especially since it's come such a long way in the last year. Support small devs!"

=====================================

There's really no game here.   It's a simulator."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"You MUST try this game. I cannot overstate this.. I'm starting with that, because I really think (if you came here to check it out), you won't be disappointed. You have nothing to lose. Give it a 2 hour try. You won't return it.
I know that there are many opinions about this game. I've heard about low numbers in multiplayer, the game is still in development, etc.. Sure, Reiza is still updating and improving this game. Bugs still exist.. fine.. 
But.. if you enjoy racing simulators, are tired of having to mod the heck out of AC just to get it to look like there is weather, if you want more than the same F1 20xx year after year, if you want a racing simulator that has just about every type of vehicle, from all different racing era's (1960s to modern), you owe it to yourself to give this a try.
The variety of race vehicles is mind boggling. And every vehicle has its own sound, its own feel. Try a kart similar to what you will find at your local kart racing track.. the sound of the 2 cycle engine, the incredibly frustrating time delay to get it up to speed, it is all very realistic.. 
Cars:
The Formula 1 cars, from the 1960s era, into the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and modern ... it is crazy.. These are NOT just vehicles painted to look like they belong in a particular era. They sound and feel like you are in a real Formula 1 car from that era. Each one is unique, from the impossible to control 60s lightweight cars, to the whining engines of the 70s, to the turbos of the 80s, and into the modern cars.. each era, and each car, has its own feel and sound. They did not copy / paste these.
The GT series cars.. I can't even begin to describe how good these are.. if you're into modern GT racing, you have everything, GT3, GT4, GTE, ... take the Corvette out for a spin.. you will not believe the sound... 
I have never driven a real race car, only sims.. but the feeling of one of these when turning a corner, pushing the limit of slip... it just feels right, 
The ""alternative"" cars... there is so much here.. just so much.. from the 1970s era stock cars such as Opala, Chevette, .. just really cool cars that were raced in real life on local tracks in Brazil and South America. This is a world those of us in North America and the rest of the world seem to have missed.. it is a very dedicated racing community down there.. and AMS2 represents it well.
The tracks.. every track is .. simply better than what you will see in any other sim.. there are many historical tracks, which (based on the scenery) really make you FEEL like you are back in time.. no safer barriers, sometimes no walls lol.. everything along the track looks like the era you are in... 
The weather... you MUST try this game if not only for the weather. Real weather updates, or make your own. The way the weather progresses, the way the water on the track affects your car, how this all looks... no way to describe it.. try it... 
There is no way to describe, the sun setting in the west, when the rain stops, and the track is still partially wet, but the glimmer and reflection on the small patches of water on the tracks.. and as day turns from day to late afternoon... the shadows... darker in some spots... sun on the horizon.. simply beautiful.
The AI..
In my opinion, the AI is some of the best out there. They will fight you for position, not just go to sleep, but will race you fair. If you have a position going into a turn, they will typically back off.. but they will continue to push you.. again.. again.. they don't just give up.. so you will have your hands full for an entire race.
You can pit and let your teammate take over.. he/she will drive until you want them to come back in. 
So.. I saved the bad parts for the end, but these should not prevent you from trying this game!
Multiplayer: Still a lower player count. You can find, at any time, about 25 to 50 players online.. perhaps 1 or 2 races which have 10 players.. these numbers are increasing weekly. (I am an offline player so I don't care about these things).
Championship bugs. They offer a custom championship mode for offline players like me. It still has bugs (refueling not allowed, points not assigned correctly), but Reiza has been phenomenal in there diligence to fix issues, so there is no doubt in my mind that these will be fixed.
If you want a game that you don't have to do ANY mods to make it work, give this a try."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"AMS 2 is phenomenal. I own basically every sim game you can think of, and this is still one of the best IMO. Is it 100% hardcore real? No. Its like 90% real in terms of physics. You'll notice that it's slightly easier to corner in this game compared to other sims, but it's negligible. Maybe I'll just do a list of pros and cons or something to make this an efficient review for others to go over. 

(A quick note. This is NOT PC2 just slightly changed and reskinned. AMS 2 is completely different except for a few UI things.)

Pros:

-Best FFB hands down. It just feels right in every single way!
-Best VR experience. It's just flawless and never stutters or skips.
-Best graphics. The sky! The sky when transitioning between day and night is unlike any other sim.
-Racing with friends. This is THE EASIEST game to setup a multiplayer room for you & your friends.
-UI. The UI is intuitive and easy to understand.
-Free content constantly added.
-Frequent updates (Debatable whether a pro or con)

Cons:

-The AI. JFC the AI are dumb. They will run right through you causing you to crash, hold you up, block you like crazy, etc. No other AI infuriates me as much as the AMS 2 AI. The AI makes me crash 10x more than any other sim I own. As a note, I play at 106 Skill and 50 Aggression atm.
-Still a lot of little annoying bugs that can ruin the experience at times.
-Still lacking customization, but that's a moot point.
-Some of the content you may want in a sim simply isn't here because its more Brazilian focused. There's a big BUT here though because new content that most other sims have is constantly being added (Look at GT3, GTE, and DPi to name a few)

Those are the pros and cons that I can come up with atm. Would I recommend this game? Yes! I recommend this sim to every single person that is into sim racing. Just buy it and see what I mean. This will remain one of my favorite sims for the next 10 years at least."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"The cars feel and look amazing, the tracks are incredible, it performs flawlessly (especially in VR), and it's constantly being updated - what more could you possibly want? 

The only things that could make this better for me is more LMP1 cars (an Audi R18 or Porsche 919 would literally make this 10/10 for me) and more lights at night (Nurburgring could do with some spectator activity like campfires and neon lights just to give it that appropriate feel).

Keep up the amazing work!"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"After the 1.2 update this game is now fantastic. 

Just extra work to the MP please, thanks."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,The sim that keeps getting better and better!
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,The latest update is amazing - great FF - great Vr performance.
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"I guess the driving is okay, never had the opportunity to drive a racecar so can't compare, is not an arcade game for sure.

Cars: incredible variety of machines, from karts to trucks, 80's/90's 100hp hatchbacks, tubs with wheels to actual F1, the now famous GT3, also GT4 and GT5, etc. 

Tracks: the same, from kart renting to 10 corner Brazilian club and to the Green hell, try new tracks you never driven before, they are so much fun!

Pretty well optimized, it has VR.
 
It's reasonably priced, what are you wanting for?"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,Great sim for people who love multiclass racing. It features motorsport classics like the Nordschleife as well as much niche content and histotic racing.
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"I've rarely seen a developer so dedicated to improving its product, and while I do have some qualms about the way it goes about improving its product, I will say that the progress made in a year since release has been impressive.

It's not there yet, not at all, but it has a lot going for it. First, it's gorgeous. It's literally the best-looking sim racing title I've ever played. 

Second, the physics, while not to everybody's taste, are a unique interpretation of reality. I'm not a real race car driver, so I can't comment on the realism, but some of these cars are an absolute joy to drive. 

There are still (June 2021) some major issues with this game, such as the bare bones multiplayer experience with no rankings, as well as just a general severe lack of polish (setups are a pain, pit stops are wonky, AI is inconsistent from track to track, the UI could use some major customisation, the number of liveries on some cars is very low and can't be expanded by creating more, some classes are a bit wonky to the neophyte (for example, unless you're a hardcore F1 historian, good luck parsing through the Formula Classic, which has the G1M1, G1M2, G2M1, G2M2, G2M3, G3M1, G3M2, G3M3... and then you have to figure out what's classic and what's retro (Retro G1 and Retro G2), or is it Formula Vintage (G1 or G2?) and how either of these differ from a vintage Formula V10 G1, Formula V10 G2, or Formula V12) - and telling the Formula Reiza and the Formula Ultimate apart is another can of worms). I know licensing is a thing, but it could just have been so much cleaner by just using years instead, calling cars ""Formula 1993 V12"" or what have you, rather than trying to figure out what the difference between the   Formula Classic G3M1 and the Formula V12 is. It's just not obvious.

The TL;DR: It's an incredibly raw game, to be sure, but it has amazing potential, and the sky's the limit for this title. I'm getting in on the ground floor, and I love it. If you want a more polished experience, perhaps wait a bit. It hasn't surpassed Assetto Corsa, the gold standard of sim racing, but it does offer superior graphics and far superior multiplayer settings. So, despite it being rather raw, I love racing with friends and bots."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"Launched it almost a year after purchase ans since last time I played. Changes a huge. Car feels very realistic (with a good wheel and in VR), With a good PC (not a top - R5, 16Gb, 5700XT) game is awesome!!!"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"It is definitely neither perfect, nor complete. But it is fun. I do like it overall more than other sims (despite Dirt..which is my favorite), because...

* Completely controllable with the wheel
* The UI is simple
* Nordschleife, Spa + Historicals
* Fun (though not 100% accurate simulated)
* The upcoming weather system (prediction for past 40 years including foliage change)

I am a casual sim racer, powering on sims (Dirt and AMS 2) like 2-3 times a week for about 30 minutes per session. Just hot lapping my favorite tracks. That's just it. For this kind of racers, it is just perfect :-)"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,It's now a challenger...
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"The best sim currently available in my oppinion. Plenty of tracks and cars without the need for dlc unlike other popular titles I won't mention. Great FFB feel. Very real with lots of capacity to personalise controls. Awesome graphics. Some occasional glitching depending on the latest update but then my graphics cards card is pretty basic. 
Awesome racing sim. Fully recommended."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"This is a racing game for the casual player that doesn't want to play an arcade game, which is were I think Project Cars 2 was. Overall, it is an entertaining game."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"Incredible sim and massive upgrade to PC2. Tracks are modeled perfectly, force feedback is excellent, physics feel just right and it looks great."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"Really awesome and immersive in vr, cars feel lively and tracks are beautiful."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,Update 1.2 did it. Automobilista 2 has now developed into the currently most fun racing sim to drive. Especially in VR. Great job Reiza.
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"Absolutely yes. I have been watching this game for a few months now. Actually, watched some of Jimmy Broadbent's videos on the 1st game, and a few on the 2nd. I asked the community how is the game, and got loads of responses. I eventually caved and got the game. 1st impressions are WOW. I own a low-end wheel (G29 is an alright wheel, but it's a starter one) and it feels amazing. Got some FFB files from people and it's even better. The game is BEAUTIFUL and i mean it. The weather system is top notice. makes them up there competing for the best sim. The AI I won't lie, has their moments. Sure, you can say that about other games but these AI are something else. Each update, they get better and better. Just had a race with the current build (After the DLC) and I'm really enjoying this sim. I got the season pass (I mean, 2 years of DLC paid for) and enjoying the extra content, right now it may seem (small) but what they have planned is what I'm excited for. Happy to support the devs any day, they update and push out Bug fixes like they WANT to be the best. One of the main reasons I got the sim. 100% recommend"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"This sim has come a long way in the last year.  If you're looking for a rock solid VR racing sim, there is no better.   The physics are good, the FFB is improving and the VR performance is rock solid.  I uninstalled ACC and replaced it with AMS2."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,This game is quickly becoming my favorite sim.  Spend the money and get all of it.  It's completely worth it.
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"One of my favourite sim racing games overall and definetly my prefered for playing in VR.  Loads of unique content nowhere to be seen anywhere else. More mainstream, big licenced content being added all the time through season pass that is quite expensive at the moment, but base game offers more than enough for me at the moment."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"This is a amazing game for a wheel. I've had multiple people who have zero sim racing experience jump on this game and after a couple of spins and instantly putting it in the wall, they start keeping it on the black stuff. Commenting on the feel coming through the wheel and having endless fun.

They end up getting sucked in and trying to send a lap picking up the throttle, brake and steering on my G29 and really enjoy the driving experience and getting completely sucked in and wanting to be better punching out lap after lap till they have to leave

Buy this game and have hours and hours of FUN!"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,GTE cars are amazing
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,Juts came back to sim racing and in VR. Honestly this game has come so far since I last played it. Genuinely blown away. Best VR racing sim currently available??
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"VR is simply stunning, and my current FFB setup with the T500 and bass shakers is the best I've experienced."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"Alot better handling than PCars2, 
Fantastic race sound in VR with Reverb G2.
AI is decent and will bump you like in RL"

Skater XL - The Ultimate Skateboarding Game,Sports,962730,do you like skateboarding? you're gonna LOVE this game
Skater XL - The Ultimate Skateboarding Game,Sports,962730,great game love it
Skater XL - The Ultimate Skateboarding Game,Sports,962730,"GREAT GAME, SHIT DEVS"
Skater XL - The Ultimate Skateboarding Game,Sports,962730,as a super good skater man who skates on a skate board i would recommend this skating game with a skate board cuz it is very realistic to the big very big skater things i do with a skate board in real life on a skate board.
Skater XL - The Ultimate Skateboarding Game,Sports,962730,good only with mods but when you do have them the game is incredible. pog
Skater XL - The Ultimate Skateboarding Game,Sports,962730,SKATE
Skater XL - The Ultimate Skateboarding Game,Sports,962730,"It disappoints me to say that I can no longer recommend this game. While this game does have some solid game mechanics, the developers have made some bizzare choices recently.

With very little in terms of challenges in this game, it is up to the players to make their own fun. That on its own is not a complaint but what is a complaint is the removal of features that made this game worthwhile given how little content is included.

I originally bought this game the very day it was release on PS4 and again after building my PC. I had my fun with it but ultimately got bored playing by myself after completing most of the challenges. The introduction of the multiplayer beta had me very excited. It brought new life to the game. Initially, multiplayer provided a reason to come back to it and recommend it to others. My friends and I had found a very fun flow to our skate sessions. We would all skate around independently in a map, working on our own lines for as long as it took for us to get it perfect. Once one of us nailed it, we would call out to the others to come watch the replay. [b]We all live in different places so the ability to see our friends doing a cool line in the game world while they were in a replay was incredible.[/b]

Not only did this make it so that we didn't all have to stand around bored waiting for someone to land something in real-time. It also allowed for amazing replay possibilities. One player could land their perfect line, and continuously replay it in the replay mode while the other players try to land their line at the same time. After the second or even third player landed their line the result would be a replay with everyone nailing their tricks back to back even if they didn't happen at the same time. This was the entire appeal of playing this game with friends for me and my group. It was awesome and I convinced several people to buy the game based on this feature alone.

One day we hoped online excited to skate around and to our disbelief the best feature of the game outside of the skateboarding was REMOVED. I can not for the life of me understand why the developers did this or who thought this was a good idea. It killed the game for us and I just haven't cared to go back to it since. There was a time where I did recommend this unique skateboarding game to people but I can't anymore simply because of the decisions made by Easy Day Studios. I would love for this feature to return as it would justify coming back to the game but until then, this game is dead to me.

[hr][/hr]

[b]Pros[/b]
- Decent graphics
- Variation to tricks based on input
- Solid basic trick animations
- Soundtrack fits skateboard culture well
- Community maps and content packs

[b]Cons[/b]
- Removal of gameplay features
- Tone deaf dev team with a community begging for new content (especially on consoles)
- Buggy environments with invisible walls when approaching obstacles from certain directions
- Inconsistent grindable surfaces. Several obstacles that should obviously be grindable are not throughout the map list
- Limited trick list.
      Fundamental tricks missing such as impossible, no comply, boneless
- No ability to get off board
- Very limited soundtrack

Skater XL - The Ultimate Skateboarding Game,Sports,962730,Half pipes are Sh** cant even do one and land it no matter what the game just doesn't let you.
Skater XL - The Ultimate Skateboarding Game,Sports,962730,not a good or evven great game skate has better physics than this game!!! they need to update the grinding and flipinhg so the board and person doesnt jump across the map like some crazy alien stuff 2 stars
Skater XL - The Ultimate Skateboarding Game,Sports,962730,"its a decent game. nollies aren't working for me like they should, they either pop immediately or not at all. i bought this game when it was $20 and they haven't fixed this glitch since release. wouldn't buy for current price"
Ultimate Fishing Simulator,Sports,468920,Could be a bit more intuitive but it is an excellent simulation.  I am 60 years old and fished most of my life both north and in the southern U.S.  This software provides an excellently realistic experience and makes me use everything I have learned through the years to be a successful fisherman.  I only wish I could keep some of the prizes for my skillet!!!
Ultimate Fishing Simulator,Sports,468920,"The fishing life
I've been playing approximately 55 hrs now about to reach lvl 14 anxiously awaiting for the accomplished ability to purchase live fish bait at the bait & tackle store, and I'm amazed at the devs' attention to every detail by providing dynamic scenery represented by the different cultural aspects of the gaming fishing locations such as the placid scenic & sensual beauty of Betty lake; the cold rocky appeal of Baikal Lake; the country of Greenland's provoking old traditional look of a small village overlooking a sea bordered by mountainous craggy rocks.
What really overwhelms me is the picturesque underwater fishing UI module that UF developed blowing my mind in excited anticipation as a big imposing fish slowly approaches -in -my-face to take my bait while playing on my PC.
What if the devs' incorporate dramatizations like movie film producers & directors do when presenting scenes like unexpected events occurring in the aquatic background while in the foreground you're doing your thing with your Console, Mobile or PC? For example a scene where a fish is taking another gamer's bait, or various garbage is falling in the water above, or a dead body legs and feet dangling held down by a heavy weight suddenly splashes in the lake?  That would be awesome."
Fishing Planet,Sports,380600,Fairly Decent game.
Session: Skateboarding Sim Game,Sports,861650,"    I have owned this game for a little while now, but I still just can't bring myself to play it for more than a couple hours at a time. It just doesn't feel good, sure the difficulty makes it rewarding to land a cool trick but the broken filming system immediately kills that feeling. It is now 2021 and Session is still WAY too unfinished to recommend to anyone.
    The game just looks eerie imo, I'm not sure what it is, the textures and everything are technically acceptable and realistic, but something about the lighting and look of the game feels like skating in gmod. Everything looks and feels dead.
    There is STILL almost no working transition or vert, landing in a bank is a complete gamble, maybe you'll roll out smooth maybe you'll stop in your tracks and fly off your board. Let alone tricking UP a ramp, chances are even lower that you'll pull that off. Same with a lot of the rails and grind physics, although admittedly this is much more consistent than trying to ride slopes. This ties in to the ugly look of the skating too; your skater just doesn't move their body in a super convincing way, especially when it comes to riding angled surfaces and landing difficult or unique tricks. It's robotic, kinda like the skate games kinda except it really doesn't fit here and even skate 1 looks better.

    The mod community is okay, there are some talented individuals trying their best to make this game fun but it's a bit like polishing a turd. If you want to feel the frustration of skating in real life trying the same one trick over and over, you could enjoy this game. But if you wanna put together sweet smooth lines and actually be stoked on how it looks, this game doesn't cut it to me. Even if you manage to pull one off, chances are you won't be able to record it anyway.
    Theres definitely something here but the game is just way too buggy right now. I know the skater xl comparison is a bit tired by now, and most of the good things about THAT game come from mods, but at least it works most of the time.
tl;dr
This game may be good one day, but judging by the current state it won't be anytime soon. If you can handle the buggy robotic style and value difficulty over flow, there is plenty of fun to be had, you just gotta force it.

Session: Skateboarding Sim Game,Sports,861650,"i really hate how this still feels like a tech demo after years since taking my money, dont care how ""real"" others make it out the physics is janky at the best of times."
Session: Skateboarding Sim Game,Sports,861650,"love this game so fucking much, please add map challenges =)"
Session: Skateboarding Sim Game,Sports,861650,Even though they are still updating often it is glitchy and akward player motions
Session: Skateboarding Sim Game,Sports,861650,"Session is the be all, end all of skateboarding simulators. 

Session is an unforgiving yet rewarding experience. You WANT to nail that trick in your head and you'll keep hitting the same spot till you get it right. The game is easy to learn, but hard to master. 

Session is made by a group of devs who care about what they have here, and more importantly their community. I can't wait to see what this game looks like on version 1.0. I've been playing it since it released on xbox early access and i loved it so much, I bought it again on PC. 

Do yourself a favor and buy it now. If you love skateboarding, session will come naturally to you."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"This is a unique air hockey inspired game. The gameplay is fun. The characters are amusing. It is apparent there is much replay value to this game.
The gameplay is great. Each opponent you face off against has a special shot they perform once powered up. The opponents you face in the beginning don't have very tricky shots but the shots of later opponents are very intense and hard to combat. You can play a variety of modes against each opponent. There is a simple duel mode in which you battle your opponent up to a certain amount of points. There is also a bet mode in which you can bet up to a set number of coins on the match. A survival mode is also available where one strike against you results in the game being over.
The unlock system adds complexity to the game. Mallets and pucks of varying abilities are able to be unlocked. In fact you can unlock the mallets your opponents use to unlock their shots. There is also a leveling system in which you unlock different coin boosts for the particular modes.
A couple minors gripes I have are the lack of multiplayer and some annoying quirks of the characters. When you score on characters they perform the same action upon every point you win against them. So their catchphrases can get old quickly. However, you can just play a different character upon getting too annoyed.
Overall this game surprised me with how fun it is and I feel I will be sinking many hours into it."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is a great animated 3D air hockey game.  The game is controlled via the computer’s mouse. You have to hit a hockey puck with the aim to knock the hockey puck past the opponent’s site (and to get the puck when the opponent knocks it to you). In Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe you have a modern, colorfull design, 13 opponents on 5 floors (with different looking rooms), more than 40 gadgets and equipment and and and. This game is perfect if you just want to play a bit alone. The game saves itself so you have nothing to do when you want to quit the game. You can level your own character (about 200 levels!) and there are over 350 missions and 120 mini quests you can do. If you really want to collect all achievements and to do all quests you can spend much time on that game. I would buy it always again."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"I used to play Shufflepuck Cafe on the Atari ST, back in the 1980's. This is a lovely recreation, with loads of new features to explain exactly why you're playing shufflepuck against a motley assortment of aliens and robots."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"An OK little game to remember the original game from the nineties with some flaws that cannot be overlooked.

Clearly designed originally as a free-to-play (an insame amount of challenges, in-game achievements requiring 50+ hours of gameplay and more than a thousand matches to win, different sort of currencies, XP, slot machine, etc...), these mechanisms only strenghten the impression of a lack of content.

Which is sad, because the grinding slowly kills a game that had good efforts put into it (there's decent writing, overall good controls, balanced AI). This should be a lesson to game designers: forcing the player to put more hours than he normally would have only makes him/her notice the little things that are wrong (repetitive sound design, aberrant mallet behaviour on some occasions, too many menus...).

If you are bent on 100%ing games, just don't buy this one, the time you will have to spend is not worth it. For the others who might enjoy a few arcade air hockey matches, you can spend a few bucks when the game is on sale."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"******UPDATED******
After more hours into the game and all floors unlocked I have to say the game becones unfair with ai using their powers as much as they like and to get any thing is a major grind. I am talking about Star Wars Force Collection grind, I would hate to see the f2p mobile version. Sadly I can not recommend due to those things.

Do you like pong? Do you like Star Wars? If you answered yes to both then this game is for you! Though not set in the Star Wars universe the universe you are in is very Star Warsy even down to the cantina music. It's got a cute charm to it. 

Before you dive into the trenches of this game be warned first, this was originally a phone game that was free to play with in app purchases. No no, there are no IAP here, you buy the game once and that's it, but you can tell because you have to grind and grind and grind to get anything. 

The graphics really surprised me knowing that this is a mobile game, though it could use a little AA, it's very pleasing to the eyes. The music is hit or miss after hours of grinding your better off playing your own. The matches are short and sweet lasting only a minute or so but they are fun. You can unlock different power ups and upgrade your paddles and puck slightly. The only thing missing from this game is online play, that would be a blast to play your buddy in a pong like game."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"This is a port of an iOS free-to-play-with-microtransactions game.  It seems that the only thing that has been changed is that the microtransactions have been removed.  I wanted to relive my Shufflepuck Cafe days, not have to grind for hours to get the different types of currency needed to buy upgrades and new levels.  The game looks and plays well enough, but it's so obviously a port of a microtransaction-laden game that I just can't recommend it until the devs cut out some of the ridiculous grinding."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Normally being a fan of more action-like games or even shooters, I am surprised of how much this game draws me in. The characters are interesting and way more multidimensional than characters in other games that are supposed to be ""main heroes"", the gameplay itself is fluid, fun, and there are a lot of things to earn and rewards to get that will keep you going.

I can't recommend this game enough and I am surprised how much I like it, given how it was a ""curiosity-buy"". I am not disappointed :)

Buy this."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Sufflepuck Cantina is a cute little casual game about air hockey simulation, ideal for playing in small doses. What it does it does perfectly with a smooth mouse response and clear and intuitive controls.

Long story short, you play as an astronaut stranded in a distant planet inhabited by a bunch of freaks obsessed with air hockey. In order to get them help you to fix your broken spaceship you need to make youself a name as an air jockey player and beat (a looot of times) the 13 opponents. You start with a basic mallet and puck and the 3 beginner opponents, and you must grind your way up to the rest of them, their special mallets and pucks and some other unblockables, such as concept art, pieces of background for the diffferent characters, etc. Each enemy has their own mallet and puck and a special move, but the concept of the game is always the same.

Some people have said it resembles Star Wars Tatooine cantina aesthetics, and it does indeed. There's even a ""Twi'lek"" girl and a guy cosplayed as Han Solo, and every alien is very Star Warsy, so if you like the saga then you'll probably find Sufflepuck Cantina attractive to the eye. Most defining trait is the grinding, which many people have complained about; there's no ingame purchases inherited from its former app game nature, yet you will need tons of ingame currency to buy everything, from access to more challenging enemies to new mallets and its upgrades. As there are only 13 enemies and the only mechanics in the game are the short, intense air hockey matches (no other minigames included), this may get repetitive after a while. You can, however, buy your classic coin doubler upgrade, which I recommend you to do first thing (there are a couple upgrades for the puck to give you money when it hits the table and the mallet).

Also the lack of multiplayer really damages a game like this one, which could use it to add some replayability and extra fun. However, the developers are considering to add it in the future if they get funding, and you can read about it in the Steam forums. I had this game on a bundle so I will definitely be investing a couple bucks :p 

+ Cute design and characters
+ Addictive and tons of unlockable content
+ Polished and responsive controls and puck behavior

+/- Some people may find the grinding annoying, while others (like me) may find it catchy

- The concept gets repetitive quickly
- No multiplayer (although it could have it eventually)
- Some will find 10€ is a bit pricey due to lack of variety

After playing for 6 or 7 hours I say it's a good game, fun and with a fair amount of content, but it can get old quickly. If, like me, you are a sucker for casual games and achievement hunting, you will sure enjoy it. If you are looking for a more hardcore game, I would advice to avoid this one, specially at full price, as some will consider it to be a bit too much for what it offers; I had it in a bundle though, so I am more than happy with the value. I totally recommed it if you get it on sale and enjoy some good old casual gaming."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,Where has the VR support gone? The reason I bought this game was for VR! Bring it back.
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"I puchased this game over a year ago, and played it a lot on my DK2.  After getting my new headset I came back to it only to find the steam version doesn't work in VR, and I need to buy it again on the Oculus Store to play it.  Would appriciate an Oculus Store key to play again, as it stands now, I am going to give thumbs down."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Surprisingly addictive. The background music gets a tad anoying, but that's the worst of it. If you ever enjoyed air hockey you  will enjoy this."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"I bought this for the VR support. Now, like a year later, I go to install it, and lo and behold, the VR has been removed and added in another version. That's a bad business practice. I loved the game in VR, but I won't be paying for it again."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"It was good until they removed VR support. What a rip off....
Also the studio isn't answering any question over the last few years."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Nice way of wasting your time while listnening to your favourite records just like playing Pinball.
Handeling the mallets, pucks and timing your effects feels great and you'll get better with every game you play.

The oponents you'll face all have their different style of gameplay. Hunting the achievements is fun.I don't like my games frustrating but with shufflepuck I don't mind very much. The games are fast, short and fun."

Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"[TL;DR -- An unexpectedly addictive and beautifully presented game, well worth the $7.99-$9.99 USD price-point in my humble opinion.]

Though not a regular player of Arcade games, I thought I would make a foray into the genre when I picked up the newly-released Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe (SCD) for $7.99 USD. The game consists of playing Shufflepuck (essentially air hockey) against a series of increasingly challenging opponents to win points and money (known as ‘Credz’), ultimately in order to build a new spaceship to return home to Earth. Although a fairly simple premise, the game mechanics are well executed, and the opponents are sufficiently diverse to keep the game interesting and fresh as you progress.

The game takes place in a five-level Cantina, where Shufflepuck is the key form of entertainment for patrons. The graphics are crisp and polished, with each area of the Cantina having its own style. There are indeed no loading times, and the player can seamlessly travel between each level of the Cantina via an elevator. Four of the levels are populated by three opponent characters each (with the fifth level devoted to a single ‘Boss’ opponent), as well as bystanders and props. The activity in each area is sufficient to bring the game to life, but is subtle so as to not distract the player.

Each of the 12 regular opponents have unique mallets and pucks, as well as unique ‘special moves’, which the player is able to obtain and use as they progress through the game. The different special moves employed by each opponent adds greatly to the challenge of the game, as the player must adapt quickly to avoid defeat, particularly when required to face a series of different foes in attempting to complete each character’s ‘mini-quests’. The Shufflepuck matches are challenging, particularly those which require the player to concede no points over the course of the match. There’s a genuine sense of achievement in a flawless 15-0 victory against a difficult opponent.

As the player progresses, more points and Credz are amassed, as well as Tokens. Points are used to determine the player’s Level, which provides bonuses, as well as to rank the player amongst their friends and the global playerbase. Credz are used to purchase items from the Store, such as puck and mallet improvements, as well as the biography of each opponent character. Tokens can be exchanged for points or Credz via a ‘prize machine’, which involves a random-chance card-flipping interface akin to a slot machine, and may be subject to bonuses derived from your Level. 

The character biographies are well thought-out and consistent, and provide a back-story to the player to explain some of the feuds between characters the player will notice during the game. SCD does not have a narrative or story arc in the way that many FPS or RPG games do, however the character dialogue and biographies do a good job of filling that void, bearing in mind the context of an Arcade game.

All-in-all, I am very happy with my purchase and got a solid 20 hours of entertainment before finishing the core game missions. No doubt it would require many more hours to achieve 100% completion. The game is executed to a standard well above what I expected, indeed well above what I would expect of any new 3D game at the $9.99 USD or below price-point from an independent game developer. 

I would recommend to all, but particularly those who are fond of Arcade games. This game is fun, challenging and accessible, and at less than 100MB download, you’ll be able to jump into it almost immediately."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"So this was originally sold as ""Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe VR"" with Oculus DK2 support. And I played it for few hours in VR, pretty fun.
But Steam still suggests that VR title in name to buy that as gift for a friend.

False advertising and possibly removed VR headset support? I suppose it MIGHT work with DK2 on out-of-date DK2 drivers but can't confirm since I'm currently using Vive.

Thumbs down.

Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,It's a fun game in short bursts.
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Boring game, extremely repetitive. You have to play the same character so many times it's absurd to fully unlock a biography from them just to get their paddle. I mean it seems great as an app game, but as a sit down one it's pretty ass. 

On the plus side it looks fantastic and everything fits the theme real well

Doesn't matter how pretty it is though, after playing the same robot bartender 40 times just to get enough gold medals to unlock all his biography shit to get a color change on your puck, you start to hate it. I'd pay like 3$ for this max."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Yes, it's Shufflepuck Cafe.  In 2013.

How MUCH like the original?
Well, I keep doing the thing where you'd smash the puck, only to have the baton or whatever it is called get in FRONT of the puck, and then I move backwards to reset - and smash the puck into my own goal.  That happened on the original, and it happens here.
The 2nd floor has a good remix of the original tune.
Now, there are extras - you have to collect parts of your spaceship and thus play a lot of games vs. the characters, rather than just get to Biff via playing various others.  Also I haven't seen my favorite, the character who'd get drunk gradually and then you'd beat the crap out of him because he was WASTED.  Oh wait, maybe he's on floor 2 - maybe he's the insect that is at the bar there.
The little guy with the eyes is named 'Furry' and he is essentially a cat. There are biographies of each type, and quests.

The ONLY problem with the game is there is no Paranoimia cracktro on the front.  Felix Schmidt's music on that is brilliant and I kinda wish it was in the game somewhere.

Also, yay this was in the shop so I could buy it.  I never saw, or was given the option to purchase, the original, in stores or elsewhere.

Yes, I like this game (:"
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Cantina Deluxe has nothing on Cafe.

The good old Shufflepuck Cafe, when I played it back in another age on a Mac Classic in my school's computer room, was immensely challenging, with each character taking serious skill to beat. Each had their distinct play style, each responded perfectly to some moves and were susceptible to others, each served in semi-predictable or totally unpredictable ways, and all the opponents were ranked from easiest to impossibly hard, and rightfully so. Maybe there was nothing else to the game, it was pretty simple after all, but the gameplay made up for the simplicity. 

Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe introduced 3-D graphics, in VR for those so equipped, and added tons of extras - a multitude of mallets and pucks and ""embodiments"" to choose from, quests, missions, collectibles, and let's not forget special attacks... Too bad that the core gameplay fell far, far short behind the original's. All the opponents have exactly the same core difficulty level - even the newbies can successfully defend against fast cross-courts and rebounds, and even the boss occasionaly fails to catch a slow shot. They differ only with their serve technique (perfectly predictable after 2 or 3 rounds), special moves (also perfectly predictable, except for Phan-Le's ""cannonball"", but those turn matches against him into mindless smashfests along one side, until he finally misses). Also the concept of mastering special moves is completely useless, as opponents randomly either defend against lightning fast specials, or hopelessly fail to hit a technique executed by accident and slow as a snail.

Then there's the progression, represented by collecting points, credz and completing quests. Again, however, they're ridiculous in design: ""boss"" missions, completed to collect spaceship quests, are simple ""reach 15 points"" matches, of which I have not lost even one as a whole; characters' quests, in turn, often involve winning over a dozen points in ""survival"" mode against an opponent, which is far more time-consuming (considering opponents being as predictable as described above). And while the easy spaceship missions award game-finishing items, the hard survival matches yield points and rewards ten times smaller than a single match against any high-level opponent. Oh, and the final boss of bosses? He's just as hopeless, his only power is that he switches between styles of all the other characters with each ball played.

But an experienced player should easily complete the game by beating all the opponents, right? Nope. The spaceship parts take credz (cash) to obtain, and those are collected by grinding, that is playing hundreds, thousands even, of boring, repetitive matches against inept opponents.

Bottom line? Avoid this, if you expect a challenge similar to the old Shufflepuck Cafe. This remake is a shameful disgrace, just wrapped in pretty graphics."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,It's a fun sci-fi take on air hockey and it's a marvel how good it looks and sounds despite being only a 55MB download. Beyond that though...wow...this is the worst case of mobile F2P grinding garbage I have found on steam. You will absolutely want to find a cheat tool or something to give yourself more currency. This is really shameful. It expects you to beat every character a few hundred times to really fulfill every goal. You'll lose interest completely by the third match with each of them. I paid about $1.21 after selling some cards and using a coupon and I still think it was a bit of a rip off.
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"I do recommend the game if you NEVER played any air hockey or even shufflepuck game - in game or in real life (if you don't know air hockey, try it at least once, it is cool). I do recommend this game too if like me, you remember your teenage time playing Shufflepuck Cafe on Atari... good times. Now, I would not recommend this game just like that, because it is not that great. It is fine. Very repetitive (that's air hockey... better in real life with real friends), very grindy (win 15 times against him - good, now beat him 8 times without loosing - good, now you can duel the new opponent... who tells you to beat the previous one 10 times...), and the table is a TAD too small (actually, there is too much camera inclination), BUT the gameplay is really smooth, the different opponents moves are nice though as too simple as the original game, so, yeah, overall it is enough to pass the time if you buy it on sale.

Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,Played the original Shufflepuck Café on the Amiga 500 back in the day. This reboot/sequel does a decent job of capturing the gameplay and atmosphere of the original.
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"I was never a big fan of this game back in the Amiga days, when it was merely Shufflepuck Cafe. Now the joint has been upgraded to become a Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe. The core gameplay is the same, PC air hockey, and while it is extremely simple to play, it's anything but simple to beat the majority of your opponents.

Now featuring upgradeable pucks and mallets, along with the ability to acquire special shots (so your opponents are no longer the only players with tricks up their sleeve), the game now offers quite a bit more to tweak the core gameplay. There are also more opponents, although the difficulty level ramps up a lot more steeply than it did in it's earlier Amiga incarnation. Acquiring the necessary credz to purchase upgrades isn't limited to just beating your opponent. There are also collectable credz (as well as experience points) on the air hockey table itself, plus there is some kind of alien fruit machine available to try your luck on, in order to win extra credz and experience points.

The Cantina itself features 4 floors, with 3 opponents on each floor. As you earn more credz, you can purchase access to the other floors, where tougher opponents and greater rewards await you. There are also other items for purchase, such as concept art and biographies (in 18 parts) of each of your opponents. Purchasing these all help towards your ultimate goal, acquiring enough parts to repair your spaceship and return home.

This is a strangely addictive little game that is perhaps a bit pretentious in it's execution. It's almost like the developer wants people to think it is more than just air hockey, as if that alone wouldn't be enough to interest people. The bottom line is it IS just air hockey on the PC, but that isn't a bad thing, many of the best video games are due to their simplicity. That said, i only purchased this because i had a coupon for it, bringing the price down to £1.75. I think it is a good and i do recommend it, but only if you get one of these coupons or if the game goes on sale. At £2 it's great value for money, but at the full £6.99 price i don't think i would be recommending as much."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"It is a very nice remake of Shufflepuck Cafe :) It requires a huge amount of grinding, but it does it in a quite rewarding way. Learning the patterns of your opponents is actually fun! You have a lot of things to do off the table and it doesn't get boring if you like shufflepuck. This game is for people that liked the original game and/or like shufflepuck for what it is. The biographies are nice to read, but they won't make up for a decent story driven game. Play the game for what it is and you get a lot of very good gameplay :) It's even addictive once you get into it ;)

Recommended for everybody that likes shufflepuck and/or loved the game Shufflepuck Cafe! At a sale price of 2.50 $ I'd recommend it to everyone that likes a mildly challenging sport game with a lot of 'side-tracked' activities :)"

Rating : 7 / 10

This game is a port from the tablet game where it is freely available for some time now. Porting from such devices is normally done quite well but this one has lost some of it polish, especially when it comes down to the interface speed. If you don't own a tablet version, than you have nothing to worry about :)

The gameplay has remain the same, and playing with the mouse is far far better than your fingers. As you don't have to hold a device, you really can focus on playing the game, which is downright fun. Learning the moves of your opponent is quickly done and than it's off to your own skill to defeat them. The learning curve is gentle and you're quick into the game. You have 19 different opponents to beat which scale up nicely. Your skill should too so after a while to really notice you can actually beat that dude that smacked you in the ass a few hours earlier.

Nice about the game is that it rewards you a lot. Either with coins, experience points or achievements, it all adds up to that 'just want to play one more game' feeling.

Music and sounds are ok, only thing is that the music from the Hall keeps hangin' on hours after you stopped playing. 1920's music isn't that great but this tune keeps coming back... 

Overall the game is fun to play and keeps you interested for a while until your skill doesn't increase any more or you just get bored."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Reading some of the negative reviews really don't do this game justice!

It's charming, with just the right level of difficulty. Depending what you're after anyways. The main game itself I wouldn't say is overly difficult once you get each enemies abilities memorized. Where it really begins to become a challenge is grinding out some of the later missions though. Honestly an advantage in my opinion as the game offers something for both casual and grindy players.

Plenty of items to collect for completionists, you can unlock your favourite enemies abilities for your own use, it has a leaderboard to climb, along with plenty of achievements.

As mentioned in other reviews, it's pretty much a Star Wars/Alien themed air hockey game. For what it has to offer I'd say it's worth the $10.99 mostly if you plan on grinding out achievements and missions though. Otherwise for the amount of game time needed to just beat the main game maybe wait till it's on sale."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"It's like the old MS DOS game Shufflepuck Café. Even the music is almost the same. Very entertaining, but a bit grindy though. If you liked the old one, you will love this too, because it's basically the same game with nice graphics, more opponents, special moves and a store, where you can buy pucks and mallets for your in-game points."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"A game of air hockey/shufflepuck/air puck; whatever you want to call it, based on a pseudo Star Wars like planet hence the name.  Fast reactions count, very fun in short bursts. 6/10"
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,Quite a fun little game. You are a space travler who gets dumped on some remote planet and must rebuild your damaged spacecraft. You accomplish this by playing many many games of what I would call air hockey. Tons of puck and mallet upgrades to purchase with crez ( in game currency). Plus all your opponents offer you several missions which unlock lots of urgrades and special shots you can make with the puck and mallets. Visuals in the game are very vibrant and colorful. Only played for a short while to get my card drops but I would recommend this to anyone looking for a casual game to play. 8 out of 10.

Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"A great remake of the old Shufflepuck Cafe from the late 80s. The gameplay is simple and fluid. The graphics are nice and unobtrusive and working well with the atmosphere the developers tried to create: the game now takes place not in a Cafe but a Cantina on a desert planet - very reminiscent of a similar establishment in a certain wretched hive of scum and villainy. Even the music fits.
The game has recieved some sense of progression. The cantina has multiple floors and you need to earn credz to purchase access to them. The patrons you can challenge all have little quests (which basically require you to play even more shufflepuck), unlockable background information and eventually you can earn their special equipment and skills.
In a way recommending it is like recommending Pinball: can you see yourself playing the same thing over and over and over and having fun? If the answer is yes, then yes, the game is a lot of fun and highly recommended."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,Lovely and fun air hockey inspired game. Cantina reminds me of Star Wars <3

Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Single player only airhockey with upgrades, super strikes, all that jazz. It has a quest system (matches with specific modifiers) and player levels which means that you have an incentive to continue playing. It's pretty fun.

There are occasional physics glitches but they're mostly in your favour. And the first level of the bar has music that is almost the starwars cantina theme. If you listen to it for long enough it might break you."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Linux: set up by enabling /dev/input/event* to have read permission for the mouse to work.  Otherwise had zero issues as a Linux user.

I love these kinds of games, and this one delivered:

The main thing here is the controls/gameplay are more fun than you would expect.  I mainly bought this game because of nostalgia from an old tablet game, but am already having a lot more fun than expected with a mouse.  There's enough variety in the gameplay that other similar games I've played seem a bit ""flat"" in comparison.

The second thing is how fast it gets you into the action.  There's a tutorial, but it's skippable.  The story stuff can barely bring down the pace, but does a great job of adding incentive to keep playing.  Ignoring all that, the game launches quickly and there's barely any clicks before you're quickly setting up a game.  It's a smooth and extremely well presented/executed process imo.

The personal nitpicks I have against are minor and rarely get in the way of playing.  It being a bit unclear of the ""best"" way to earn rewards.   If/how neutral power-ups impact the AI.  Stuff like I can't find a volume control (only music/sound on/off) and the default is probably loud because of that.  For the last one, I'm catching up on my own music collection in the background anyway, so adjusted that to the sound effects volume.

Overall, Shufflepuck is a nice balance between getting you into the action and providing enough presentation/gameplay variety to keep you interested in one more match.  If you've enjoyed an Air Hockey type game before, digital or physical, this is worth picking up."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Quality game, great for a quick five minute game of air hockey, or for a longer achievement-chasing session. Practically a must-buy if you catch it on sale, but still great value at full price. Shame they don't appear to have made a demo available; any uncertain buyers would be convinced to part with their cash by being able to play a couple of games."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Do you remember an old shufflepuck game where you squared off against aliens?  Everything you liked about that game is here!  Weird looking aliens/robots/etc. want you to challenge them to a game of shufflepuck (think air hockey), and they have lots of dirty tricks up their sleeves to win.  A great game to pick up and play for a few minutes at a time or if you get into it there are plenty of missions, quests and unlockables to work towards.  

The only thing lacking is a multiplayer mode, this game would be great to go against friends or setup a tournament with.  If this game blasts off into popularity I'm sure the devs will start working on it."

Issues with the game:
1. Minor bugs
2. Grinding hell to complete missions / achievements (story is short, 4-8 hours, missions 50+ hours).
3. Difficulty is low, at least compared to shufflepuck cafe from 89.
4. Game seems built around the pay to win concept but not incorporated.
5. Once you buy what you want / need, creditz are useless and will build to huge amounts.
6. Mission are bland (it wouldn't be hard to add certain criteria to missions, like ""score ace"", score x within y minutes or whatever).
7. Unbalanced creditz, tokens and score, the need for one will shift drastically over time."

Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,okey really sweet and easy game but easy to get mad on too
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,Extremely good update of a classic. Highly recommended.
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"I’m recommending this game with one very big caveat:

People who remember the original “Shufflepuck Cafe” from Broderbund Software will LOVE this game! It’s a great looking and VERY faithful homage to the original, right down to the broken glass and the music in one of the areas. That said, I’m not so sure it could keep the interest of today’s gamers for long.

The game is basically just air hockey. They’ve added a silly stranded-on-an-alien-planet premise, to explain what you’re even doing there, because... you know... that matters!  In fact, the game gives FAR more to the player than I ever would have expected. There’s different game modes, different areas with different opponents presenting different challenges. There’s points and rankings, money, a slots game with prizes, dozens of different mallets and pucks to unlock, etc, etc. 

There's even a back-story to unlock for each of the opponents you face, with their own little place in the sci-fi universe of Shufflepuck Cantina!

I’m serious... There’s a Sci-Fi Universe... for an air hockey game!

Ultimately, you’re supposed to unlock all the character’s back-stories to get “parts” for your crashed spaceship. Once you’ve done that, you'll challenge the “end boss” who has the last part, presumably so you can finally leave this charming little Tatooine knockoff!

To be honest, even as nostalgic as I am, I doubt I’ll ever actually put in enough time to get that far. But you have to admire Agharta Studio for having put so much effort and imagination into such a simple game. Bravo!"
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"It's a paid PC port of a free-to-play mobile game that rips off Star Wars and wraps its skin around a bar game you will have to not only beat but grind, hundreds of times, to win.

The fact that I still like this game is why I will never, ever be a credible human being."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"9/10 great casual.
Definitely a worthy remake of the old Amiga classic.
Nostalgia hasn't been ruined, the added stuff really does add to the game, all rond great reboot.
Absolutely worth it for those of us who enjoyed the original, and worth a pop in the sales for anybody who enjoys casual games or quirky simple games of any sort."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"+cheap
+nostalgia (the old amiga game)

-survival mode is quite boring
-no difficulty setting for those who want more of a challenge"
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Nice throwback to the original, great phyiscs and fun upgrade engine.  The mini game is silly."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Do you like air hockey?, do you like the feeling you get when you push yourself to succeed and grow as a gamer?, Do you own a  gaming mouse? If the answers to all these questions  are yes then this is the game for you! I've never had such are realistic sports games experience, and have seldom had more fun playing air hockey.  A definite purchase!"
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,Fun game since it was on Amiga
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,A lot of fun.
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,Got the oculus key today.  It works well in VR.
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,Can't wait to play on the rift!
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"I used to play the old Shufflepuck Cafe for the Mac (actually I think there was a shareware version I played before it became Shufflepuck Cafe). Long time ago. But this feels similar, and that is great, because it is one of the great casual games that you can waste a lot of time on. I got this for the DK2 (works with 0.6.0 fine), and it is probably the best VR experience yet. If you have a DK2 you need this. I have played a short time so far, but love it."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Little game that is way too grindy.

It was kinda fun for 30 minute then I realised how much of a grind this game would be... The first floor doesn't pay enought to buy anything so I had the brilliant idea that maybe in the higher floors I could make more money... The game is designed in this way, except that without any special strike or better paddle or puck, you get melted even just at the floor just above you. The end result, I don't want to spend 3 hours on the first floor only to get 1 special strike, then another 2 to get a better paddle so I might stand a chance on the 2nd floor... To do this all over again. I regret buying this game, even on sale. The idea was promissing and seemed like a fun little game to blow off steam. It isn't."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Looks nice.

Gameplay didn't feel quite right - the responsiveness of the puck and the collision detection both seemed off to me, and I got more frustrated at the game than at myself for losing points.

The amount of grinding required to unlock game content puts Final Fantasy to shame.

Overall, there's not much to recommend this."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,no controller support
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Game of choice for my wife. Easy and brilliant.

Well, I thought one stroke is enough for that game, but no. Okay, I'll give more info here:
It's one of the greatest casual games I ever played or will be playing at any time in the future. It's a perfect little game, 20/10 grade since my wife likes it. I repeat it because quite contrary to me, my wife usually doesn't play video games at all.

The base of the game - aero hockey, which features a mouse control quite natural. Cantina - of course, referral to the Star Wars universe, but, it's only aesthetic, no nerd deepness here. Just refined pleasure."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"This is why Steam needs a Mixed button. Buggy un updated game since 2013 and really just a sad mess. Unfortunately, I will be keeping it as I used to play it on my phone before they removed it from the play store. I miss it and the game is pretty good with a Star Wars feel, interesting characters and fun gameplay, under the old age and messy bugs, like you can't alt tab cause the game crashes... Shame they never bothered updating it, fixing it to fit the times and just giving it a tiny bit of love…"
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"good idea, but too repetitive and difficult, would have been a lot better if it was a point and click adventure game"
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"I consider this game a worthy successor to Shufflepuck Cafe.

The table is a bit short, but gameplay feels smooth enough.  Winning games rewards you with in-game currency that you can use to unlock special pucks and mallets with power-ups.

And also the opponents have trick shots, where the puck violates the laws of physics.

On the downside, some of the characters make gross sound effects, and you can't disable voices without also disabling all sound effects.  :(

It won't change your life, but it is fun when you have five minutes."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"One of few decent VR titles at the time. I loved the original Shufflepuck Cafe as a kid and this is a worthy successor.

It will no doubt be overshadowed by VR bar games with multiplayer and explorable  interactive environments now but it's still worth a look if you want something immersive without motion controllers.
"
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,Loved this game on the Dk2! I hope they port it over to HTC Vive!
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"If you have a VR headset then add this to your collection of games. 

I'd have never thought I would enjoy an air hockey game but I love this and use this as one of my chill out games as even though real air hockey could be quite exhilarating I feel totally relaxed and focussed in VR.

The graphics and effects are pretty cool, reminding me of the Star Wars universe and the controls are easy. I do find the opponents seem to be able to use their special abilities fairly easily but so far I am coping hehe

For such a small team (3 people) I think they've done a pretty good job. Thanks!  :)"
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Basically it's just Air hockey, but with differnet paddles and the such. I liked it while I played it, for quite some time actually.
Get it when it's on sale as a casual-play-it-here-and-there type of game."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"People who experienced the late 80s might recall Shufflepuck Café. It was an air-hockey game with a SF/Cyberpunk flavor. Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is a modern tribute to this old classic, in a less dark atmosphere but still full of sci-fi references from Star Wars to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"A comfy game not too large in scale, but with enough depth to be entertaining for atleast a few hours. Admittedly I didn't complete it, as it's a bit of a grind playing air hockey all day when it gets harder and harder as you face new characters until I just wanted to give up, but it was a nice experience.

★★★★☆"
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Speaking as an owner of Rift DK2, I can recommend this game.

It's a great ""comfortable"" VR game, and it's done very well."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Playing air hockey suits perfectly with Oculus as you (as player in a room) are not moving a lot- so you are not getting sea-sick and you have to use only mouse- no peeking for buttons nor keyboard keys. A bit surprisngly for me Oculus works really well with that kind of table games (btw, is it HD actually?). Very enjoyable."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"PLENTY ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT: The Shufflepuck Sequel

With a community of around 50.000 Steam owners, Shufflepuck Cantina proves to be a fairly successful game, especially taken the price of 10 Euro into account. A rational question arising is the price/performance ratio. A way to answer this question is through a comparison with the original: Shufflepuck Café. 

Doing so, a lot of opposing pairs come into mind, for example what's new, what's missing:
What about the game mechanics? You take your mouse and move it from left to right, forwards, backwards, that's nothing new, even the splitting glass when you hit some background is the same as before. The one thing that is new though are the special strikes, but you could claim that they lack of originality. Why is that? They are predictable. Well, Shufflepuck Cafe was predictable as well, to a certain extend, but it seems to be no abuse of notation to approve that Shufflepuck Cantina is even more predictable. For example, a ""noise decision"" is not present any longer as it was before with the magician lady in Shufflepuck Café. You could also claim that Biff was tuffer to beat than Lord Emell is at present. Against Biff, one could only score by switching corners quickly and through counter strikes using the energy he threw into the puck. Emell uses all special strikes of all enemies, and that's it, his defence is not hard to break, one could claim.

From this point of view, one could question the philosophy of the game, the ultimate goal besides of earning a living. What's the challenge? In Shufflepuck Café, it was a challenge to sweep Biff, but the predictability of Shufflepuck Cantina leads to more conditional aspects. As a game with Biff was to win or loose 15 points, this element has been transfered to Shufflepuck Cantina in form of the Spaceship Parts Challenges. But there are other types of challenges in addition: Duels, bets and survival mode. But as the special strikes do not really differ from each other, so do these challenge modes. They are all somewhat based on the fact that a sweep is the best way of winning a game in terms of time and points. 

And the last mentioned is a crucial factor. Like many other games nowadays, the achivement bar tries to keep the player up with the game although he already could have gained the impression of having mastered it. Is it an achivement to do the same things over and over again? That's a philosophical question and shall not be answered right here and right now.
But it can, of course, be annoying after some time and this would depend on the individual, one could say. 

So, there seems to be nothing new and you could easily call Shufflepuck Cantina a remake of Chufflepuck Café, but not as difficult as the original, but more costly in terms of time and money. This summing-up impression rises especially after considering the complexity of the elaboration of the additional features: They are all separated from each other, for example, you cannot combine special strikes and there is only one feature (as shields, double strikes, reduced mallets or pucks)  affecting the gameplay at a time. Combinations in this area would make the game more unpredictable and it would be more difficult to sweep an opponent and one could surely arrange the achivement bars with such a new difficulty level.

Therefore, the only excuse left for such a lack of elaboration seems to be the development budget. Is it?

Speaking of the price/perforamnce ratio again, the graphics and musics aren't too bad, multiplayer is missing, it could appear to be too expensive after all (75% off would do). It also appears to be no game for someone looking for an effective challenge with more variations in comparision to the original."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,Best VR game to this point. The graphics are amazing and controls are perfect. Great job!
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"I have played many VR games since i got my hands on the Oculus Rift DK2 and i must say that this one really stands up from the bunch. The developers really took every aspect of the VR world in consideration which means that every text windows as been made perfectly readable for the eyes and no useless motions has been added which could've caused some motion sickness. The graphics are nice and the 3D environnements is quite immersive for that type of simple game. I've heard some people saying that it's repetitive, well it's a shufflepuck game so you definitely have to do alot of shufflepucking hahaha The game still find it's way to make you come back at it with alot of objectives and unlockables.

Need more VR games from you guyz you rock!"
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"I played this game when I was young, as a 2D game in MS-DOS. I have to say, these guys made a brilliant game out of this, a great experience! Creates nostalgia and is absolutely beautiful to see."
Out of the Park Baseball 22,Sports,1455660,"very in depth baseball manager, which is really cool, but the ui is super unfriendly and can at points make the game miserable. a lot of cool stuff that would be great if you manage to find it behind some obscure tab. would recommend starting at the AAA level to learn the beast."
Out of the Park Baseball 22,Sports,1455660,"The base game is good. ""Perfect Team"" is a garbage money grab along the lines of EA's microtransaction vehicle ""Ultimate Team"" with all of the usual BS that accompanies that. The biggest difference is that at least in EA's games you can actually actively play with the cards your kids gambled all your money to get. In OOTP, it is completely passive and the company simulates the games while you have no control over the outcome except to set the lineup. 

There is a problem, though. Cheating is rampant and there is selective enforcement of the rules. The highest level players have up to 7 or 8 accounts, which they use to funnel rare cards and ""Perfect Points"" (the game's gambling currency) to their main account. As long as you don't do anything egregious, they let you get away with it. It ruins the game for anyone trying to play normally, but I'm sure it makes people spend money to keep up, so it isn't banned. Multiple accounts stack the odds towards one person by allowing them to enter more than 3 tournaments at a time, having more cards for sale at a time, etc. and there are people openly doing it with teams like ""Dave's Team 1"" through ""Dave's Team 15"", etc. These teams can and do compete in the same leagues and tournaments as each other.

The only way to get caught is to sell yourself a card for like 10 times its price, which is what I did because I was getting bored with the game. They deleted my whole account with no warning, which I'm actually fine with because this style of gaming should be, and hopefully soon will be, illegal. It's pure pay to win. If you try to compete for free, you just can't keep up. I refuse to pay for anything more than a base video game so I got good. I had won over 150 tournaments, and thus had ripped thousands of packs, and I was still not even close to having a competitive team before I started doing what everyone else does and got banned.

All you have to do to see what level of integrity this company has is read the reviews of their buggy, broken mobile app on Google Play or the App Store. They charge one dollar per season of baseball that you want to be able to play (150 years of baseball)! And it doesn't even work! They ""let"" your kids gamble on Perfect Team on it for free though, of course. Scummy developers and scummy players."
Out of the Park Baseball 22,Sports,1455660,"I am not a baseball guru, but I'm learning. This game, at first, seemed quite overwhelming. The menu system seemed a little sluggish as I didn't know how to do some things (like moving players from 40 man to Active Squad and such)..after a while, right clicking a player seemed to be the best way to do most things I wanted to do (instead of going into the player's profile, like I originally thought). With that said, I am totally digging this game!! There's lots of depth, strategy is decent enough, pbp option is nice if you wanted to watch every pitch and such, but I like that the option is available to take some of the slowness out of baseball and mainly show just the most important parts of the game.
An audible commentator, would be a nice added option (maybe choose between text or audio) :)"
Out of the Park Baseball 22,Sports,1455660,This game is for for stat nerds.  The depth of data is amazing.  Historical and international team stats and data.   The gameplay part sucks.  Graphics look 15 years old which would be fine but the animations are choppy and unnatural.  UI is okay but the search functions are good.  The stats over a season are spot on but game to game they can be nonsensical and confusing.  I can't recommend this game unless you are a miserable stat nerd like me.
Out of the Park Baseball 22,Sports,1455660,"[h1]9½ out of 10, if this is what you're looking for.[/h1]

PCs and consoles are swimming in BB games where you swing the bat, you throw the pitch, you field the grounder at the hot corner, but what if you just want to manage? Well, praise the Gods of Gaming, we have this! The game offers all current teams with real players (it's fully licensed), and also any recorded team from history going back to 1871. Remember 1984 when the Padres met the Tigers in the World Series? You can play that year; take the Tigers and enjoy dominating everyone, or take the Padres and see if you could do better.

Playing as manager of your chosen team, you set the lineups, the pitching rotation, stand up relievers, bring the infield in, or call for the squeeze. It's all under your command using players with dozens of ratings and stats, some of which I've never heard of. But be careful! You can read the stats from the record page, but if your scout doesn't understand the nuances of baserunning, his assessments in that area will be highly suspect.

Add the role of GM to your plate, and you can offer and accept trades, move players up and down between your farm teams (yes, they're all here, too), negotiate salaries, and deal with holdouts and injury replacements. If business is your interest, you can do all that  without managing. Or take on both roles with flawless controls.

So why just 9½? There is no announcer; the play-by-play is printed in a box at the top of the screen. Realistically, the manager in the dugout probably wouldn't be listening to the play-by-play, but it makes for a rather sterile experience. Still, I most highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to manage a baseball team through a career without being bothered to replace every player's baseball skills with your joystick skill on every play of every game. If you've been looking for that game, look no farther; this is it!"
Out of the Park Baseball 22,Sports,1455660,"Not all that different from previous iterations, but some nice additions to this one including better stability. I'd recommend this version to anyone interested but if you're not concerned about updated rosters or 64-bit play, you can probably get an earlier version cheaper.

Now, what do we have to do to get an NBA version of this?"
Out of the Park Baseball 22,Sports,1455660,"This game is really fun if you play it on commissioner mode.  Otherwise, the high volume of artificial cheese will give you multiple heart attacks."
Out of the Park Baseball 22,Sports,1455660,"I am having a lot of fun building my perfect league team.  You only have a few packs of players to start.  You gain free points while playing that you can use to buy more packs.  You can go to the auction house to find players you need to round out your team.  They won't be the best players, because you don't have many points.  But you can get some pretty good players randomly in the packs.  There is a pay-to-win element because people can pay to buy points, which means if you spend a lot of money you can make a really good team.  However, the leagues are broken into tiers, and those uber-teams will quickly move to the highest tier leagues.  I'm having fun playing at my level, picking which players I want on the team from my smaller roster.  I even moved up a tier and may move up another tier (fingers crossed).

I'm also having fun playing a single player campaign starting in 1870, but keep stopping to see how my perfect league team is doing in the season."

Dota 2,Strategy,570,"I've spent 10 years and almost 10,000 hours playing Warcraft III DotA as well as Dota 2, and loved playing it. I've met many interesting people, fought epic battles, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat through several Herculean efforts, endured many soul crushing defeats, and even clashed with a handful of professional players. The game has changed drastically over my many years of playing, but as of about a year ago, the game became too frustrating to continue, and as I continue to watch, I am saddened by what the game has become.

For years my friends and I have joked about the ""League-ification"" of Dota. Dota has always been the epitome of hyper competitive cooperative gameplay, with a high emphasis on individual skill and decision making at all phases of the game, especially in punishing poor decisions. Pushing a tower alone with nobody showing on the map? Get back or you're dead. Hard carry dies past 40 minutes without buyback? That's a barracks down. Pick crappy laning heroes? Welcome to hell while the enemy team runs a trilane and pushes barracks at 20 minutes.

Our jokes slowly but surely became a reality. Teleport scrolls were reduced in cost, meaning everybody rolled around with a handful because they weren't a financial burden. Ways to gain gold were increased, so supports could afford to have a handful of items in the mid game. The rubber band effect was introduced, and pushing strategies were neutered. You pick a lineup to take towers and take one unfavorable engagement and the game's over, whereas previously the greedier lineup would have to do more work than a single fight to overcome the gold advantage. The cost of boots was reduced, taking boots first strategies from a sure sign that you were bad to a viable strategy. Strong laners also got pushed out. Dominating the early game became effectively irrelevant as killing giant money bag heroes in the midgame would slingshot the trailing team into the lead.

The worst casualty has been the versatility of the game. Metas change and stuff goes in and out of favor, that's fine and fair, but certain aspects have become imperative to have. A support with a hard save, a hard carry that can fight in the early mid game. Bad laning heroes can just be sent mid, while traditional skill mid heroes are just sent to the safelane. When you take a big lead, the plan is almost always just farm out the map until you can't possibly lose when taking the high ground, as taking a risk will not just result in you losing a fight, but most likely the lead.

The game that I grew up with that punishes the smallest mistakes is a distant memory, and we are left with a mid game brawler. I wish Dota 2 the best as it progresses, but the core mechanics have been changed so drastically that I can neither play nor watch it without feeling like something that was once an unrelenting niche game has been formed to cater to the whims of the massive casual audience that it has attracted."

Dota 2,Strategy,570,"If you want to have headaches, play this game.

If you want to have fun, play Smite or HoTS."
Dota 2,Strategy,570,"Dota 2 is Valve's MOBA title, which is to say it's a real-time strategy game where you literally play the one single map over and over again, but you play as one of 700 characters that in other RTS games would be lategame units or lynchpins of a player's entire army, individual games can take hours, and there's a shop/inventory system for some reason. As a couple of my friends put it, half the features are bugs that got left in because the dev liked them; it's a horrifying mess with a skill floor that starts where other games have a ceiling, and a skill ceiling that may or may not exist.

(Also, the lore depicts the battle represented in the game as a final cataclysm between good and evil that will destroy the world no matter who wins, which is amusing to think about considering how many times it's been played out by the game's millions of fans.)

Taken altogether, Dota 2 seems very much like a product of people who got so incredibly attached to one very particular experience that they built everything else around it - and this is the important part - warts and all. People apparently spend massive amounts of time and money on what is essentially a glorified Warcraft III mod that itself has many mods, though, so it at least proves the viability of game modding.

This is also the product that's mainly responsible for killing the old Valve, the one that produced quality games on a semi-regular basis. Thanks to the massive popularity of Dota, and to an extent Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Valve was content to sit on their butts iterating on them while screwing around with VR and reaping that store/market/microtransaction money for an entire decade before they managed to stop pretending the franchise that made them didn't exist and release Half-Life: Alyx.

I at least liked the snazzy main menu and the Half-Life 2 doot noises. Inclusion of the Counter-Strike AWP firing noise on the other hand just bewildered me."
Dota 2,Strategy,570,"Best MOBA game in existence. One of the deepest multi player games ever which makes the learning curve really high so beware, this game is not for the faint-hearted."

Dota 2,Strategy,570,"One day, a mysterous wise man introduce me to this game. ""It shall protect your virginity my lord"" he said.

In this game you can:
1- Learn at most 9 different languages in every single match
2- Kill creatures chilling in their nest without mercy and take away their gold
3- Kill other players for no apparent reason
4- Learn greetings from other countries like ""pota"", ""cibai"", ""bobo"", ""wkwk"" and ""tanga""
5- Waste your time for a single map
6- Learn to control your anger. Trust me it works 10/10.


It's like a roulette, fun until you are into pinoys (the sad truth is you do get them in every match)."

Dota 2,Strategy,570,"ok, i'm just a 2k scrub, and i love dota, dota is the best moba, the best part is that people are going to go like mid or feed, then lose mid, type jajajajajaj ez mid, or they will just skip saying they're mid, not picking the minimap position thing, pick pudge or slark, then type, yo mid, then you type, i'm already mid, then he types, no, me mid, and then you suicide
if they speak english they will say stuff like mid or carry(AKA feed or feed) and firstpick invoker or TA or shadow fiend
then theres some spanish asshole kid that doesn't know how to use the chat that will be betwen the tier 2s and the tier 1s killing your creep, and nobody is going to help you, because you're solo safe with spectre, theres a legion commander jungling, a guy that picked AA and bought a full inventory of faerie fires and a dude that is rushing shadowblade for crystal maiden, with the mid or carry dude feeding the enemy pudge that is in the midlane
the enemy team has a guy with omni that is... buying... wards... oh my god, a dude with phantom assassin, anotehr dude with monkey king and another dude with some tanky hero that is easy to play, like spirit breaker, centaur warruner, etc, and they're probably spanish
so, dota is a great game, it's only better if you're in low priority"

Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,"When I was first married, I used to get annoyed at how long my husband would spend playing this game. Then he taught me how to play it. Now I'm right there with him!"
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,Better than civ 6
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,Extremely good game that even 11 years later still holds up. There's a reason why this costs more than the more recent Civ VI. Worth every cent!
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,"This is a great reminder of the horrors that civilization and progress can bring. As the used rags under my bed have finally evolved into sentient creatures and are committing nuclear terrorism across my hard-wood flooring. You would be surprised how noisy those little tadpoles can be at night! Overall, great game."
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,"No Mac/Windows crossplay
Many of my fondest memories with this game were playing multiplayer matches with my friends, many of whom have the game on Mac. Sadly that is no longer possible :("
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,Looking at this makes me happy
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,"This game is my favorite out of all the Sid Meier's Civ series. Not only is the DLC great, but the community and workshop around this game is phenomenal. The base game is fun, challenging, and replayability is through the roof. You can come back again and again to this game and never get bored because something new always happens! The DLC is amazing too though! You can get different scenario packs, religions, or entirely new civs that will all add new elements that force you to rethink your approaches to winning your desired victory for the game. Lastly, there is a spectacular mod community for this game that can allow you to do thing you never thought could happen in civ. From ""waifu civs"" to skyrim and LOTR, there is literally a mod in the workshop for everything.

That being said, the base game alone is well worth the money, but taking into account the workshop community, the DLC, and replayability, you should definitely buy this game. This game has it's place in every persons library."
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,Hell yeah
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,ghandi aint so peaceful that man kept nuking me
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,fire
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,"also ik that this is so long it might as well be a book. im just using one of my past expieriences to give you an idea how the average civ game works. no game of civilization is ever the same!

-picks chieftan (cuz I'm bad at the game)
-picks america
-spawns as the only civilization on the continent (although I'd say island would be a better term)
-after colonizing the entire island and taking advantage of all the resources i research sailing so i dont have to be so isolated.
-I meet the Siamese
-I meet the Ottomans
-I meet the Russians
-I decide to take advantage of the new found resources and start a settlement.
-The city of Choccolocco is founded!
-i decide to go for a scientific victory
-The Siamese asked if they could be friends. Of course i accepted
-a few turns later and Russia wanted to be friends. i accepted. little did I know I would regret making friends with both these people....
-The Siamese asked if I wanted to go to war with the Ottomans. i said ""ten turns. give me ten turns then we'll talk.""
-in these ten turns i assembled every nearby military unit in the area and created a military of...2 swordsman. (the production in choccolocco was low at the time, mind you. it was a new settlement.)
-The time for war has come. i moved my 2 swordsmen straight to the one and only city of Istanbul. I attacked them...and they took out one of my men and the other one retreated.
-help
-i waited for the siamese to arrive, but they didnt come. for a second i thought that the siamese may abandon me.
-but then, when things were at there worst, the siamese came.
-and oh did they come. siamese armies came from all sides!
-but even that wasnt enough.
-thankfully the army kept the enemy busy while i built a navy and got them to the ottoman capital.
-it was fairly obvious that the siamese army wasnt enough to defeat the capital and the...ONE ARCHER. the capital and that one archer was fending off multiple armies.
-but it didnt matter. by the time the last of the siamese armies began to retreat, i had researched mathmatics and had a catapult! combine that with my navy, and I had totally won.
-my swordsman dealt the finishing blow and Istanbul was now an american city.
-the Siamese thanked me for helping them eliminate the ottomans.
-decided to focus on building up my already flourishing economy.
-then, out of nowhere, Russia declared war on the Siamese!
-at the time i was friends with both.
-both of them expected me to take there side in the war. 
-if i didnt take any side in the war, both of them will denounce me for not helping them when at war.
-if i choose a side the other will hate me and others will denounce me for betraying a friend.
-help
-i sent a scout to explore and they found a new continent AND the aztecs
-after getting an open borders agreement with the aztecs the scout explored the land and discovered that the aztecs pretty much owned the entire continent
-so colonizing that continent without going to war is outta the question....
-I found out that the aztecs dont ENTIRELY own the land. Egypt owns a single city. 
-egypt also denounced me and called me a warmongering menace because i helped a friend in need.
-well hello to you too.
-I pay Russia to make peace with the Siamese
-Me and siamese make a defensive pact
-both sides get mad at me for not helping in the war
-they still seem pretty friendly towards me tho
-Russia declares war on the Siamese
-this time i dont really have a choice but to declare war on Russia...
-luckily the city with most of the military is right near a russian city
-i attack the city
-i do most of the work
-at the end the siamese swooped in and stole the city
-WHAT THE HECK RAMKHAMHAENG?!
-i decided that it was only fair that he got the city after i got the other city in the last war we had
-since most of the units i had was killed, and i wanted to focus on my economy, i made peace with russia and eventually convinced her to make peace with the siamese
-i decided not to go into any more defensive pacts since the siamese and russia couldnt get along and this clearly wouldnt be the last war they'd have
-I also got a great scientist and decided to save him for the end
-the aztecs declare war upon egypt
-i feel sorry for egypt
-i ask russia and siam if they wanna help
-they say yes
-we go straight to the capital
-then I realize that the aztecs have plenty of time to get units to the shore while we sail across the ocean
-they decimate our armies before they even get close to the capital
-he sends all his units and attacks our continent
-he destroys egypt
-he attacks everyone
-russia makes peace and then declares war on me
-siam does too
-WHAT THE HECK RUSSIA AND SIAM?!?!
-though my units were more advanced, they were outnumbered my units
-they take istanbul
-they take choccolocco
-they sail to my continent and takes all cities except for washington
-i prepared for this and had an army ready
-i begged for peace but they refused
-i offered my smaller island bound cities
-they declined
-the city of washington, on 1842 AD, was taken by siam, who was once my strongest ally and friend.

-America has fallen

so in conclusion...its a pretty good game."

- The game is only halfway done
- You pull an all-nighter trying to win by science
- lose
- play again next week"
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,"Before people react to my thumbs down score, hold on a moment, and read the review - I explain it a bit at the end. (Honestly, this is another case where I wish Steam had a ""meh"" option.)

I've played Civilization since I was a kid. I remember wasting hours with Civ2, as well as playing the sci-fi and fantasy spin offs of it. (Anybody else remember those?) I played with Civ3, and played the heck out of Civ4. When I got around to doing Civ5, I was initially underwhelmed, but came back to it after some of the DLC went on sale. After playing it a bit more, what do I think?

Honestly, I still feel a bit underwhelmed. But here's the thing... it's not a BAD game. It certainly doesn't have the serious balance issues that Civ3 had. (I still remember medieval knights destroying modern tanks.) The leader animations are nice and smooth and less cartoony than you find in Civ4 (or even Civ6). However, after being wowed with all the different things I could do with Civ4, I would expect a lot more of this to be available in Civ5. I still remember in Civ4 sending missionaries to spread my religion in neighboring lands, upping my culture boosts, then watching as cities rebelled against their governments to join me. I can't do much like that in Civ5. Heck, even Civ2 offered a lot more - I loved it in Civ2 when I would capture the capital of an enemy nation and watch them descend into a civil war. Compared to Civ2, Civ5 feels really basic. A lot of times, I'm just sitting there, clicking on the ""Next Turn"" button because there's very little else for me to do other than wait for either something to be built or something to get researched. Why did they remove so much that made Civ4 so much more immersive?

Like I said, it's not a bad game in terms of bugs, core gameplay, graphics etc. So why did I say ""no"" to the question of ""do you recommend this game""? Because when you look down the line of Civilization titles, I just can't recommend this game above it the other titles. Honestly, I haven't even thought of bothering with Civ6 if this is the trend in the series. I feel like the Civilization games might as well be called ""Graphics Card Update 6"", because about all they are. Civ4 still holds up for me after all this time, and if anyone is curious about which game in the Civilization series to start with, I would recommend this. I would not suggest investing in Civ5 unless it's either on sale or you're such a die-hard fan that you just GOTTA have them all."
Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"this game has ruined my life, i go to a party and i am tormented and haunted by my past of popping bloons. i cannot be in the same room as a bloon as i have instant outbursts of rage and lunge at the bloons. would highly recommend."

Apes together strong."
Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"[h1]TLDR[/h1]
Bloons TD 6 is [i]the[/i] mick jagger of tower defense game. A little bit wacky, fun, unique style and definitely a jewel for TD gamers. 

[h1]Non-TLDR[/h1]
Bloons TD 6 (BTD 6), developed and published by Ninja Kiwi. The PC version was relased on Dec 17, 2018 and it is also available on the Iphone/Ipad. On Metacritic (https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bloons-td-6) it has:
[list]
    [*]0 Metascore from critic reviews
    [*]An average user score of 7.4 from 30 ratings
[/list]

If you've played Flash games before, you'd probably come across bloon td. if you are someone who loves tower defense games, you'd probably slay a ton of bloons before ninja kiwi (and other flash game developers) migrated to steam because Flash is no longer supported by Adobe. So these group of people have seen how bloon td evolved till today. 

As for the younger generations, this may seem like some wild, crazy, mess up monkey revenge business against balloons. Did i mention that it was also fun/can be frustrating at the same time?

[h1]Overview[/h1]
BTD 6 offers players 40 over maps to play. it comes in 3 difficulty and each difficulty has different set of challenges - that will test your skill and knowledge. For some odd reasons, BTD 6 has a complicated map system for online/co-op game play. 

[list]
    [*]You can't play online or co-op under the [u]standard[/u] ""play"" game. 
    [*]Daily challenges are strictly solo.
    [*]Co-op challenges can be played with friends/others over the internet.
    [*]Co-op can only be played in co-op maps.
    [*]There are 2 variations of co-op maps:
[olist]
    [*]Play the entire map
    [*]Play in 1 of the sections of the map
[/olist]
    [*]Other events/Challenges are strictly solo.
[/list]

Your towers have it's own leveling system. Aside from that, the more you play, you also gain up exp for your own account - this is the monkey knowledge system. As you level up, you gain monkey knowledge points which can be used to purchase ""perks"" for your towers or heroes tower. Yes, there are heroes tower which needs to be unlocked & purchased (not microtrans). If i am not mistaken, the first 2 heroes can be unlocked and given to you after you reach certain levels.

Other than all of the above, you now have:
[list]
    [*]Powers = non-towers that can be placed on to the map to assist you in various ways.
    [*]Insta towers = free towers that you have acquire through challenges/events. These towers come with certain upgrades already.
[/list]

On top of all of this, it has a trophy store, where you can purchase various in-game elements; visuals/ui/emoticons. Nothing that can affect the gameplay. You earn trophy from odyssey game mode. finally, it has a microtransaction shop.

BTD 6 isn't just your standard Tower Defense game with all this features.

[h1]Controls, Audio, Visuals[/h1]
Visuals: It's 3d'ish looking. colorful, clean. certain maps have objects to interact/block your line of sight. Monkeys and bloons have been properly designed. no complains. +1 to the team

Audio: Energetic vibe. I believe you can purchase additional soundtrack from the trophy store. (yet to try). There's a jukebox to enable. +1 to the team

Controls: Mouse. For more advanced/hardcore gamers, you can use keyboard keys.

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]
As a tower defense game, your goal is to prevent the bloons from exiting the map. If it does, your life will be deducted. Once you lose all of your life, the game ends. At this point, you can either replay from scratch or use monkey cash to re-try again. 

What makes BTD 6 complicated is the difficulty and what game mode you are playing on. A standard easy vs Deflation easy is 2 totally different game mode while they share the ""common"" easy rules. Same concept applies to the other difficulty/harder maps. 

On the surface it may seem like all the maps and bloons are the same. So, what exactly makes the game ""harder""?
The first criteria is the game mode which you are playing. It will set the tone on how hard/what sort of challenge you will be presented. (1 hp game, magicians tower only, reverse path, half cash etc)

The second criteria is the difficulty levels. On a general note, the higher difficulty you play, you will be required to play more levels. easy: 40 levels. medium 60. hard 80. you will encounter much harder bloon types (mix and match from various properties: camo, ceramic, metal, rainbow, regrow, FORTIFIED! etc). The bloon type is what dictates ""how hard the game"" will be. 

In order to beat hard maps, you will definitely need to max out your tower levels and invest into monkey knowledge. Heroes are not prominent until you start to play on hard maps or you have a particular way of playing/sync it with other towers.

The tower themselves are unique and depending on your style of play, you can mix and match certain tower styles. In this sense it gives flexibility to the players - some may opt of the ninja tower but others prefer the sniper. 

[h1]My personal thoughts/My Summary[/h1]
Bloon TD has come a long way. I wouldn't say BTD 6 has revolutionize tower defense games but it's certainly not your average tower defense. What makes it fun/challenging is the bloons. Knowing your enemy properties and spawn at which level will greatly increase the gameplay experience else its going to be bonkers.

40 over maps playing solo can feel repetitive and boring. On harder maps, where you are required to play 80 levels or more (more time spent) can be a turn off after xxx hours.

Going co-op, you will have to stick with the map layout and without a proper way to communicate, can turn the game into a messy monkey business. Spamming of emoticons that doesnt make sense. I dont voice chat unless i am playing with my friends. in other words, playing online with public you have to bare with the: 1) map layout (free for all or play in a section of the map), 2) communication limitation 3) knowledge of the person..and style of play
can lead to a [b][u]painful[/u][/b] experience. 

ever played in a co-op map where one of the player just build 1 tower in a hard game map? 
or leaves immediately once the game starts?
or mass tower hugging at the entrance? [b]vomits blood[/b]

On the other hand, if you are playing with knowledgeable people, you learn and have more fun. I wished there was a way to add them into your friend list. I would love to have more co-op maps that are free to play style than sections though.

So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Bloon TD 6 is a no-monkey business, creative coconut mess that is fun. An easy 8/10."

Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,It's alright.
Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"I want to start off this review by noting that I seldom played previous Bloons games apart from Bloons TD Battles. Due to this, as you can imagine, it was a little difficult to adapt to the games style in comparison to Battles, especially with the addition of heroes. However, this game has far surpassed all my expectations when I first purchased the game for only 99 cents. Despite thew extremely low cost, I have gotten an unprecedented amount of enjoyable gameplay, even in comparison to games that cost 20x as much. The gameplay is energetic, vibrant, and increasingly challenging in an incredibly fun way. The different monkeys all seem to be relatively balanced and the addition of three upgrade paths allows for an absurd amount of different unique play styles and setups. Every monkey has its own situational use you have to play the game to get more and more used to the different monkeys. The heroes mesh nicely with the game and the ranging difficulty of the maps allows for players to progress in skill at their own pace. On top of this, there are lots of cool community events and the game is even more of a blast when you play with friends. I would most certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and chill strategy game to play with your friends or solo."

This is just a comfy-as-heck game to unwind with and cap off a day. I've been playing one or two maps before bed and it's helped me get to sleep more easily. I'm sticking with Bloons TD for a while!"

Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"Bought this game to play with my wife and friends. Not only does it lag like crazy before we even get to round 100, it basically will make someone end up disconnecting or everyone before we could even hope to get to round 200. Making anyone lose any insta monkey or special perks such as the MONEY DROP one (special pre-upgraded monkeys that you can buy in menu as well). After playing this for almost 100 hours I can tell you this isn't worth. Unless they figure out a way to return ATLEAST some insta monkeys or special perks used this is unacceptable. Literally unplayable. (My wife and I have 1 Gig internet with good specs and my friends have very similar equipment in general)"

Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"This game ruined my marriage. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. I now have alcoholism, crippling depression, and an eating disorder. DO NOT BUY."
Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"It has been years since the balloon outbreak. no amounts of bloodshed, bullets, and fire could damage the ever expanding rubber empire. Humanity ended. As the universe moved on, the next evolution of life bloomed. Monkeys, after the abandonment of human technology, were able to advance their intellect and skills, sharpening their darts for the eventual conflict with their floating menace. A war brew, and soon will determine who will dominate the Earth once again."
Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"Bloons TD 6 is by far the best in the series. New heroes to pick from each with their own unique styles, i always enjoy trying them out for the first time and seeing how they change my playstyle for each level. New fun towers adding to the enjoyment and many hours i will get out of this game. Three upgrade paths for each monkey adding cool visuals and abilities to each monkey!!. The graphics are quite pleasing the best way i can describe it is kinda a 2.5D, The monkies all have a 3D look to them but with the same 2D map style of previous games. The game can be a bit grindy at times, trying to level all monkeys and get monkey knowledge/monkey money, but i havent felt like it was a boring grind yet. Overall this is one of if not my favourite games of the year. If you liked previous games in the franchise im sure you will love this one."

RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Full underground base, chemfuel stored in a granite room with no cables in the walls so I figured it was safe, a Zzzt event set a colonist on fire who fled into the chemfuel stockpile, the stockpile exploded destroying the wall between it and the hallway. 

The initial explosion was fairly well contained but the heat from the fire raised the temperature in the communal hall to several hundred degrees in about 15 seconds then all the furniture caught fire as well. there was nowhere for the heat to go and relatively little space to heat up so it turned the whole place into a furnace, even the coolers caught fire, then the food caught fire. The communal hall included all the hallways that went throughout my base (ironically to make temperature control easier) so there was no way to get out of the base other than to go through the communal hall. 

One dumbass died in the initial explosion, three caught fire in the halls before reaching the shelter of the adjacent rooms, those already in those rooms caught fire as they were dying of heatstroke, the communal hall reached over two thousand degrees Celsius.

There were no survivors.

RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"This game is the worst thing that's ever happened to my productivity. I love it anyways though. Buy it, but, my ADHD comrades, beware."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"oh lord, what have i done"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Alright, I took my time and I think I finally have a good grasp on my thoughts about this game. I'll try to keep them short and to-the-point.

This is one of those games I've spent quite a bit more hours in than I'd like to admit. Not because the game is bad or embarrassing or anything -- it's because I feel a little bit weird about having so many games collecting dust in my library and then never ""finding the time or energy"" to even boot them, but then I have titles like rimworld that I've somehow found that ""time and energy"" in abundance.

On the surface the game seems either casual or overly complex, depending on which stage of playing it you are currently in. Before buying this game, it seemed casual (likely attributed to the art style) and after I finally clocked my first hour in, I had to admit it seemed a bit too complex for a simple man like me.

This is, however, just a charade. The game is neither casual nor overly complex. The game is very nicely balanced in its complexity and the generally great (although not very aesthetically pleasing) GUI plays a big part in that. 

Now, my experience has been enhanced by mods from the very beginning. My very first (short-lived) playthrough was entirely vanilla, but as with most games, I quickly checked out the mods and just couldn't stop myself.

The best part of this game is the modding community and all the awesome mods that we've had the pleasure to play with and experience. And I'm not even exaggerating that. It's absolutely amazing how much variety and even very specific little things we have. And there's no lack of absolutely gigantic mods with entirely new, complex and well-balanced mechanics. This is one of those games that actually benefit greatly from mods, and it has been developed in a way to make this possible. This is a very mod-friendly title and that is always a complete treat.

Once you get a grasp on the mechanics and what the game is about, it's an endless hole to throw your time in. It's even worse than civ in this regard, even if civ has the iconic ""one more turn"" phrase attached to it. And I shouldn't use the word ""worse"" -- it is indeed better for it.

I've never managed to get anywhere close to building the ship that seems to be the ultimate goal for this game. But I've never even cared for ending the game honestly. All of my games, except for the first two more serious attempts, have been tribal starts with mods that make it a true ""start from the ancient times and slowly build up"" experience. I love the game in this form -- you start with barely enough technology to survive the first winter, and even if it is technically enough, it often turns out to be tricky to manage. The technologies advance so slow it plays no big part in this first huge problem/puzzle, though I'm not sure if I've always just had some mod that makes that harder than vanilla. But the point is -- I've never, to this day, gotten very far in the technology tree in a true tribal/""ancient"" start. And I've never felt like I've been missing out or bored waiting for the technology to advance. It's exactly to the contrary.

The thing is, and this is the downside for me, the game is so gripping and slow in pace (which is an amazing thing) that every time I try to commit to a playthrough and actually get somewhere, something else in my life happens and I can't touch the game for months. Coming back after that, there's always either the fact that some mods no longer work either together or with the base game, or I've completely forgot the entire story I had been building and no longer felt any connection to the save even if it did work after all that time. So I've always just started again and again and again.

And never have I been able to get very far.

Which is absolutely okay, for me anyway. The most fulfilling part of the game in my opinion is the beginning. You get to know the characters, their quirks, you carefully fine-tune the work priorities, the daily schedules, select a spot for the colony and just start living it, slowly building atop each small achievement or milestone. It's a very intriguing combination of planning, building, honing and expanding on all of those iteratively, decision after decision.

And it's just a very gripping, fulfilling experience. More so than most games that I can think of.

This is a game that doesn't look like much, if you're used to triple-A level of graphics and UI. But the game itself is full of soul, full of possibilities and full of moments that'll make you feel something.

It's a game I would whole-heartedly suggest everyone sees for themselves. This might just be a game-changer for you too. Even if it isn't, I doubt you'll feel cheated of your time after you try it out. I'd even go as far as bet that you'll absolutely love it even if it doesn't stick."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"So, first review ever so I will keep it as short and to the point I can. 

Great game, addicting as hell and the fact that I got over 1000+ hours in the game in under a year should point to that. Mods just add more to the game and most of them are great and some are must haves. 11/10 would buy again.

What follows are semi coherent ramblings about the game, read at your own peril.

[spoiler]

Rimworld is infinitely replayable. You start with several scenarios that give you a varying amount of ""pawns"" (your slaves to do with you want), techlevels and resources. You can generate planets and modify said generation making planets tropical paradises, hellish deserts or frozen wastelands. When you get tired of the basic scenarios you can also make your own. Want your pawn(s) to start a drug addict and fight for survival while going through withdrawal? You can do that. Want your pawn(s) to be bionic super soldiers hell bent on destroying the planet.... that is possible too. You can play as wanderers or colonists or a mixture of both styles. And with the dev tools available ingame you can easily modify the game while you play it, putting even more chaos into the mix. You can do everything from spawning new pawns, animals and so on, to changing the weather, to making the map a peaceful paradise...... (sorry, the warcriminal in me cringed a bit).

Obviously you can play on peaceful and turn it into a game of building and designing colonies or to exploring the world. Or you can play on the highest difficulty with ironman enabled to challenge your skill, your nerves and most importantly: your luck. Here once again Rimworlds easy customizability comes into play, permitting you to tailor the difficulty to your prefered playstyle, even mid game. And once you get tired (not that that is possible) of the game, you can istall mods to change everything or very little. New species, more animals, better interfaces (RimHud be praised), new weapons, rebalances for practically everything in the game and mods that totally change the game or the setting.
Rimworld as I now understand it, is about making a story, about leading your pawns as good as you can so they might survive another day (or torturing them into insanity, turning them into drug addicts and cold blooded murders or harvesting their organs one by one). As one of the tooltips of the game says ""A destroyed colony is not a failure, it is a tradegy"" (didnt look it up so it probably isnt 100% accurate).

As you play all pawns (on the map) interact socially and build relationships and connections. Those relationships then influence their interactions and what they think of the others. These interactions as other interactions with the world influence their happiness (mood) which can, when it falls below a certain threshold, lead to mental breaks. These mental breaks are varied and can go from aimless wandering to muderous rage where the pawn wont stop until their target is dead or the are killed (or arrested). 


I wont go into the carfting, building or research but suffice to say there are many options to pick from, many choices to be made when crafting or building and plenty of research to be researched.

All these interactions give flavor to the the world and it inhabitants. It can happen that a family member of one of your pawns comes and visits you, peacefully or with the intention of destroying everything you have. Out of these interactions a story is crafted. (A certain mod makes these interactions more visible by giving your pawns speachbubbles so you can easily read how they interact.)
After I figured this out I stopped building absurd over the top bases and instead focused more on my pawns and fullfilling their needs and seeing how they interact. Back then I tended to have my speed at x3 so stuff got built faster, which lead to me missing practically all interactions and only being able to see the consequences. I now play on x1 most of the time and watch them go about their work, chatting, flirting or insulting the pawns they pass or share work space with. It is far more engaging then playing it as a rts or something similiar.

And the Royalty DLC adds many new things and several new playstyles
So yeah, worth every cent. This game gave me the best money to time spent ratio of all my games
Randy Random/10 would play again
 
[/spoiler]"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Yeah, okay, this reluctant reviewer will pen one for this incredible masterpiece quality work of art.

First of all, if you're waiting for a sale, don't. It never goes on sale (I've seen it on sale once, at the time of this reviewing, for 10%, so don't shop around.) and it's worth giving the developer your money. I even bought the DLC (when I had heard many of the DLC features were either better done in mods or not really that great of an addition) to support the developer, because holy shit, this was my favourite game for a long time.

Secondly, do you remember Firefly? That old Sci Fi/Space Western with only one season, Nathan Filion and the hot wife from Deadpool? That's what this game is VERY loosely based on. You crash land on a planet (which you get to choose where on the planet to crash lmao great realism) and your handful of starting colonists start building a base (or they starve to death or get murdered, you don't have to be good at this game) and you basically explore your own long term interests.

This is a sandbox game that isn't boring. You know how in some games like Factorio you have to set your own goals? Well, that's not explicitly *required* for this game. You can just react to things that happen to you. Random events, both good, bad, and neutral, will happen on a semi-predetermined basis based on the Storyteller you've chosen (which you can change at any time in the pause menu). You can choose between the one that escalates difficulty based on how complex/wealthy your base is (if you want the random events to be scaled off how well you're doing), the one that gives you a LOT of time between events (if you want a really chill experience where you can just farm and build and craft things and tame animals and become a business enterprise), and the one who is COMPLETELY random and will just throw chaos at you at every opportunity. 

Further divided, these Storytellers can be set to various difficulty levels, so you can have the Chill Storyteller on hardest difficulty and each random event will potentially obliterate your base, but there'll be plenty of time between them, or you could set Random Storyteller on easiest difficulty and have really weird things happen to you over and over again without really challenging your defences.

Now, what I mean by random events is, like, really quite complex and varied. Manhunting packs of animals (from labradors to goats to megasloths to elephants to rhinos), raids from other towns and villages and tribes and pirates who live elsewhere on the planet, trading caravans who hang around and try to trade with you so you can sell shit you accumulated or buy the shit they brought to sell you, even groups of tamed animals that just show up and want to join your colony because they're lonely or whatever. Oh, yeah, remember mimics? those chests in RPG games that aren't chests, they're actually monsters waiting for you to come close and get mauled? Human and animal versions of those occasionally show up and join, too. Have fun with those.

Now, one thing a lot of people are ALWAYS surprised about this game is just how DEEP these interactions and random events can be. Like, you get spoiled for complexity in this game. This game made me realize how shallow and repetitive so many other games are. They promise immersion and replay value and such, but it's just the same gameplay experience slightly harder. Even Dark Souls, like, if you only play with a sword and shield over and over, it gets boring fast, but if you play with a halberd or punching gloves, you can have more replay value, because you're playing under constraints, or trying to play the game differently. Rimworld is the same with this, but it's WAY more than just ""Oh, I'll play it this different way."" you can straight up decide how you want your base to be. You want to be an organ-harvesting nightmare compound that skins captured enemy prisoners and unlucky crashlanded humans, harvests their hearts and lungs and brains and tans their skin into leather, makes them into hats and jackets and sells them to passing orbital trade ships, you can do it. You want to be a zoo where you have dozens of different animals all living in harmony with humans and everyone's vegan and nobody eats meat, you can do it. You want to have a chill bachelor pad where your colonists hang around with tamed foxes, smoking weed and doing cocaine and watching megascreen television and playing poker until the enemy comes knocking and then they ride their majestic rhinoceros into battle with miniguns, obliterating anyone stupid enough to try and take your shit? Go for it.

This is all just in the base game (except riding animals, I think), and now let's address the modding situation. This is quite possibly the BEST modded game I have ever played in my life. I don't think I'd ever be able to go back to the base game, simply because the mods just add SO MUCH VARIETY. You can get the aforementioned riding animals mod, animal armour mod, Alpha Animals mod which adds hundreds of new kinds of animals into the game, dozens of different military equipment mods giving you incredible new amounts of guns, armour, support equipment, fashion mods that give you a bunch of different clothes your colonists can make, carpet mods allowing you to turn any kind of textile (cloth, mushroom fibre, animal wool, animal skin) into carpet and wallpaper, so in that organ-harvesting colony I mentioned before, you can have carpet and wallpaper made from human skin. Find THAT in another game. There's a lot of different mining and factory and medical mods, too, giving you access to oil-processing, so you can drill for oil then refine it into plastic and other materials to use as construction materials or fuel. Medical-wise, you can have genetic engineering mods, prosthetic/bionic mods, so if anyone suffers a permanent injury (yeah colonists can get eyes shot out and limbs torn off in the base game) you can grow a natural replacement to give to them, or just embrace your futuristic destiny and craft a bunch of advanced bionic prosthetics that allow your colonists to become cyborgs (some colonists hate this because they're body purists who want natural bodies, but other colonists LOVE this deal, and can't wait to get their advanced bionic limbs).

You can also make bionics and prosthetics for animals. Your favourite tamed timber wolf got his spine shot out and now he's quadriplegic? Just make him a bionic spine. Hell, give him some bionic eyes and bionic jaw while you're at it, now when he attacks enemies (as you can train him to do) he can devastate them way better.

Tamed timber wolf cyborgs that you can use to defend your futuristic weed farm?

Just buy the goddamn game already. Why are you still reading this shit? Trust me when I say this is one of the best games of all time and I utterly PRAY that other developers and game makers would take some pointers from how this game is made and incorporate some of the foundational gameplay principles into their own ethos.



tl;dr buy the best colony simulation game ever made."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"I LOVE this game. I love it so much that I recommend it to everyone... and yet, this game consistently stays at over $30. Nobody's gonna buy it for $31.49. Come on, guys :("

RimWorld,Strategy,294100,dobra hra mam zatím 100h a zatím furt baví :D
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"bought the game, played literally the entire day and then passed out for 15 hours"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Very enjoyable game. Lots of mod support that add additional features that add more variety to the base game. Completing the game is its own challenge, but there are a number of ways to play this that don't involve ""completing the game"" that add to the overall enjoyment. Very easy to become ""attached"" to your pawns like in X-com series. Keeping them alive while playing ""your"" way, is extremely challenging."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Probably one of the better town managment games in my library. Can be slow but with time and the will to survive you too can take over your rim world. Just get out there, oh and never trust Randy."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Organ selling is my favorite past-time. At least 50 hours.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"To be honest it is a really good game for its price, even more so with the mods the awesome fanbase makes!"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,its pretty fun
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,is great
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"when yes and then you yeah, you know? its really fun when you do that, especially with multiplayer mod."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"it's okay, keeps you busy for a bit"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Made a colony of cannibals. That's it. What?

RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"So many mods....
so many dead pawns....
so many Raids...
so many Thrumbos....
so many mechinoids...
so many drugs...
"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"I was skeptical that i would like this game. tried it  just fell in love with this colony sim. Now The way ""random"" events play out. I Just promised a new recruit safety right before I was raided by a handful of raiders. Wasted them all, and in the middle of recovering two rival factions show up and use my bridge as their battlefield. (24 folks?) bridge on fire and ended up defending my base from one faction to helping the other faction by rescuing their few survivors. You know that new recruit? he had a mental break down and fell over due to a heart attack. Did i mention he was 84 years old? yeah.."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,I have over 2900 hours played in this game and I'm still not very good at it.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,It's terrible
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"A great game with a great design and an awesome modding community. Insta fav, tons of my nerves i'm never getting back and 1200+ hours spent without any sliver of regret. 
Try it, it's well worth it!"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,quarter of a way thought the tutorial
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"This game have every thing you need for a managerial simulator. the game learning curve is rather easy yet hard to master. Oh, did i mention the mods that has done by this amazing community. It will fullfill almost all your wish in a managerial type of game."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"What makes this game special is that every playthrough is unique. You can approach the game with many different ways. You may need to invest a good amount of time to be decent at playing, but I'm pretty sure that you won't be regretting afterwards. Moding may also change many aspects of the game and may require additional effort to understand. So you need to know what you actually want with mods. That's why what I suggest is that you must learn vanilla itself before you consider implementing mods."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,one of the best games ever made
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Much better with mods but still base game is a fun time
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,If you thought Dwarf fortress was to hard you can play an easier version here
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Hundreds of hours of content in this game and if id doesn't have a feature that you would like there's probally a mod for it.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Worth the money ^_^
10/10"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Well, so far it is not a complete replacement for Dwarf Fortress.... but it sure as hell stands on its own two feet and scratches the same itch... and with a lot more friendly user interface."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"It's like drugs, but cheaper."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"This is one of the greatest games I have ever been addicted too.
It is the best space survival colony game I have played, and I am massively into the survival/colony/RTS genre. 
Every play through is varied and you can completely select the difficulty/challenge that suits you. Along with selecting any type of biome on a planet, and then pack up and move the next day if you do not like it! 
You make connections with your colonists, when they die it is almost heart breaking (or even worse when they have a bad day and pack up and leave... thats where I get the other colonists to arrest them and force them to stay :P no one escapes my colonies haha). I get to know my colonists well, and see them become more happy with the colony as it improves/survives, see their skills develop, relationships grow stronger and fall apart, marriages, divorces, people who used to be enemies who I have captured and integrated into my colony. It is intricate and fascinating.
The depth that this game goes into is incredible, and there is so much to keep you invested in this game for hours in one play-through! However at the same time it is very easy to get the grip of the game and understand its mechanics.
If you do not own it, and you like space colony/builder games, get this! NOW!"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"very addicting more addicting then mcdonald chicken nuggets
"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,rimworld is sex
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Its okay. I would recommend Rimworld as it certainly does have a good gameplay loop and does suck you in at first. The price is a bit steep but its probably worth it if you like these kinds of games.

However, there a certain part of Rimworld that utterly ruin the game for me. First and foremost: the combat. Pawns will be attacked by a rat, miss every shot, then when the rat eventually reaches them, they will stop shooting and either do nothing and die or melee attack the rat to death (despite the fact that they have a gun). This makes certain, ""highly valued"", and ""powerful"" weapons absolutely useless. Why would you ever use a sniper rifle when your pawns will miss every shot and then die.

The devs also make a point to explain that the game is a story generator and is sometimes not winnable. In my opinion the story that is generated isn't very memorable or interesting. Some wacky or sad or funny things happen but its overshadowed by the fact that these things will result in your colony, which you may have spent 10s of hours building, dying. A lot of the world also doesn't make sense. You will land on a planet that has a few factions that basically control the whole planet. Some of these factions are tribes that use bows and arrows and don't wear clothes. Somehow these primitive tribes are able to maintain bases across a huge planet and communicate with each other (mostly communicate their hatred of your colony btw).

That being said i think the lore/world building is really good. Personally, i really like all the descriptions of animals, weapons, and building materials."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Warning, you should not play this game. It is too good. And that's why I just broke 1000 hours."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"This is one of those games that are hard to pick up, but infinitely harder to put down. So many incredible stories can come out of this game dynamically as you play that you will never forget it. If you are looking for one of those games that gobbles up your weekend in the blink of an eye and makes you really wish there was more time in your day, this is it. I could go over all the details of why this game is so highly rated, but to someone who hasnt played, its all pointless, it needs to be experienced.

"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,I skin people.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Don't get caught in the OCD restart trap. Just roll with the punches.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"This game is amazing. The more you play it the better it gets. Hands down one of the top 5 games I have played, ever."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"A game that is easy to invest a lot of time into without realizing. The base game is good, but adding the many mods available with it makes the game great. Just make sure to get some sleep while playing."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Please just get me addicted to crack cocain instead
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"thought it could be interesting to see what happens when I have only one colonist capable of violence. 3 naked tribespeople with clubs invaded, ganged up on her before she could gun them down, beat her and one other colonist into unconsciousness and kidnapped them, leaving only her husband to save their dog's life, tend the fields and feed the alpacas. the dog died from wounds sustained trying to defend her master and the colonist went insane, set his bedroom on fire, and died in the ensuing blaze.

11/10 game, immediately bought the DLC and started another colony"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,I enslaved a tribal woman and used her as a human generator by keep artificially impregnating her. 10/10 game.

RimWorld,Strategy,294100,really fun game totaly rec
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Great game, took a little bit for me to get into it but once I did I was hooked"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Zajebała mnie szynszyla dobra gra 
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,I have never had so much fun playing a game im so terrible at. Mod the piss out of it <3
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"It's difficult to concisely explain the experience that RimWorld is. I could say it's an organization sim, but that feels hollow. I can say it's a story-telling sim, but that feels too surface-level. Perhaps the best way to describe it is that: it's one of those games that you start playing in the morning, and the next time you look up from your computer screen it's well past midnight, and you've unknowingly sunken a day into it. It's amazingly captivating. The story-telling, the building of your colony, the forging forward on quests -- I can guarantee you, you'll never feel ""at rest"" or ""at ease"" playing this game. There is always more to do. I have 65 hours logged thus far and I [i]don't even have electricity yet[/i].

RimWorld's ""fault"", so to speak, comes through a few small mechanics that I'll be outlining below. 

The first is the UI. It's atrocious and not even mildly intuitive. Trading feels like doing sudoku. You [i]will[/i] struggle with the UI -- at the very least at the beginning, or perhaps through the entire thing. Nothing is ordered in an intuitive matter. It's not alphabetical order, or order that you'd build it, or order of importance. It's hard to explain how bad the UI is until you're in the game, but I can guarantee it is frustrating and can sometimes be a hindrance. Luckily, you can pause the game infinitely as you work it out and finally do what you need it to. 

The second is its uniqueness -- and yes, this can occasionally be a fault to RimWorld! There's truly no game completely like RimWorld. People will compare it to Prison Architect, and that's true enough, but there are so many unique mechanics that it will take even seasoned gamers time to adjust. It doesn't help that the UI is so chaotic. As if you were, too, stranded and building a civilization from nothing, you will be learning on the fly, so to speak, in the beginning. 

And the third is its difficulty. You'll see on one of the loading screens that RimWorld is ""a story generator, not a skill test. A ruined colony is a dramatic tragedy, not a failure."" Such a sweet sentiment... but it doesn't help when there [i]is[/i] a dramatic failure. You get attached to your characters, your story, and even your whole base, and this game is... unforgiving. Literally playing on even the easiest storyteller has constant disasters your way. It can be a bit of a nightmare. So just remember to save frequently -- you never know when going back will save your bacon! 

All in all, it's an amazing game. Play the way you wish and enjoy it, but most definitely give it a glance."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,W A R   C R I M E S
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"So I was on the fence with this one. I'm a simple person. I like simple controls.  I like things that don't make my brain hurt trying to remember controls or how to do something simple like mine a whole lot all at once (this is seriously learned within the first 5 minutes of the tutorial and I couldn't remember it. I had to google it.). So I seriously was thinking it would be too much for my simplistic mind to remember. I also thought it would be too hard to play with all the random attacks and such. 

But, I love this game. I have played 47 hours at the time of this review. First thing, you can change different settings to make things to your liking (I made it peaceful, so I could concentrate on learning the controls and building a base, as well as figure out how to get more colonists, because I was struggling with that.) and basically customize your game play to exactly your speed.

This game sucked me in, and I honestly can't understand how I got 47 hours into it already. I find this game fun and chill and its a great way to unwind. Again, I'm just playing a more peaceful world, and considering one of my first villagers died to a guinea pig attack, I think this game can get brutal if that is what you are looking for."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"I tried to come up something funny but I'm just amazed by how good this game is. Simple graphics but that doesn't stop you from enjoying the game. One of the best colony simulators I've ever played. It's good, buy it!"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Ate without table: -3

Played Rimworld: +20"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"This is a unique and genius game with endless opportunities for modding and creativity. I will definitely come back to it again as more content is added, which seems to be pretty regularly."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"I play this game pretty much whenever I have free time, and it's wonderful. It has made me very angry but it's just one of those games. Also my friends think it's pretty funny when in the middle of perfect silence in our Discord call, I screech because one of my colonists died in the dumbest way possible.

The modding community is fantastic, but just vanilla satisfied me for a while. I DO heavily recommend mods as they make the game a whole new level, but you can get a lot of fun out of vanilla. I think my first 100 hrs or so were mostly vanilla (perhaps some vanilla expanded mods, which are so well integrated that it barely feels like mods).

The time to kill might bore some people, but that could be said for a lot of colony sims / base builders. I love this game and continue to find more and more to play with through the use of the mods that the amazing community has built.

NOTE: Perhaps think how willing you are to commit warcrimes before investing in this game. I know it's a meme, but warcrimes are literally the biggest draw of this game for a lot of people. I'm one of the rare people who try to make colonists with morals, but sometimes you still gotta tip your toes in a little. I mean, they were about to die anyways, it's selfish to take their perfectly good organs to the grave with them. Sharing is caring."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"THIS GAME IS FKIN AMAZING
Seriously, the workshop even makes it better"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"As close as anything has gotten to recreating the unique magic that is Dwarf Fortress. That paired with a bit of The Sims and great modding support, and you get a fantastic experience filled with great stories to be had for roleplayers that enjoy simulation games. Highly recommended."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,A fun little world builder type game. Graphics are more than dwarf fort but still low key enough to run on a calculator basically. The story teller AI does a good job between them based on how you want the game to go. A really good game for putting a lot of low impact hours into.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,You can sell organs.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,10/10 will harvest organs again
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"My colonist got a mental breakdown so he decided to punched incready shells. He blew himself up and the fire destroyed half of my base including food supplies. Then the animals drank all remaining alcohol that survived the fire and started attacking my colonists. After that I got raided.
Best experience I've ever got. 12 ""Ate without table"" out of 10"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"I remember the demise of my first colony over 1100 hours ago, and every colony since.

Only game I enjoy losing."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"I was iffy about this game because of the graphics, but ended up loving how many things can happen and the depth of everything. The mods add tons of content and twitch intergration. Letting chat go crazy and bring pawns into the game make this a blast to stream. Just playing solo is amazing too and the story teller events keep things very challenging and interesting. Game is replayable and very unique."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Very Good
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Gimme ur organs.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,A masterpiece!  Nothing else to say.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"I have done... terrible things... crimes against humanity that would make himmler turn away in disgust. I have created colonies full of cyborgs and androids who reject the flesh and harvest all unlucky enough to come my way to sell their organs and butcher their meat and turn their skin to leather. 

its true, this game... it turns you into a monster. 

10/10, could not reccommend more. 

also the game size is so small that even if you brick your game, deleting and re-downloading it can be done in like 5 minutes on any halfway decent connection."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"RimWorld is a lot of fun, very detailed, easy to get lost in.  A combination of SimCity, Wasteland, and Banished. If you liked those games, you'll definitely like this one.  Royal DLC is quite a nice touch."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"I just want to give this game a thumb up, everything about it has been said already. Go make yourself a favor and buy it."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Where do I start...

Rimworld is a [strike] game, [/strike] [strike] experience, [/strike] [strike] colony builder, [/strike]. Rimworld is something different when it comes to gameplay. It can have this relaxed tone and setting behind it with a wonderful score to back its atmosphere. While at the same time providing a sense of tension at every battle. You are in control of colonists who have crash landed onto a, [i] you guessed it, [/i] rimworld, a planet on the edge of inhabited space. There you are placed, with only a few necessities for survival and are tasked to keep your colonists alive while also finding a way off this rock. 
That's what you hope will happen at least.

After playing for the first time you will most likely lose a lot of people you might grow attached to. Every one of the colonists you are in control of each have their own attributes and backstories which they build on during the game. This can include relationships with other colonists, tribes and enemies. Losing several limbs while fighting. Dying of an infection then being frozen after death and, years later, being brought back from the dead, seeing that the colony of three which they had started with, was now a bustling town of 20.
All of these small stories build off one another, teaching the player how to succeed on the rim. You will learn the best ways to start off, what to focus on to survive and what traits you value for your colonists. Want somebody who loves the taste of human flesh and is fine with blood? You can have that! And sometimes it will be necessary to make a decision on which of your people will need to be sacrificed to keep everyone else alive.

That is the goal in the end. To stay alive, at all costs.

I love Rimworld, not just because it's a canvas where you can let all of the war-crimes you've ever wanted to commit, actually come to fruition, but because it's a journey you are brought on, one in which both the little things as well as the world changing ones all seem to make a difference.
If you liked games such as dwarf fortress, but couldn't get over the text-based nature of it and also love the futuristic genre. Then this game will be right up your alley!"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,The only way they could improve this game would be to add multiplayer.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"I once removed all the organs possible to take out without killing them, then sold them as a slave.

overall 10/10"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,if you were a victim of warcrimes growing up this will give you some catharsis by being on the other end
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"If you can't wait for the user-friendly version Dwarf Fortress there's nothing that scratches the itch much better than RimWorld. 

You start out as a group of survivors trying to survive as they crash land on a planet in the middle of nowhere.  RimWorld takes a ""the real treasure was the friends we made along the way"" approach to gameplay so getting off the planet is completely optional. It sells itself as a story generator, putting more emphasis on your struggle to achieve whatever your personal in-game goals are, be they organ farms, petting zoos, or actually playing the objective if you're a psycho. If you're not careful your story might instead end with you bleeding to death because a [i]horse somehow bit your leg off[/i].

It has a tutorial so you won't be too overwhelmed when starting out. I recommend going in blind anyway.  If that's not your cup of tea there are different difficulties which caters to casuals, masochists, and everyone in between. The vanilla gameplay gets repetitive once you put in a lot of hours, but thankfully that's nothing a few (or several hundred) mods can't fix."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,It's pretty fun
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Kept me entertained for a few hours. Can recommend.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Great game that looks like poop.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,This game makes me mad. Buy it.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,everyone's got a job to do at the rim
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,It's okay
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"I havent actually played the game yet, i been downloading mods and spend most of my day trying to get them to work with each other. 10/10  I might actually play the game one day"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Yes its very good

Age of Empires II (2013),Strategy,221380,"Actually runs AoE2 as expected, unlike the newer ""definitive edition"" which takes up 10x as much hard drive space to play the same exact game, and routinely crashes on me.  Definitive edition also has a bunch of UI updates and ""quality of life"" changes that make the game less like the original, which to be honest I didn't feel were needed.  In my opinion, AoE2 HD is the best version of this game - it brings it up to date for newer PC's while staying true to the original without the completely unnecessary bloated design changes of the definitive edition."

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition,Strategy,813780,"It's been a great game but due to the latest patch which involves the most recent dlc, the FPS rate has dropped incredibly during the gameplay. Until the fps is fixed I'll need to take a break from playing until then."

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition,Strategy,813780,"This is the seminal RTS game, fighting and conquering the other civs.  They get just about everything right and are still actively developing the game adding more civs and tech, special units with unique powers.  You can spend hours and hours honing your skills and still have more to discover.  Very engaging especially with a group of friends against each other or against the AI.  The HD AI is really tough, its a challenge."

Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Please remove the launcher and stop harvesting my data after I have already paid you.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Yes, not time consuming at all and doesn't ruin sleeping schedules"

I (and several other players) find this completely unreasonable, being a breach of user privacy. Will not be buying anything from Firaxis or 2k until this is removed."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Just play Civ 5. It is a much better game imo. Simple, fun, easy to get into but can be mastered with practice. This game has nothing going for it. The art style of the game is too cartoonish, the gameplay has a lot of content but little to no depth in most of the choices you make. The same base civ concepts are great because they are just the same thing from Civ 5. I find this game to be more tedious and more boring, I felt like there was too much unnecessary additions and goals added to the game. On top of that, just doing the bare minimum essentials to try and succeed in the standard game is a chore every few turns. I like being nervous every once and a while in Civ wether its barbarians or an actual war on my hands but I do not enjoy the amount of stress that you have to manage in this game. Like I said in the beginning of this review, If you have not played any Civ games and are considering this one to be your first, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS. BUY CIVILIZATION 5"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Being forced to buy the DLC at full retail price, while other users can purchase it at 77% off is stupid. 

Even if i remove the product from my steam account it will block any attempt to re-purchase at the offer price. 

No way am i going to pay over £150 for DLC content when i can create a brand new account and buy a 77% off bundle for £41. 

Stupid and anti consumer."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"The game itsself is good, but my god they absolutely ruined it with their awful awful launcher. I don't see why game devs like to shoot themselves in the foot just to have their special little launcher. It crashes constantly now, when before i could run giant oversized maps with no issues whatsoever. Please 2k give up on your launcher. Nobody likes it. Nobody wants it. It doesn't do anything to add to the experience. It just ruins it"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"When compared to Civ V, this one is much better looking. Not just the graphics, but the menus as well, it's all more functional. Most of the changes are upgrades, to be honest."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Latest forced update caused major issues that I know have to uninstall and reinstall and I will lose all my saved files. Steam does nothing now but say they are just a place to buy and sell games offers no support and says I have to deal with 2K which I now have to create a 2K profile to get help with them. They are also no help saying its a known issue and have to just try to uninstall and reinstall and lose my stuff. So no help there and no longer purchasing through steam since they have become a pointless middle man.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,2k Launcher has made it impossible to open the game. Do not buy it.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Personally, I like CIV 6. Objectively speaking, it would be hard to recommend this game.

The CIV series was always one of my favorite strategy games. Building up your civilization from one tiny city to a world-spanning empire was and will always be fun.

Let's get the big negative out of the way. The 2K Launcher.
Which got inspired by the 4X genre. Explore, expand, exploit, exterminate.
2K explored new ways to annoy players. They expanded by introducing a new client. They exploit their player base by forcing this wreck on us. Finally, they exterminated any fun and positive reviews with it.

With that out of the way, let's get to a more detailed review.

CIV 6's aesthetics are a nice breath of fresh air and fit the game very well. Some people might prefer more realistic-looking graphics but I really like the new look.
The soundtrack is pretty solid as always, nothing to complain about there.
Sean Bean as the narrator did an amazing job, although the quotes are a bit weird sometimes. Definitely could have picked better ones for some techs, wonders and civics.

Now for the most important part, the gameplay.
CIV 6 is more casual than other titles. Every civ has its specific strengths that make them more suitable for certain builds. But you can play them pretty much however you want, at least in singleplayer. It is not a challenging or complex game and most difficulties will stem from RNG than anything else. You at least need the Rise & Fall and Gathering storm expansions, vanilla CIV 6 is way too barebone and offers little to no variety in gameplay.
Whenever I finish a singleplayer session with a civ, I always have to take a break, simply because it gets boring and repetitive after some time. You start to dominate the map way too soon and there is not a lot going on, even on higher difficulties. Emperor is probably the sweet spot for fun, Immortal and Deity can be very annoying sometimes."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I enjoyed this game while I could play it, but the new launcher broke it beyond playability and it crashes sometimes just sitting for a few minutes at the main menu. Wish Firaxis would fix the problems."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"My favorite game series since I was a kid on Civilization II but what did they do to this poor game? It seems like a recent update crashes the game and they never fixed the world builder (i.e. you can't use start locations). New features are steering away from realism. A history game with Zombies? That doesn't sit right with me. I would love to see more historical scenarios but firaxis isn't expanding on them anymore. 

From the start, Civilization VI felt outbalanced. District adjacencies will cause a player to massively outpace others. It isn't normal that I find myself with aircrafts and my buddies with swordsmen despite playing on different difficulty levels. The art is terrible with this mobile game feel to it but at least there are mods for that.

I'm waiting for a Civilization VII and I'm hoping they correct course and go back to what I loved about this game. Otherwise, I think I'll stick with their competitors like Paradox (Crusader Kings, Hearts of Iron) or Amplitude (Endless legends, Humankind)."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I love this game and have purchased a number of expansions for it.

For some reason its publisher, 2K games added a launcher in an update. What does this do? It sells you DLC, it ruins your mods, and it messed up graphics options on my PC.  

While I would recommend this game, I cannot recommend this publisher. Please wait until they move on to another product before purchasing."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I got a notification that Civilization 6 will collect my data and ship it to other countries that may not have the same level of privacy collection.

I uninstalled the game right then and there, too bad I can't get a refund."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Was the game great ? I may never know.  Is 2K  the Problem or just the hours that it will take to fix this Joke of a update. Until they fix it I would suggest A Thumbs Down Review. Remember Steam is stuck just like we are so leave a thumbs down at 2K and firaxis . They are the cause of this.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I've been playing this game from the very beginning. Its had some downs in the past with certain bugs/balance changes and sometimes the DLC model is a bit pricey, but all in all it was a fun experience. Until the most recent update completely broke the game. 

The final game update has been causing all sorts of problems for players across the board, from crashing and performance issues to broken maps and content: True Start Location (TSL) are busted for many players, some game mode combinations cause the game to crash during loading, map generation can get stuck in a infinite loop, and some people can't even get into the game at all.

On top of having Civ 6's final update falling flat on its face, 2K has decided to implement a brand new launcher. Feature complete with always on DRM for paying customers convenience, causing no end of stability and performance issues both in the launcher and in-game (if you can even get the game to load).

It hurts to ""not recommend"" Civ 6 after getting so much enjoyment out of it, but in its current state I can't. QA should have caught these bugs long before this update was pushed out, and 2K should seriously reconsider its launcher and DRM policies considering how negatively they effect their paying customers."

Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"What the hell is wrong with you?  Why would you take a fantastic game and make it unplayable?  1300+ hours in, game now crashes with launcher.  GARBAGE"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Released an update to fix the bug that users can start the game through the launcher!
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Takes too long to load. For lovers of the original CIv games this is a step back.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I have played this game for many years without problems. And still love it.
But, after 2K unnecessary added the 2K Launcher the game, it crashes constantly. 
Never had problems before now
They ""destroyed"" the game and it is now unplayable. It's incredible that they ruin their own games with such nonsense.

Game is broken"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I WANT to enjoy this game, but as I exclusively play via online multiplayer and the game consistently crashes with the dreaded message ""EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION Error"" around turn 300, the game becomes literally unplayable. There is now (as of this writing) a 19-page thread on Steam regarding this issue with no solution in sight. Bottom line is the game is as buggy as a locus swarm - spend your money elsewhere!"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Bad. i hate the graphics. They are like cartoons. Looks not serious and real. I just can""t play after 30 min. I have 7K hours CIV 5 by the way. if you want to play Civilization play Civ 5 instead of this. Terrible."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Idk why but the game doesn't launch, because of that I have to play the game in my crappy mac instead of my gaming pc. Pls fix the 2k launcher."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,It was a great game and have many hours on it and enjoy every minute of it. I say 'was a great game' because since you put the launcher in I can no longer play it and all the troubleshooting I have searched does not work. PLEASE GET RID OF THE 2K LAUNCHER so I can have one...more...turn
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"they say games like these are good for your brain. and i will admit, it helped my memory. after playing this game, I've memorized every windows crash message and error there is.

fuck 2K, fuck CIV 6, get another game"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,dlc can break game and you unable to play it. happen to me
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"This game was programmed by a chimpanzee as a test to see how fast a program can crash your entire computer.

But seriously, the game itself is meh, a few well needed quality of play improvements over Civ V. HOWEVER anything good about this game is completely dwarfed by crashing your entire system EVERY SINGLE PLAY and the greedy removal of almost every civ and repackaging them into PAID DLC. You WILL get at least 1 or 2 of the same civs in every game unless you wanna pay.  Its also insanely slow to load and instead of just clicking play and playing the game it opens the 2K games launcher so you can click play a second time to actually play the game, making it take EVEN LONGER. NOBODY WANTS TO USE YOUR GARBAGE THIRD PARTY LAUNCHERS, STOP DOING THIS YOU IDIOT DEVS. 

Get Civ V instead."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,cool nuking game
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"If you like Civilization 5, this is nothing like it I regret spending over $60 on this game and it's to late to refund."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"The only reason I'm putting this review up is to warn people. This game used to work.

The launcher update has affected people quite drastically, myself included. The game now freezes consistently and is nigh unplayable. Don't even get me started on trying to play with a friend, the constant desync every few turns as well as the freezing is ridiculous. 

Don't buy this game until they remove the completely unnecessary launcher. I'm so, so disappointed they've gone this way. I love civ, but this has killed it."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Another good Civ game here. Though the more expansions you get the more micro-managery it becomes.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Hard pass. The game is brilliant - the 2K loader completely ruins the play experience. Before the 2K loader Civ worked; after the loader it fails to boot two times in three and routinely crashes halfway through a turn.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"The quality of work put into most games these days is next to zero, and this game is no exception. Latest update has caused extreme optimization issues/performance spikes for me. 

I run and i5-10700f, 1660ti, and 32 gigs of ram, yet now upon startup my cpu is spiking from norm of 37% to 85%/ Gpu spikes from 51% avg to 100%/ Vram spikes to 100%/ and my ram spikes to 70%. 

What the actual fuck have you pathetic excuses for developers screwed up now? Quit giving this game updates if all you're going to do is hinder your customer base and prevent them from using your product due to your failure as developers.

On a side note, what the fuck is this launcher for? you need an excuse to put some kind of back-door program on our devices and used a launcher as a means to weezle it in there?"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I'm hesitant to give this game a negative review. It's not as if it is bad. It's a good game but bad in comparison with CIV5
If you can get it on sale, I still recommend it. I started playing with CIV4 around 2006. So about 15 years experience. 
However, I would not but CIV6 or the DLC full price and that is how I must conduct my review even though it is not a bad game.
Simply put, Civilization 5 is better.
I'm just going to comment on a couple reasons why this game doesn't hold me like Civ5 did.
Civ 6 has some cool additions but loses a lot of what made Civ5 great.
First let's start at the art.
It's ugly. The governors look like cartoon monstrosities. The leaders do too, to a lesser extent... sometimes just as bad. I can't attach images but search for leader images on your favorite search engine and then compare Civ5 to Civ6. Why they made this awful design choice is anyone's guess. They seem to be trying to cartoonize the game or casualize it or make it resemble fortnite? I do not know but it is truly unappealing to the eye. The same with CIV6's bright obnoxious color palette. 
Civilization 6 sacrifices too much in lieu of a more casual cartoony aesthetic. I replaced the governor photos with anime characters because I can't take the game seriously when it looks like an ugly cartoon.
The unit sizes are small looking and combat is unsatisfying to watch. Maybe due to the ugly models?
I don't understand how everything is worse but search ""Civilization Wonders quotes"" and then Civilization 6 quotes"" on YT and look at the differences of the aesthetic. I really like the wonder building animations for CIV6 but it is lessened by the ugly palette and textures. It almost looks like a mobile game for children or something.  The models are too big and bulky? Like they are made of melted bright crayons. If there was a visual overhall to transform it back to a more toned down not ADHD sugar cartoon aesthetic I would use it. This goes for 2D and 3D art. It's like a wise old reliable and dignified man full of wisdom suddenly donned a clown outfit and wig and is gargling legos. It's a genre mismatch. Civilization is not a game for twitchy children and never will be. It is for strategy gamers who like things slow and turn based. It should have a dignified respectable art style with effort put in and not something derived from the pages of a coloring book.
I still to this day keep the CIV4 soundtrack to listen to. The music was so fantastic, I keep it on a playlist to listen to for other games. CIV5 was similar. The music for CIV6 isn't bad but it doesn't carry the same gravitas as before. But I'm no music expert and cannot go into more detail. I'm not a crazy expert CIV player just a more seasoned fan giving my opinion and review. The gameplay is also less fun. I'm sorry, but I do not like districts. It seems more like work than fun to have to deal with them. Naval combat is too non-essential. A unit in a rowboat (A land unit embarked) even if it is a military unit should not have any chance against even the most basic military ship. Should be instant death. Actually embarking in general is not fun, would be nice if the units actually had to be transported and if there were special worker ships instead of workers embarked possibly ships with a use besides building things so they can generate passive food/gold on a tile while asleep so the ""worker charges"" system is still implemented. The diplomacy system feels gutted and foolish. No vassal states still makes me very disappointed. If I destroy someone's entire civilization and I offer their last little hole in the wall town to be their suzerain they should almost always comply unless they are a very prideful culture with strong ""until the last man"" morals. But no, no suzerains anymore. Just over city states which doesn't even make sense as you barely have influence on them and aren't obligated to protect them. Also city states have no loyalty? Suzerain system feels unrealistic and flaky.

TL;DR Cartoon aesthetic ugly, looks like a kids game, music worse than previous titles, gameplay changes are generally not great when it comes to ocean, diplomacy, and roads/trade routes/workers."

Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"They decide to release an Anthology that has everything? Awesome. Except it's only available to those who do not already own any part of the bundle, and there are no discounts on any of the other parts separately from the Anthology anyway. What kind of sense does that make?"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,This game is really good but the support team could use some help. I have looked thoughly through disscussion board and chats trying to find a souliton to the crashing every time game is opened problem and it is hopeless. They tell you to reinstall game but game still does not comply.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"The game doesn't work since 2020 updates. Check everywhere you want before buying, IT DOESN'T WORK, DON'T BUY IT!"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I really want to like this game, but I just cannot. The problem in encapsulated in one easy to understand issue: It can take 12 turns to research a technology and then 42 turns to exploit it, by which time you've already researched 3 other more advanced technologies. You never get to ""enjoy"" the fruits of a technology or civic, even on Marathon time scales, because production is so much slower than research."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Pour your time into Civ, not a girlfriend. Cleopatra will love you more anyways. I hate you Emma."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Dear Firaxis, you really need to fix the asset limit problem. This should be technically possible since the limit has been halved in the past. Now the game has very limited room left for modding, and many of the community's best creations, including Leugi's City Style, Urban Complexity, Resourceful 2 and especially Warfare Expanded."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Bought the core game years ago and love it unfortunately when i wanted to upgrade to new scenario packs I'm excluded from bundle deals. Its infuriating that I can't get a reasonable price on the DLC packs because I already own a part of the DLC bundle deal. This is the pinnacle of poor treatment of return customers.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"at the moment not recommended
Game crashes regularly after some rounds - for many many people.

only fix: save every round and reload if game crashes.

want to buy ? wait for fix"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"You know this is a garbage game when the company is forced to raise the price of the previous game in the series made years before, to keep this one competitive."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"It's pretty annoying to use a separate system to run the game. Literally, I tried to set the game to play for an hour."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,This is my go-to game if I want to waste time. I get lost in the games and enjoy playing it. AI does need to be improved though.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Great game for history fans. The environmental effects give a unique challenge.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"pretty good civ game, but not as good as 5 imo. not fun at all without the dlc packs."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Devoting all of your life in this stupid game
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Super awesome. Its gameplay is based off of actual fun and not addiction, like most games these days. It's overwhelming at first but once you've done your first game you'll be an absolute pro. You can play alone or with friends. Watching your civilization expand is super fun. Battle mechanics have gotten a lot better since Civ 5. City expansion has also gotten much cooler. I overall love this game. 10/10."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Combining the time from this account, with the time from the account that I used to share with someone else, I have played this game for about 4000 hours.

I think I might have a problem...
Just one more turn...

This is, in my opinion, one of the best 4X games you can currently get. It's definitely worth getting Gathering Storm and Rise and Fall expansions, these two really add a lot. New Frontier Pass is also a lot of fun. 
I only had a little bit of problems with the new launcher and occasionally multiplayer is kinda buggy.
The developers are very active and they fix stuff regularly, so I think those small problems will soon be solved!

I recommend buying it on sale."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Just as a game should be...Fun and full of laughter.

"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"best  stratergy game iv played, its a def recommended one you should play if your a gamer"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"The latest version of Civ, is the best version in my opinion.  The district system adds depth and strategy to city construction, and thus more depth and strategy in the game.  Continuation of the one unit per tile policy was the right move as it enhances all of the military encounters.  I am also enjoying the graphics despite the fact many have called them ""cartoony"". Unless Humankind surprises everyone, this will continue to be the best strategy game of its kind available and more than worth a buy.  I would recommend picking up the rise and fall and gathering storm dlcs.  The new frontier pass has some interesting content, but is definitely not worth it unless you can pick it up at a pretty big discount."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Very addicting game RPG
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,pretty good game i suppose
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I wish I could recommend this game (base game plus Rise & Fall and Gathering Storm). I played Civ III and way too much Civ IV. Civ VI has a lot of new features (or new-to-me features) that I like. Some of these features are 1) dual knowledge-advancement trees (one being ""technology,"" the other one ""civics;"" 2) the new city building features based around districts and the increased importance of terrain; 3) potential for more battle tactics with ranged units and only 1 unit per hex (I realize this isn't new for Civ V players); 4) role of city states; 5) dynamic trade routes; 6) religions with different attributes/bonuses. These are some of the many new features that add depth and more paths to victory. 

BUT, after playing about 40 hours, mainly in offline mode, as much as I would like to play, I just can't convince myself it's worth the time sink. Why? BRAIN-DEAD A.I. 

The A.I. is woefully inept militarily. They barely build any military units, and are unable to carry out an effective siege once you have city walls. You may face a challenging warrior/chariot rush early on, but after that, there is absolutely no military challenge. With no serious threat or struggle for survival, the game just feels empty, almost as if you aren't even playing with any AI. I played on Emperor difficulty, which is lvl 6 in a system where lvl 8 is the hardest. 

My guess is that the developers made a game packed with cool features, but ultimately they are features that the AI cannot handle or take advantage of. Civ IV AI doom-stacks weren't very elegant, but at least the AI knew how to conquer a city with one, Civ VI military is a joke. Aside from no military competition, it's already too easy to blaze ahead in technology. Bomber planes in the 1200s? You advance in tech so fast. Before you can even make the units or buildings of an era, you have already advanced to a new era. Only the earliest eras (classical eras) seem to last awhile. You go from the medieval to the industrial era way too fast.

Overall, disappointing. Lots of potential, but too easy to be engaging. 
With the incompetent AI, maybe multi-player can save this game? Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to play multiplayer consistently, so I cannot comment on multi-player."

Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,My wife left me
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,I like the idea of districts. I do not like the new world congress or era points. It really bogs down the game and makes it too fixated on achieving era points rather than playing how you want to play. The world congress isnt even fun its not even well thought through. I liked where it was actually voting on world policies rather than small meaingless things. I actually have decided to move back to civ 5 after hours of playing simply because i miss the more complex world congress.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"[h1] From Hero to Zero, how far this franchise has fallen [/h1]

I have sat on writing this review for so long because of how much I have adored the Civilization franchise over the years, and how many wonderful hours I have spent preventing Ghandi's nuking philosophy in Civ 3,  fearing Montezuma's Jaguar rush in Civ 4, and holding the line on Diety difficulty with Haile Selasse in Civ 5. My only known quotient of time spent would be 2,000+ hrs on Civ 5.

It pains me to have to give a negative review for Civilization 6, even after I have given so much time for them to improve the game to a quality standard - far longer then it took with expansions from previous iterations. There are a few things I find enjoyable as a base: the graphic style, the district system, and the AI (although not close to perfect) is a step forward from previous iterations - especially from a tactical stand point. Instead of building off what are some promising systems, the publisher and developer continue to push this product towards a flaming pile of garbage. Here are my general opinions on the current state of this game.

[u] Too much depth, not enough substance [/u] 

Firaxis (and likely directed by 2K Games) have chosen to move towards fluff instead of fibre. From the first instalment of Civilization 6, there has been fundamental flaws with the economic system like no other previous version has had. Production is broken - period. There is no other resource in this game that will guarantee you victories like stacking production into oblivion. Gold is far too inflated right from the start of a match, meaning that by mid game you are seeing costs that are so unnecessarily high that you need an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of purchasing goals. Faith is a rollercoaster - some Ages it is worthless, and other Ages it is overpowering. What was an interesting transition in Civ 5 to bring in tourism, has completely forced culture generation in Civ 6 to be limited in value; additionally, the great work and great person system is far less enjoyable as it's functionally has been complicated and reduced (respectively). These are the [b] base [/b] resources for the game, and since the OG version, Firaxis has only doubled down on inflating the complexity by adding [b] far more [/b] resources to counter balance, instead of attempting to resolve their broken economics. A shame really, as previous iterations of Civ worked on resolving their flaws with each expansion.

[u] The Frontier F-up [/u]

Well, what hasn't been said on any other game with predatory DLC practices. This sits there right up with another known developer that sounds like a ""pair of ducks"". After completing 3 expansions, and having all the flaws as said above, Firaxis pushed a non-requested DLC package on to players with [i] new features [/i] that would [i] improve the game [/i]. At the same time, a game breaking exploit that was well known for years by players and was repeatedly advised to Firaxis was ignored. As such, when the DLC was released and the company was (deservedly) given poor reviews on the state of the product, they finally fixed this exploit. Additionally, the content provided took away from the existing systems and created new ones. The civs and leaders added were far more powerful then what was existing in the game. Then to rub salt in the wound, Firaxis would seemingly do something that has truly pushed me to this bad review.

[u] Multiplayer is [b] unplayable [/b] [/u]

This catastrophe finally did it for me. I've never really been huge into multiplayer to be fair. Most of my hours spent over the years has been in solo play. But when I have played with friends, it has been some of the most competitive, humorous, and yet relaxing game play I have experience. The Frontier Pass, and whatever changes it made in the game, has now made the multiplayer so laggy I feel like I'm back playing OG Starcraft on dial up. It is completely unacceptable to have the end of my turn not complete until other players have nearly finished their turn, due to the lag. What the hell Firaxis?!? Are they seriously unaware as to how much this coding mess has created with all these brand new ""bells and whistles"" fluff like secret societies, industries, and random meteor showers? If they are aware, it sure is silence on their part. But of course, new events and influencer videos should fix my frustrations with it, right? (pardon the salty sarcasm)

[b] Lesson learned - if it's broke, just don't buy it [/b]

To wrap this up, I am now dissuaded from playing the product I bought, encouraged to play the previous version of Civilization, and resolved to not purchase anything further from Firaxis until they have demonstrated that a quality product can be made. It is unfortunate, as it is likely the publisher (2K, I'm still calling you out too) forcing these decisions to be made in the way they are. 

If you care about quality, buy Civilization 5, or Civilization 4 even. Both are gems of their time, hopefully not to be lost forever due to another money grab."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Haven't played a lot of strategy games but this one is certainly one of the best ones. But, forget about multiplayer, this one is a solo experience."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,epic
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"As a long time fan of the series, I have mixed feelings about this one. I like the game a lot, but the big downside is that the AI offers very little strategy for a strategy game. The game still offers a lot of good civ action though - it takes a while to learn and it's good fun to learn and master it all. Just expect a tomato can AI that will literally do nothing while you beat them up (the problem goes all the way up to Deity, the hardest difficulty). To compensate for it's poor decisions the AI gets huge bonuses to everything on the highest levels. I'm sad and disappointed to see an otherwise masterpiece of a game be dragged down to mediocracy by an abysmal AI.  6/10"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,This version of Civilization is great because of the replayability. It feels fresh and makes it fun to play each civilization as they feel very diverse. Winning on diety can be satisfying although AI in the game can clearly be improved in future versions it feels like a nice engine. Multiplayer has been good although has suffered some issues these seemed to be fixed with the support the game seems to have from Firaxis.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,It's sad.  I used to love to spend an evening just hitting enter for one more turn.  The last year or so I have not been able to enjoy the game as it freezes early in any game whether I have mods or DLC or not.  I refuse to try any more fixes on my end as I have tried to play this on three different computers without success.  I have tried multiple settings/exceptions and accept no more responsibility.  This game is broken and I will not recommend this for anyone wanting to purchase it now.  I am not someone who will go out of their way to say yay or nay normally but I believe anyone looking at this game now should be warned.

Factorio,Strategy,427520,"Not a game. This is a metaphor for the brutality of human endeavor. An ominous pillar of assailing fumes rising up from the horizon, scarring the once green lands.

You are an outsider, an alien presence on this tarnished exo-solar planet not unlike our own, covered with water, trees and resources ripe for exploitation. You have one goal in mind: oppress the natives and expand your industrial empire at all costs.  

The same natives who will grow increasingly agitated at the blight's proliferation, and strike the sources of infection. This is where you will shoot them with guns, fire and nukes, reminding them of who is on top of the evolutionary chain. You will build even more elaborate contraptions to smash them more firmly, and satisfy your ego. 

As cities rise and fall your commonwealth of sickness will occupy every inch in sight, you will commit mass genocide without ever questioning your actions, laying down your 50th railway as atomic justice rains down on your adversaries. 

Endless conveyor belts, machinations and entangled constructs leading nowhere. A hunger that fuels itself eternally.

Factorio,Strategy,427520,Incredibly fun game about automation and logistics.  Harvest resources to process in increasingly complex recipes.  Constantly monitor production to identify shortages and bottlenecks to optimize older portions of your facility.  Watch your factory expand to meet the needs of your expanding factory.  Clear the forests with a flamethrower to make room for another field of solar panels.  Annihilate the native alien population with heavy artillery bombardment to safely acquire another iron deposit and briefly wonder if you're the bad guy before noticing the 2% increase in iron plate production and eyeing neighboring bug hives with logistical intent.

Factorio,Strategy,427520,"Remember what Blizzard games used to be like? Simple, fun, deep, polished, well optimized, well supported by the devs and infinitely moddable? Thats what Factorio and the literal small independent development team making the game reminds me of.

The game itself - its a factory automation game, sort of like if a zachtronics game broke free from its confines and spilled out onto the planet. The fun for most people seems to be in replaying the game, every game plays out different, you learn new things in the process and come up with new and improved factory designs more to your liking, and then you progress as far as whatever goals you set, and then you start again with the new knowledge, making a better factory, learning new things, etc etc.

After a few hundred hours when this might start to get tiring and the game loses some of its luster, there's mods. My god are there mods. I've played mods for this game that are more interesting and creative than entire games made by other studios. That's more a tribute to the many active and skilled mod developers doing really cool stuff than it is a slight at game studios. Seriously, the mods for this game are insane. 

The online community (various forums and people in multiplayer) is a very decent and friendly community in my experience.

10/10 if its your type of game. 11/10 even. It can be hard to ""get"" at first, and I didn't enjoy it my first time and only played 30 minutes or an hour. Tried it again a year later, jumped onto a random multiplayer map to see what the game is all about, and here I am 2,000 hours later having as much fun as I did when I started and knew nothing about the game."

Factorio,Strategy,427520,"I purchased Factorio a few years ago but didn't immediately fall in love with it like others have. I probably sat down and tried to get into it about 15-20 times but always seemed to lose interest after 2-4 hours.

Eventually Satisfactory released and I immediately got hooked, same with Dyson Sphere Program. After playing each of those factory games for hundreds of hours I decided to come back to Factorio - I know that it should be better than both of those games, having been in development for much longer.

Thankfully (or regrettably, depending on your stance on addictions) I came back and finally fell in love. Playing on default with the enemies slightly handicapped, I finally understood that the game-mechanic of having to defend your factory is almost essential. It's going to be hard going back to Satisfactory or Dyson Sphere Program without enemies you have to deal with - the monotony of simply expanding a factory without enemies has become apparent.

Also, the number of quality-of-life features is immense, and feels much more polished. If you're debating on factory games, this is one - if not, at least wait until Satisfactory and Dyson Sphere Program are fully released."

Factorio,Strategy,427520,"Fantastic game. About the only down side I can point to is I don't feel restarting a new game to be as compelling as in a game like say, Rimworld. Working through the tech tree in a fresh Factorio start can feel constraining after a playthrough or two. Want to make a bot base instead of a belt base? Sorry that's locked away behind end game tech. Of course, how many games can you say ""You know, it has some annoying features after you've beat it 2 or 3 times."" LOL, duh that's clearly a game worth your money."

Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,happy fifth anniversary! now pay for the celebration content we said would be free.
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,Really good game but the dlc´s are wayy too expensive. They should be like 5 bucks each
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"Best WW2 game, change my mind"
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,this game sucks
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"this game makes me want to take the alt history focus for germany called ""get some pussy and take a shower"" focus tree. everyone in this game makes me want to give myself multiple concussions and divebomb myself into a pit of sweat and PURE GAMING JUICE. ever since i heard that american soldiers unironically called japanese dive bombers in world war 2 ""baka bombs"" i have unironically wanted to castrate and hang myself on a cross to die for this games sins, because this game has a bucketload of sins. hearing the sweatest and angriest 12 year old struggle to talk to any form of woman in his life but explain to me how the panzer three division template can pierce the soviet river defensive line is honestly amazing in itself, like cmon bro im proud you can defeat the soviet union but can you GET A FUCKING LIFE???? also while we on this, how come everyone i meet in an rts game is a nazi. Im hunting down people who arent nazis in this game, if you're like me and you just want to play this game normally and not figure out how to get the roman empire in 1936 by shaving mussolinis ass and taking a trainride to the english channel to bomb the shit out of london. KIDS, IF YOU TRAVEL BACK IN TIME YOU DIDNT TAKE A GOD DAMN FOCUS TREE TO FIX YOUR INDUSTRY AS GERMANY, GERMANY WAS GOING TO LOSE THE WAR ANYWAY, STOP TELLING ME HITLER HAD SUCH A ROCKING BOD THAT HE CAN FIGHT A 2 FRONT WAR BECAUSE OF HIS META TANKS AND HIS REINFORCEMENT MEME. IM SO MAD I HATE THIS GAME SO MUCH ITS MAKING ME SEEP WITH RAGE AND ANGER, IM GONNA TAKE THE FOCUS TO DUMP CHILD SLAVES INTO A POOL OF LAVA AND DRINK THE FLUIDS TO EMPOWER MYSELF WITH THE SOULS TO CROSS THE GATE IN UNDERTALE SANS. anyways im reaching the character limit write a review for hearts of iron 4 plrease describe what you liked or disliked about this game SHUT UP STEAM I CAN DO WHAT I WANNNNNNNNNTTTT SUCK MY BAWLLLLSSSSSS. anyways the game is really good, id recommend playing it :D"

Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,Hoi4 fans be like:* looks at map * YO THIS GAMEPLAY IS FIRE
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,no just don't
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"In classic Paradox fashion, base game isn't the whole experience they are offering. Instead you are supposed to pay around 60-70 dollars for expansions and in total of 165 dollars for all DLC - that is if you are interested in costumes and music packs. Which I most certainly am not. Vanilla is obviously playable, but it isn't that enjoyable to play. Most expansions add (almost) needed changes/fixes and gameplay enhancing focus trees for less major countries, such as Hungary or Portugal. Seriously [i]Man the Guns[/i] expansion tweaks naval warfare and actually makes it fun. In base game it is as shallow as it gets - even with rather recent ""redone naval combat"".

Now. Why did I recommend this game? Because funnily enough, once you actually have these DLC's, game (un)surprisingly becomes fun. There are plenty of stuff to do. You can play historical focuses ON and play how WW2 was meant to be like (keep in mind, even with historical focuses, there are almost certainly historical inaccuracies). Or alternatively turn historical focuses OFF and enjoy the chaos that will endure. Obviously you can do this in vanilla as well, but expansions add so much flavor into the game - with extra focus trees and more things that you can do - no game is same experience.

PLUS if you have rich friends or friends that devote their whole unholy soul to Paradox, you can play multiplayer with them. As every player inherits DLC's from lobby host.

That being said, Hearts of Iron IV is easily easiest Paradox grand-strategy game out there. It is very easy to learn and easier to master than games like Europa Universalis IV. There is still enough depth to look forward into and most casual players will still find HOI4 difficult to play. Which makes it fun experience to play with friends. Keep in mind though, like every other Paradox game, it only operates 1 thread from your CPU, so it runs like trash. So even with beast computer, expect FPS drops with faster game speeds.

There are other nitpicks I could say, such as terrible new launcher they forced last year. However IF HEARTS OF IRON IV IS ON SALE, it is definitely worth a try. Don't expect too much though, as Paradox's quality control has been in deep decline since release of Stellaris."

Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,It's a great game what can I say.  If you get past the learning curve you will play hundreds of hours
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"After installing this game you probably never ever feel the touch of a woman. Nor will you see the light of day again.

I reccomend this game."
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"Really good game, but hard, don't play meme nations for your first goes"
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,Lol this game sucks
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"Wasted 1000 hours of my life, still learn nothing about this game. God damn Paradox."
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"Great game, but suffers from the monetization problems that all paradox games do. They'll sell you 40% of a game at full price, then charge you $19.99 each for another 40% of a game in 5% increments. If you want to end up with a mostly complete, replayable experience, you'll have to spend around $135 USD, and that's if you wait for a sale."
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,Best game to commit...
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"Vanilla HoI4 is very shallow and once you learn how to play it becomes trivial unless you actually purposefully handicap yourself in some way. AI, in classic PDX interactive fashion, is abysmal -- and will likely be abysmal forever. There are a few features that just do not matter at all and can safely be ignored if you play by the meta. A good rudimentary introduction to the genre, but if you want more and are sick of the slack then look around for other computer wargames. Worst of all, playing past the 2 hour refund limit causes the customer to be hit with a bolt from god that makes them a virgin forever.  What the hell, Paradox?"
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,perfect
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"This game is amazing.  It is quite complex so it will take you quite a while to figure it out, heck, I haven't even figured it out yet.

She waited in the dragon's keep, in the highest room of the tallest tower, for her true love and true love's first kiss."" [Laughing] Like that's ever gonna happen.

Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"I've only played for about 150 hours but i'm confident that i can make a atleast decent review about this game. I first just want to say that this game is amazing and is very fun to play mods with friends but here are some of my main complaints; The navy. it's pretty bad but it can be improved by buying the Man The Guns DLC and for most people that can be annoying. Paradox releases alot of DLC's that really should just be in the vanilla version of the game (the same apply's to Cities: Skylines and alot of their other games Paradox just wants money lol) I want to move onto skill trees specifically Italy's skill tree... It's not complex enough compared to the other skill trees, in other words; it's short and bad and Paradox still haven't even released a DLC for it. Now i'm going to list some pros/good things about the game; The immersion and realism. You have a choice if you want to play the game historically accurate but you also have a choice if you don't for an example; I was once allied with Soviet Union as Poland, I was once allied with the Soviet Union as Finland, and Mexico went to war with the USA. To digest this entire review: I definitely recommend hoi4 (Hearts of Iron IV) the game is very fun and immersive. If you don't have the money for it I would wait for a sale even thought its kinda rare it still goes on sale for 10 USD once in a blue moon. Lastly I just want to say that my grammer isn't the best and I don't write reviews often but regardless thank you for reading this and I hope you have a good day/night. :)"

Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"Its a fun war game but basically unplayable to people starting out with like 0 intro/tutorial so either look it up like a sane person would or what a hoi4 person would do and just wing it. speaking of hoi4 people we are all insane and a maschoist as this game makes you wanna die sometimes but also will be really fun sometimes. Also do not get this game unless you got another 100 dollars to spend on all the dlcs because that is the only way you can have fun in this game if you dont choose the majors of ww2.  Is it a good game yes, but the paid updates are SUCH bullshit it ruins the experince if you dont have the money to buy all the important ones. Also if you notice any problem in the main game not adressed by a dlc realize it will never be fixed till 5 years later and you pay money for it such as the soviet focus tree and the italian one. Despite these issuies if you want a fun map war game to play choose this"

Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"This game is simply awesome and the community is wonderfull and nice to be around. Game is designed very accuratly (based on the ww2 scenario) and the extra detail put in is just a cherry on top. I really enjoy compleating challenges and simply learning how to outmanouver the enemy via making the better strategic decisions. I also guarantie you that ingame ww2 knowledge will come in handy at school and will widen your horizon. At the end I need to mention mods which spice up the whole thing and basicly redesign whole storyline of the game to a brand new one, yet there I have a problem to mention. If you don t have the latest game (update) most of them will be out of your reach.
Taking all this into consideration, the game is well designed and worth a try 10/10"
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"It's a really fun, really in depth WW2 RTS Game. It doesn't feature any actual combat that you can command etc. Instead it's more a stat based game where your units need to have better stats etc to beat the enemy. It's a lot of fun still, just be aware that you will not be fighting battles like in R.U.S.E. or COH2 or MOWAS 2...

Good graphics, Sounds, Game Mechanics etc.

Only issue i have had is some of the achievements i get in game not popping on steam and having to reload a save or just plain redoing the whole campaign to get it. 

All in all a fun game and definitely worth getting, though i would say wait for a special!

10/10

P.S. Get this game if you wanna just fight WW2 as any nation, and just do he craziest stuff ever... Imagine as South Africa breaking out from british rule, Puppeting the UK and becoming leader of the allies... Or Germany becoming a democracy and joining the allies..."

Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"A very good game, even if you only have a DLC, or even no dlc at all. You could always go to the workshop and grab yourself lots of free mods made by the lovely HOI4 modding community, that are very goodly made. Hell, there's even mod about star wars! So overall from me, it's an excellent game."

Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"Very good, even better with mods, 50/10"
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,Don't buy it or any of the DLC if they're not on sale.
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"I like watching a map for 5 hours straight, not understanding most of it."
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"other reviews can say it better than me but, this is a great game!"
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,What else is there to say its HOI IV I have put so many hours into the mods for this game having fun with friends building funny empires and pulling backstabby moves its just well what else is there to say its a fun game and if you haven't played it watch a stream or check out a youtube video about this game. It is indepth and there is a lot of dlc but once you get into it. Well it will suck you in lol.
Hearts of Iron IV,Strategy,394360,"I'm sure the game is fun, but I've played this game for about 50 hours and I still don't know how to use most of the advanced mechanics.  People always say that it's extremely fun once you learn, but the tutorial and game are extremely unforgiving to newcomers; it dumps all of this information without explaining when or why you need to do this stuff.  Additionally, the DLCs are way overpriced and are kind of a ripoff.  If you have played other games like this, you'll have fun.  Otherwise, I'd steer clear unless you have a lot of time on your hands."

Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,"I open this game everyday thinking ""Today is the day I get a full run"". Then click on watcher and die on the first elite I see.
10/10 Maybe I'll get my Watcher run tomorrow."
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,"Easy to play, difficult to master. Almost endless replayability, and with mods, makes it even more worth the price! Moved from Hearthstone to this, never looked back. Saving tons of money too!"
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,It's fine.
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,"I bought StS back when the game only had two characters. Since then it's built into quite the nice deck builder/rougelike, and the person who made the game obviously cares about it. The beta art is hilarious, and IIRC this was the first of its kind (that's actually caught on as a trend, deck building/rougelike combo). The art is charming to look at, the strategies you come up with can become hilariously broken, but the game still manages to stay challenging to master. I definitely recommend picking it up"
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,"this games is bad for only  those who are lucky who are not me and i am unlucky so this game is not for me and if you are also unlucky like me then dont play it, It is fun and cool sometimes, but i dont get the cards i need amd if i go the cards i needed like that Omega first tirn then i would win but i dont get Omega first turn thats why the game is bad. However, the developers can redeem themselves by giving me a 5th character and also giving me their company Thank You Very Much, sincerely, slay the spire"
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,this game is a deckbuilder made for people who are scared of deck builders. this game is surprisingly intuitive to play and ive found myself immediately addicted. i would definitely recommend this game to ANYONE who wants a new game. its even fun to play with friends if you stream with discord
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,lots of replayability best game to play all the time i keep coming back
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,"I didn't buy the new Monster Train DLC because this game is much more challenging on its own.

Then there's also UwU waifu mods."
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,Digital Crack Cocaine
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,it's kinda fun i guess
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,"Slay the Spire does a lot of things right. At face value many of the cards and relics (passives earned throughout the run) do okay things, but putting together two, three or even ten cards gives you a beautiful synergy between the effects they individually bring to the table. Even though some cards are more generally useful, like Wraith Form, every card has its place. There is a world where picking up a Claw is the best choice, even if you might not like it. Everything in Slay the Spire builds off each other, like taking a card to beat the first boss, and later taking a card that wants you to have the first one. 10/10"
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,Played the game on Switch and it is exhilarating! Totally worth every minute playing it.
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,"Tips. Dont eat the cards, they dont taste good"
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,Damnn this game 10/10
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,"10/10 a very fun gameplay, so many different builds you can choose"
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,I don't have a slightest hope of beating the game. yet I can't stop trying.
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,Hell to the yeah. Great deck building fun. Never the same run twice.
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,basically single player Dominion
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,"This game is seriously addicting, workshop mods change it up in a ton of ways as well. If you want a good casual strategic card game. This is the one."
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,very good game thanks mega crit
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,Bought that game twice (Steam and PS4). Worth every dollar.
Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,"The description says, “We fused card games and roguelikes together to make the best single player deckbuilder we could.”

Pioneering an entire subgenre by making a quality game with lots of replayability is the best you could do? Talk about underwhelming."

STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack,Strategy,32470,"Amazing game. The graphics are potato but the immersive gameplay makes up for it. I suggest to also install either or both Thrawns Revenge and Fall of the Republic Mods. These are possibly some of the best addons for the game. Any Star Wars fan or non Star Wars who who enjoys strategy games would really enjoy this early 2000's masterpiece. Enjoy being the next Grand Moff Tarkin, Darth Vader, Mon Mothma or Admiral Ackbar. This is not a trap. B)"
STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack,Strategy,32470,"I've owned this game since its original release a LOOONG time ago (as in physical disks well before the Steam era), and it's still one of the best RTS's out there. The folks at Petroglyph were mostly veterans of Westwood's C&C franchise, before EA screwed that up, and Empire at War (EaW) represents some of the finest RTS gameplay I've ever seen. Deep, uniquely Star Wars, just incredible. Beyond the Steam time I've got another solid 1000 hours, it's a game you can keep coming back to. 

With the introduction of Steamworks support a few years back, the modding scene has started moving again so once you're done with the base game, there remains thousands of hours of GOOD content out there for you to explore.

Dive in, it's great."
STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack,Strategy,32470,"Star war - Yes
Amazing graphics - Yes
Mods - Yes
Empire - Yes
Still fun after years - Yes

If you enjoy star wars, YOU WILL ENJOY this game."
STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack,Strategy,32470,"This game is and probably always will be my favorite Star Wars game. I remember seeing a YouTube let's play series of this game with the Republic at War mod almost a decade ago when I was 9 years old, and I knew I had to get it. I ordered a copy that may have been a tad bit overpriced off ebay and played it for countless hours that aren't on steam (Except I couldn't figure out how to make mods work back then so I didn't end up playing republic at war until years later). A few years later I got a massive Star Wars bundle on Steam for sale, and this was in it. I proceeded to put hundreds of more hours into this game. 

There isn't much else to say that hasn't been said in the other reviews. It's incredibly satisfying to take over the galaxy, building up your army to colossal proportions. The space combat in particular is intense, fun, and strategic. The same cannot be said about the ground combat, however. Most of the time I end up auto-resolving land battles, which sucks because I feel like the ground vehicles and weapons in Star Wars deserve a lot more love than they get. Also, the management of your empire should be more involved. You can't start trade routes, you can't make laws or policies, and there are no systems in place that take into consideration the population of your empire. No public unrest, or amenities, or even unhappiness. All of the buildings you build go towards either the economy or warfare. It would be so cool to build arenas like the one in Attack of the Clones, or government buildings on Coruscant. Just anything really. I would go so far as to say that the galaxy overview is just barely a step above the main menu, mainly being a vessel to bring you to battles. However, it's important to remember that the game is 15 years old now, and many of the features I just talked about weren't as common or developed in the genre. I just really wish there was a little more focus on the ""Empire"" aspect in ""Empire at War"". 

After all that negative, it may seem like I don't really like the game, but that's not true at all. The ability to use heroes is really cool, and it's fun using characters you wouldn't expect, like old man obi-wan, or yoda. Some heroes can also smuggle credits or steal technologies, which adds a little more depth to them. Along with the unexpected nature of some heroes, there are some weird vehicles and planets in this game, a lot of them being their only appearance outside of books and comics. Also, the modding community is top-notch. The work that some of these people do is phenomenal, and it really turns this game into something truly special. The quantity of mods is nowhere near Minecraft or Skyrim levels, but the quality is unreal. 

Overall, I'd give the vanilla game a low 7/10 maybe even a 6.5. I have a lot of nostalgia for it, but there are definitely a lot of flaws. With mods, however, I'd give it an 8.5 or a 9. Even though it's my favorite Star Wars game, I don't think it's the best. The space combat is amazing, and the modding community is awesome, but the issues I have with the game would require a full on remake or sequel (sidenote: this should definitely happen) to be fixed. I would really only recommend this game to Star Wars fans (which granted is a massive group of people), but if you're just a strategy fan, I'd say avoid it unless it's on a deep sale."

Crafting recipes are more abstract and generic (everything is built from circles, squares and primary colours), but with a neat shape-building twist that leads to some really fun spatial problem-solving."
shapez.io,Strategy,1318690,"Just a really good game that is both relaxing and challenging at the same time.

Big kudos for the excellent onboarding experience. Every single mechanic is introduced very carefully, the tutorials are perfectly integrated and the hints are always placed where you need them, when you need them.

It's not a game for everyone but if you like the idea of building a giant factory of shapes being cut, rotated and painted over and see them move around you'll love this game.

Total War: MEDIEVAL II – Definitive Edition,Strategy,4700,Still a fantastic game in 2021
Total War: MEDIEVAL II – Definitive Edition,Strategy,4700,"In a realm of rivalries, intrigue and plots, what does one damsel matter? When lords are being routinely slaughtered on the battlefield, with the prisoner of wars heads being scalped and flung over catapults into the city square, why does one nubile 18 year old harridan bear any degree of significance? Is it not instead the men bearing steel that matter in these turbulent times? IS IT NOT THEM WHO WATCH THEIR BROTHERS GORGED ATOP A PIKE, OR ENVISION THEIR LIMBS BEING HACKED OFF BY ISLAMIC HERETICS? I yet again present a moral quandary, is it fair that I am to be skewered by an Englishmen, a rambunctious Saesneg, for the sole crime of pollinating his daughter and wife? I tell you, even as I sit atop the bloodstained ground, I do not regret ploughing his daughter and wife, for it was as though I was striding across a wheatfield, oh how the wind parted the hem of her dress, permitting myself convenient and swift entry. I copulated with these two stunning damsels, bearing a smile atop my face, simultaneously before and after the wounds were inflicted across my chest. For who could not be exuberant in these auspicious times? This upstart nobleman, this utter depraved fiend, observed his virgin daughter become deflowered, with his wife being thoroughly titillated by my deftly skillful abilities as a master consummator. It must have angered that surly upstart, filled him with the smoldering rage of Duna, imbued him with such immense fury, that would then be channeled into the arbitrary, albeit powerful swings of his sword. 

Despite, entering his estate armed, anticipating conflict, I was ultimately taken at surprise. I had to hastily fasten my breeches, don my sword and fend back the beasts rapid oncoming blows. However, despite my initial attempts in the duel yielding fruition, I realized that my fate was inevitable. This man, although bearing English descent, which of course insinuates an inherent lack of expertise, was a mad, mouth frothing beast, one who would naught cease his efforts until I lay upon the ground, with a fatal wound at my side. As such, albeit acknowledging my fate and the futility of this duel, I obstinately held on until the very end. Until my capitulation, I contemplated about many a venture, I gave prayer and reverence to Protestant Jesus, recited Gandalf’s philosophy regarding the afterlife, realized that Mike Tyson is a homeless man, who has donned an exoskeleton suit to triumph in the MMA and lastly, I fondly recalled the sweet delectable taste, of this Englishman’s wife. It was that last thought, which remained prominent in my mind as the lethal blow was inflicted across my chest. I recall falling to the ground, being transported onto a wide green field, outside the castle expanse where my brothers loitered, all the while simultaneously bearing a jubilant grin atop my face. It was then that I serenaded to them the story of my exploits and my subsequent defeat, at the hands of a feisty Englishman. 

A ballad, nay the elaborate tale, upon the slaughter of my gallant and promiscuous Welsh monarch at the hands of a furious, cuckholded Saesneg, whose nubile harlot of a wife was seduced.

The Englishman's wife was as fair as the sun,
and her kisses were warmer than spring.
But the Englishman's blade was made of black steel,
and its kiss was a terrible thing.
The Englishman's wife would sing as she bathed,
in a voice that was sweet as a peach,
But the Englishman's blade had a song of its own,
and a bite sharp and cold as a leech.
As I lay on the ground with the darkness around,
and the taste of his blood on my tongue,
My brothers knelt by me and prayed a sombre prayer,
Albeit I smiled and laughed and sung,
""Brothers, oh brothers, my days here are done,
the Englishman's taken my life,
But what does it matter, for all men must die,
and I've tasted the Englishman's wife!"""

Desperados III,Strategy,610370,"GOTY 2020 for me, hands down, as a big fan of RTT game since long ago. 

I bought the Deluxe Edition, Mimimi Games honour their promises with the season pass and more, with cool & free contents. I hope you'll continue to provide excellent game like this in the future, SW and DIII are miracles in an ocean of mediocrity !"
Desperados III,Strategy,610370,"This is a solid strategy game with some interesting mechanics and TONS of different ways to solving almost every situation. I can't stress how important that is to make a game like this fun. Too often developers make puzzles that require a single solution. Not here! They did a great job of giving each character abilities that give very different options, strengths, and weaknesses. The campaign combines different pairs of characters for most missions, forcing you to come up with neat new ways to synergize!

There weren't actually many 'cons' to the game. I only experienced a couple of very minor bugs. My only real complaint is the way they implemented the Showdown mechanic seems like a mess. A 'pause' function with the ability to queue an action for each character would have been perfect here, whereas the Showdown is the only pause, but it changes all your controls to no real benefit. A good portion of my reloads were due to Showdown mode messing things up."
Desperados III,Strategy,610370,"This game is a masterpiece and reminds me of the good ol' days playing the rest of the series plus the commandos series. This genre is one of my favourite types because of the high replayability, the challenges and the game length. It's definitely worth a shot!"
Desperados III,Strategy,610370,"Like the old school stealth tactics games of yore (Desperados, Commandos, etc.). With all the modern quality of life improvements you'd expect. Highly recommend."
Desperados III,Strategy,610370,This game will make you think like a chess player
Desperados III,Strategy,610370,"Basically Shadow Tactics with cowboy skins. Some character abilities can feel a bit too similar if you've played Shadow Tactics, but then, who else is making real time tactical games in 2020? If you loved Commandos series, this is a no-brainer."
Desperados III,Strategy,610370,Really awesome tactical stealth game and I'm not especially fond of the genre (though I did love the original back in the day)
Desperados III,Strategy,610370,"I had not played the previous Desperados games, but I love this one! The characters in this game are terrific with some really imaginative skills, and finding new ways to use them together is distinctly satisfying. The graphics and sound are great -- really evocative of 19th century New Orleans. Every level in this game is superbly designed, some real head scratching moments here. Definitely recommend this one!"
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"This is a fantastic and highly addictive game. 
When is Endless Space 3 coming out?"
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"It's a good game, definitely worth the money. The battles are very well made, both fun to watch and with just enough tactics involved. Overall the experience is polished. On the negative side is that the AI struggles to play the game, as with many of these types of games. I've played two campaigns, one on normal and one on serious, and the enemies have not once sieged one of my planets, and I'm no expert player. Would be very interested in what the developer has in store for their next game! A big step forward would be an AI that can keep up."
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,Good Scifi game. With the ESG mod this is a perfect game.
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"Solid 4X with fun lore, neat combat, clean visuals."
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"While Endless Space 2 attempts grandeur in battles between space empires, there is quite a bit to be desired. While the game promotes the ability to win in a variety of ways, there really isn't that many options. More than likely, you'll be forced into a technology or economy victory, as the AI will hardly ever allow an influence victory and galactic conquest is almost entirely out of the question due to dated mechanics. There is beautiful planets, and you do feel a sense of discovery while sending probes to investigate anomalies. There is even some custom dialogue that makes opponents feel a bit more real. However, the majority of time playing is attempting to understand a complex 4X strategy to only be underwhelmed at how small the game feels once understood. Like real space, Endless Space 2 feels mostly empty."
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"Endless Space? More like Endless Bugs.

Sincerely, 
A Patient player of 3 years. 

Which you've just lost"
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"While combat itself is a bit simplistic (ship design is still complex), this game is absolutely beautiful to look at and has hands down the best UI I have ever seen. Would totally recommend!"
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,Love that it kept my attention for 379 hours and counting.... Just one more turn... Like any other 4X game.
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,Endless Space Two is a beautiful game that have a very interesting premise and changing game play depending on the faction chosen.

Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,Strategy,418240,For Desperado and Commandos series lovers.
Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,Strategy,418240,"Very well-flowing Desperados-esque tactical game. Very seamless to controll the different characters, and easy to set up multiple actions. I can't really come up with any real problems with the game. Also very lovely storytelling from what I assume is set in real Japanes history, but with some embellishments. Highly recomended."
Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,Strategy,418240,"A beautiful turn-based game based on the Medieval period in Japan where the concept of Samurai and Shogun was prominent. This game will let you experience the same while controlling different people of certain backgrounds - Samurai, Kunoichi, Ninja and all..
The experience was great but the thing I hated the most was, whenever you get spotted, your character moves 75% slower than his/her usual speed which made me lose my patience at times.
Still, its a fun game.."
Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,Strategy,418240,"Haaaaaa, so frustrating yet so fun, I love the game. But at times I hate it so much."
Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,Strategy,418240,"This game is worth much less than the original price, if you find it on discount buy it. If you have ever played Desperados 1, this game is almost a carbon copy. Not just the gameplay, but each character's skills are 90% of the time the same as those from desperados, not even shuffled between your characters. You've got John Cooper with which you start the game. You've got Kate, having literally the exact same skills. Japanese Doc - Takuma, then Japanese Sanchez - Mugen. Like, literally the same skills. There are hardly any bugs and the game does play well although camera angles are sometimes awkward even with rotation. But content-wise, this game is a carbon copy of the first Desperados, almost nothing new has been implemented, only sugarcoated with better graphics and camera rotation. Of course, relying on a working formula isn't necessarily a bad thing but I put a negative review because the game is way too overpriced for what it is, and it is quite bland as there is almost no innovation, at least nothing worth noticing. At this point, the game is good but definitely not for this price. Buy only on a massive discount."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"Conquered half of China and declared myself the Emperor. The remaining kingdoms united and declared war on me. The war  was going in my favor in the beginning, but they just kept coming and then they slowly turned the tide of war. Now they are deep in my territory and are laying siege on my capital right now. They also killed my beloved son and heir to the throne. 20/10 would get destroyed by petty kingdoms again."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"I grew up playing total war games along with many others, some of those being the Dynasty warriors series, which I loved, 3 & 4 in particular. 

That said I really enjoy the historical nature of the total war series and am a big fan of mods like NTW3 for Napoleon TW, which really add to that aspect.

So when I purchased TW3Ks I thought it was a beautiful game with an enjoyable campaign. That is until I dropped into a battle and saw my entire army massacred by Lu Bu. It really got under my skin that 1 person could do that and just made battles pointless. 

But I gave the game some time and slowly came to realise that it combined my love of the total war series and dynasty warriors in a very satisfying way.

In previous titles like Rome II or Attila I didn't really care about my generals, so long as my army was decent I felt like I could win, regardless of who was commanding. So investing in the military and buildings to support the armies was more important than any character in the game, which I felt left me a bit detached.  

In three Kingdoms it hurt when I lost a general in battle, or it felt awesome, that through my hard work and movement along the skill tree I could see them overcome an enemy general in combat and lead their Inspired troops on to a great victory cutting swathes through the enemy lines. 

I just felt more of a connection with the characters, a good general could really turn the tide of battle and that investing in them was important, that's what brings the connection. 

There's also a great deal of mods that can add to the depth, giving characters a biography and individual portraits etc. so that they really stand out. 

Overall I would recommend the game, I thoroughly enjoy the, mechanics, battles, campaign etc. And for a Historical player of the franchise, it bridges the gap nicely between historical and fantasy. 

That said I hope they don't do away with historical titles completely, Empire II total war anyone?! 

Enjoy, Cheers!"
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"I just can't with this game any more; between units just stopping mid-attack to the inability for the game to actually recognize the changes to battle maps, it's purely frustrating at this point to find any further enjoyment from this game.

Don't get me wrong, I have always enjoyed the Total War series, but it feels like every update to this game makes the basics worse.  I've had too many actively played battles that failed because the interface refused to properly recognize where I was directing troops (literally battles where clicking on spot on the map directed troops backwards), troops just stopping for no reason, lack of response, and I can't count how many times archers and siege weapons acted in melee mode when set to shoot when selecting a target to attack.

Beyond the battles, it's also mind-boggling that with the amount of patches and updates that when you build a palace your city troops actually get DOWNGRADED (if your building the palace after being declared an emperor, which let's face it, if you're building the palace sooner than that, you're probably doing something wrong).

If you enjoy strategy and can bare to delegate every battle, then this game still has saving grace; but if you enjoy turning the tides on close battles or reducing casualties from battles by playing them yourself, this Total War game has fallen a long way....I honestly don't feel like cavalry is even cavalry at times any more.

These are just the most recently glaring issues I've had with this game.  It all worked much better before the updates, but now it's just getting unbearable.  I do hope Rome Remastered comes fully stocked and un-needing of countless add-ons and updates; as out of all the Total War series, that one has felt the most polished."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"!! Watch the 2010 Three Kingdoms series on YouTube before/while playing this !!
Total War fans may find the unit types basic and the mostly land maps a little samey.
That being said, the diplomacy and character-based campaign are well worth your time if you are a fan of TW strategy  or the Three Kingdoms era.
The overworld economy and faction subsystems can be difficult to understand at first, even overwhelming in the first 5-10 hours.
Watch a few guide videos on building trees and you'll be fine.
You'll develop relationships and vendettas with factions in a way I haven't quite experienced since Medieval Total War. 
Really enjoyed playing as Cao Cao for 70 hours, especially while comparing the parallels and differences to the romanticised history/novel. 
Mandarin voice acting and artistic design is excellent as well. 
Strongly recommend!"
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"I good Total War game that has gotten better with patches. 

The campaign is among the finest in the series. The character and building mechanics make for interesting strategic play on the campaign map. There's strategically more than one way to skin a cat for most factions.

Diplomacy is the best it has ever been in the Total War series as the AI makes intelligible but sometimes unexpected moves. 

I only have two complaints:

1. The DLC isn't as varied as other Total War games. More often than not, it introduces a new start time in the same story but at different plot points. If you're a fan of the subject matter, you love it. Me? I see no reason to drop $10 so I can play Sun Ce or Lu Bu at some different point along the timeline. 

(Mandate of Heaven is pretty cool though). 

2. The battles and recruitment system kinda suck compared to other titles. Heroes render few perceptible changes to their troops while on the battlefield, but as duelists, red herrings, and ammo sponges they work wonders. They've become the centerpiece of battles without any real means to counter them (except other heroes). 

Not my cup of tea, but your mileage may vary. 

All in all this is a great strategy title to get on sale. I'd probably enjoy the battles some too if I didn't spoil myself with other titles."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,One of the most unique historical Total War games.
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"I waited to write this review as I was a tad unimpressed with 3 Kingdoms when it was released, but they kept promising updates. Now that updates, DLCs and other features are fleshed out...this is a fantastic Total War game! The options in this game shows how (hilariously) bad Total War Warhammer 1/2 are in their current forms. 

- Want to hire pirates to invade your neighbors? Go for it...
- Want to hire Mercs (or play as the Mercs) to fight for you? I had someone pay me $10k to go fight someone, then that someone offered me $15k NOT to fight them. Suddenly I am rich (and laughing)!
- Want to build buildings that will annoy your neighbors with negative perks? I will steal all your people via migration! 
- Political intrigue ranges from telling the Emperor to get stuffed, target someone you don't like or make the world mad! 
- You can have Governors, People on assignment and other things to Buff your armies, cities or factions (or do negatives to enemies). 
- Can send spies to rival factions. Now this is a mini-game in itself. You can get your spy hired as a General, a Governor or even in the Faction Council. Then you can cause ALL sorts of havoc from within! I opened the gates, poisoned a well or leaked marching orders. I also gave myself an entire city because...well...I was the Governor. But this can also happen to you! Think your general is loyal? Whoops...

AI has improved and can challenge you in some fights. Don't have archers? Well...you might want to charge immediately or they will sit at a safe distance till they run out of ammo. Think your archers are safe? They will try to find a way to ride around your lines and slaughter them. 

Warhammer had 0 unit options other than heroes. So you just have a scrum and wait to see who wins. Now you can spear wall, shield wall, advanced formations or do a mix. Just depending on the terrain and opponent.  My archers can swap between Regular arrows, poison or fire...depending on the army. In Warhammer you had to specifically make those units. 

Options...options to play different with different factions is fantastic. 

Cons:
Oh, it isn't perfect. Shogun 2 Fall of the Samurai is likely still the high watermark. 
- Keeping Generals happy early on is a frustrating mini-game. 
- Gatehouses or Passes are generally pointless. You can't close the door to deny access and the AI never attacks them. I had one fully upgraded and an army inside as 3 enemies came at me. I was prepared to lose that army in a tough siege battle defense to give me time. Nope..they just rode past. 
- Some factions are awesome and others are very meh...Cao Cao is sometimes too OP. I'd like to see Lu Bu at least once be a major force. 
- Naval fights? We haven't had boats since Shogun 2? Can we have boats back, please? I miss ramming, shooting or starting a boat on fire. Did Sega fire all their Naval people? I also miss Naval Invasions...landing with boats inside the walls was great! 
- Some of the buttons aren't well advertised. Assignments or Titles are buried somewhere...and real small. This could be explained or shown better. 

But if you want a true Total War experience. Get a friend and play as the Yellow Turbans. Buckle up...as that is a brutal one to survive as everyone hates you and doesn't stop coming! 

Cheers!"
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"The game itself is pretty decent though it has several major flaws.

- When reinforcing my armies are directly next to each other and yet on the battle map my reinforcements will often come from behind the enemies back line.

- The battle map often does not reflect where i am positioned, my army is on an open field or bridge and yet i will get forest maps. in fact it seems nearly every other map is a light forest, so forget bringing any anti infantry artillery.

- Skirmish mode is broken, if you don't pay attention for a brief moment your skirmishers will occasionally run into or not run away from combat even with skirmish enabled.


Though there are other bugs those are major ones, making it feel like any tactical movement on the world map is essentially pointless."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"Keeps crashing at unpredictable timings (during map phase, in battle or transiting to a battle) with no clear fix which makes me frustrated and try to quick save at every occasion."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"This game is fantastic. WHEN IT WORKS. Every single time I try to load a battle it crashes. I have tried every graphical setting possible and SEGA's response was to have me uninstall and reinstall windows and to wipe my HDD. Not gonna happen. I'm running a Corsair ONE, RTX 2080, i9 9900k, 32 gb ram, a separate boot SSD, and a 2 GB mechanical HDD. This is a coding issue that SEGA refuses to resolve."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"like playing dynasty warriors but its total war
"
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"If you like Total War games, I can't urge you enough NOT to buy this garbage!

In 2021, Full HD is going away and higher resolutions are becoming standard, yet this game is so poorly optimized even 2 years after it's release that it can only manage a measly 30 FPS average on UWQHD resolution with RTX3070 on high settings. Even though the game recommends my system to use Ultra preset settings, running the in-game benchmark results in an average of 25 FPS. This is pathetic.

On top of this, there are issues such as if you have a second keyboard language installed and  set to that language, the game softlocks itself, continues to run but becomes completely unresponsive to input. This problem persists if you change your keyboard language back, and even if you restart the game! A complete reboot seems to be the only fix. Sometimes, the game starts and simply won't respond to mouse clicks, but the cursor still moves.

Then, there's in game showstopping bugs, even after 2 years since release. I was playing as the emperor in the early campaign and they start with an incredibly terrible economy, which is fair enough, but after 5 turns in or so, the money runs out, and there is nothing you can do to improve it. That's not even the problem. The problem is that the game refuses to let you go bankrupt, so it will not allow you to end the turn with 0 money, but will instead open up the diplomacy window because it mistakenly thinks I am paying 50 gold to every other faction in the game, which I was not. So it was asking me to cancel payments that didn't exist, and thus blocking me from ending the turn and continuing the campaign. Now, maybe this could be prevented with some very clever financial and political decisions from turn 1, for example if you fire all your court members, so they won't draw salary from the treasury... but most players won't know about this kind of thing.

So in conclusion, this game is poorly optimized and has an abundance of technical issues, not to mention it looks 10 years older than it is. It is NOT for you if you are one of the following.
[list]
    [*]Not using 1080p resolution or lower
    [*]Have a second language installed in Windows
    [*]Using two monitors at the same time because the game does not trap the cursor
    [*]Like good looking games, because honestly TW: Shogun II still looks better and has better animations
    [*]Does not have GPS-like coordination, because there are tiny UI elements EVERYWHERE
    [*]Someone who enjoyed previous TW games, because this one overhauls so many things that already worked
[/list]"
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,CA has kept one thing consistent since Total War Rome. Crashing.
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"It's just really boring. Every war feels the same and the AI are predictable and uninteresting to play against.  Furthermore, the dlc content is a rip off and the majority of it should be included in the base game."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,Great Game.
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"Fun game, until it starts crashing all the time and never gets fixed."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"Total War: Three Kingdoms is set in the titular period that most of us probably know from Dynasty Warriors.

The Good:
+Probably the most aesthetic game of the franchise. Everything from menus to cinematics.
+Interesting new setting is well-presented and sticks to the formular.
+Diplomacy has never been better, hopefully this system will be carried onward to all new titles.
+The romance option and legendary duels do feel pretty natural on the battlefield.

The Bad:
-Feels like a heavy case of style over substance. The menues have never been worse.
-This in turn carries over to battles, where so much information has been curbed for a 'cleaner' look.
-Despite unique faction features, the clans all feel so very similar.
-The new recruitment and supply systems slows the early game down immensely.

Bottom Line:
TW: Three Kingdoms is not bad, but it is a mediocre entrance in a series with great games. If you are really into the setting, get it on sale."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"I've been a long-time dabbler in the Total War series.  Three Kingdoms, for me, has had the highest ""replayability"" of the entire series.  From the artwork, to the music, to the storyline, to the gameplay dynamics (all hail Lu Bu), Three Kingdoms is the ultimate sticky game experience.

The DLCs have also been on point and have made what was even out of the box an immerse game just out of this world.  With nearly 1000 hours played since 2019, I highly recommend this game to fans of turn-based strategy."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"My first Total War game was Shogun: Total War (2000), the original title in the series. I poured countless hours into it, followed by Medieval, Rome, Medieval II, Rome II, and so on. I played many of the titles which followed up to Attila, and I've even dumped a fair amount of time into Warhammer and Warhammer 2.

Here's the bottom line for me: Three Kingdoms is one of the best games in the 21+ year history of the franchise, hands down. It's one of the most balanced and polished experiences overall, with a fair amount of technical complexity, but mechanics that are approachable and easy to learn. Battles in Three Kingdoms feel similarly easy to enjoy, riding a line between strategic complexity and fun accessibility. The strategy map UI features some dramatic changes that take getting used to, but they're good overall: the updates feel geared towards refining an approach that had gotten messy and stale over the decades. It's slick and it makes sense.

Ultimately, I'm looking for a Total War experience that expertly rides a line - I want depth, historical immersion and complexity, but I also want to a polished experience that I can enjoy with ease. There are Total War games which lean harder into the former (at the expense of refinement and accessibility); there are titles which feel overly-streamlined and almost arcade-like. I love the franchise, but in truth, it's been a while since I've landed on a Total War game that strikes the right balance for me.

Three Kingdoms, by contrast, is my Goldilocks Total War. It's what I'm looking for. Deep but not byzantine. Accessible but not dumbed-down. Beautiful, rich and immersive - and most of all, fun."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"Alright alright, so i mean, its total war so like, ill always buy it, right? im a sucker, i just am. And i will make like a little list of my opinions on this game.
Pros=
-Beautiful gameplay
-immersive storyline
-the ability to switch between playing a more usual total war game or a more dynasty warriors esque (generals are op af) type of game, which i enjoy. 
-Many different units for each given faction
Cons=
-Extremely confusing/steep learning curve
-Bad things happen randomly, and not like in other total wars where theres the occasional earthquake or famine. like, lose 50% of ur food/money production for the next 10 turns kinda bad. and its always random, u can be +4000 and in surplus food one day than next day ur -17 food and hemmoraging money. its pretty wild

all in all its DEFINITELY a challenging game. little bit of a hair puller if u ask me but its OKAY, i guess conquoring china isnt easy for anyone :o"
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,game is pogu
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,feels like the least fun total war game out of the series i have played
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"This was a splendid game when I bought it, when it first came out. But to my dismay, with every DLC that has been released, the game has become considerably WORSE.
My favourite faction, Zheng Jiang, became a cripple when it's reform tree was raped to become a stupid mess you really dont want to waste any time on dealing with.
Most of the new factions that are released with the DLCs are completely useless, while a couple of them are stupidly strong by default, thus it seems they try to create an incentive to spend money on the DLC. (Yes I am talking about you Zhurong). 
The storyline and it's characters were very interesting in the beginning and they interacted with each other in a way I found lovely, harmonious, every faction had it's niche and it's unique characters and their stories, conquests, defeats etc. While the new ones are still ""unique"", they threw everything out of balance.
Dong Zhuo is a mere joke now, but in face of the jungle tribes after the year 200 everything is.
If a dev is greedy and let's you play just 1/4 of his game for the full price because of nowadays common dlc practice, that's fine with me, as long as the game is still playable for people who dont buy them. Not to mention the new useless mechanic that was introduced (imperial favor), the fact that AI sucks, the UI is somewhat complicated and the ""help"" you get is just more confusing than anything... The fact that units wont do what you tell them to sometimes is almost standard by now (walking instead of attacking with ranged weapon, inability to lay out path for a unit that is not a straight line, icons lighting up wrongly) and you can read about these things in a lot of other reviews below.
If you like strategy games in which devs feel like they can alter core mechanics on the go, along with releasing p2w content, then this game is for you.
As it doesn't seem that commonplace DLC practice will die down any time soon, I seriously doubt I will ever buy a game from you ever again.
Edit: I'm trying to give it a 2nd chance but only to see the game crash *multiple times* when playing as a specific faction."

The continued faction reworks, addition of character art, and new features even two years after release keeps me coming back for more."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"Three Kingdoms is simply a gorgeous looking game and runs surprisingly smooth for how demanding it looks.

The improvements to diplomacy makes other total wars feel lacking once you get used to this system so we can only hope they carry over a bunch of mechanics from this and keep them in future titles.

It may be difficult to get into at the start since mechnically it's quite different and if you aren't familiar with the time period and the big figure names you may struggle, but once you invest the time to learn these 2 things you will begin to enjoy it and appreciate the game much more."

Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"Put plenty of hours into a dozen different total war games and I LOVED 3 Kingdoms. It feels like the devs are making really active strides to improving systems that have plagued the games for a long time. The thing that really put me head over heels was the mid / late game. It felt like other factions were truly building up at the same speed I was. I never hit a critical mass where I simply had to conquer enough minor governments to eventually win, like a 20 hour victory lap. Instead, from beginning to end, there were enemies of my size or greater who were actively trying to bring me down. There were moments where I did everything I could do defend my capital fielding 6 full stacks. It was a blast. As a long time fan I played on records mode, but I just finished my first campaign and I'm about to check out some mods and dive in for my second in romance.

Many of the systems improved upon in this game show an understanding of the problems these games have faced since their inception. It really feels like CA is on the right track and this makes me so excited for games to come. Couldn't recommend it enough."
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"I'm a huge fan of the Three Kingdoms Era in China so for me it's one of the better Total War Games I've played.  Shogun was my first total war game and I've played them all with medieval 2 and Attila being my 2 favorites.
There's some fair points that it can get a bit repetitive but that imo is the point to the delegate system.  You can move past the smaller insignificant battles.
I like how generals works and the campaign and diplomacy are vastly improved from previous titles.
Some people complain about the units not being diverse enough, but I disagree.  I thought the units in Warhammer Total War were getting out of hand.  I'm glad to be playing this style again.

Anyways, good graphics, better campaign, three kingdoms, it's good so far.
"
Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"Can't recommend to old school TW fans. I am sure many people will love this game, but for me it's too much fantasy. Combat aspect is not fun for me at all. TW went a different direction after WH, and it makes sense they have a huge fan following after those titles. I just don't think they will ever go back to making titles like Rome 1, shogun or even r2. Now my hopes are with Knights of Honor II.  Goodbye TW."

It has its drawbacks (I'm not a fan of the tower defense or the rock-paper-scissors strategy in battles) but my big hangup was that it didn't ""feel"" like a Total War game. Having played it for a bit, I can now say that I like the differences. I like the focus on characters and I really enjoy the Romance mode.

Still not a big fan of the rock-paper-scissors strategy but oh well.

Worth getting!"

Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"I raided the muslim controlled island of Crete. As I go to ransom my prisoners I notice a 1 year old girl has died in my dungeons, and as it just so happens she was infected with the bubonic plague.

I quickly mass execute all my muslim prisoners as damage control, but it's too late. The plague spreads like wildfire through my court, infecting me and many of my family. My court physician tries his best, but it's not enough. Eventually my character has given up the ghost, and with him goes the dream of a united north sea empire, all because of a tiny muslim girl from Crete.

Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"TL:DR if you have a way to play CK2 with most or all of the DLC: do that. Everything we love about Crusader Kings is there. The same cannot be said about CK3.

Generally does a good job of improving the more broken aspects of CK2. The stress mechanic is a nice improvement. No longer are you and half the kingdom burdened with the omnipresent 'stressed' trait. Re-vamped religions are nice. Sins and virtues depend on the faith's tenets; being wrathful is no longer a sin for warmongering faiths. Bloodlines are also re-done as a skill tree. Granted, I enjoyed the chaotic nature of CK2 bloodline founding a bit more.

As stated earlier, quite a bit of the content in CK2 isn't there in CK3. Gone are Viceroyalties, Merchant Republics, trade zones, China, artefact treasuries, secret societies, unique Nomad/Islamic/Byzantine governments and play styles. Not to mention all the nice little touches. Execution sound effects are gone, as is the gilded frame around your portrait proclaiming your status (or lack thereof). The combat system is dumbed down to an absurd degree. Flanking, tactics, morale, and even army composition have been dropped in favor of a purely numbers based system. I'm not trying to say it was all perfect in CK2, but dropping things to this degree seems to be a bit much.

I'm not a big fan of the UI style, either. It honestly feels like I'm playing a fan mod for Civ 5. 3D characters instead of 2D portraits was a nice idea, but almost-real characters who cycle through the same idle animations only worsens the Civ 5 vibe. The map is bad. Bright fluorescent colors and poor borders definition make it hard to find who you are actually at war with. Doubly so in areas that are a mess of fractured enclaves and duchies (read: most places). Expect to march your army into the wrong country at least once. Zoom based context sensitive clicking is a constant annoyance that only grows over time. The only way to select individual counties is to zoom all the way in. The aforementioned UI makes it impossible to discern individual counties at that zoom level. This was enough to make me quit.

To top it all off, you can fully customise your 3D character, but NOT their family coat of arms. The one thing common for every character in your dynasty is decided completely at random. 

Granted, most of this will likely be fixed with DLC at some point. Possibly mods. Hopefully the bugs I've encountered will get ironed out as well. But that's besides the point, isn't it? When I purchased CK3, I was under the full impression that Paradox were building a Crusader Kings game that fixed all the things we hated in CK2, while expanding the things we loved. CK3 is a disappointing partial delivery in this regard. Some things were improved. Many things were left out. New problems were introduced. As I mentioned at the start; play fully upgraded CK2 if you can."

Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"This review is aimed at people who played CK2:

CK3 is still lacking many features that are part of CK2 and its dlcs. The number of events are far fewer and I would still say that CK2 offers the better gameplay experience. BUT CK3 is a great base to build upon. In the future, CK3 will probably become a much better game. And at the moment, QoL, UI, graphics and even balancing are much better than in CK2."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"This is the most complex and impressive games I've ever seen. The MANY mechanics are very well thought and implemented, and the game really makes you feel like a feudal lord to build your dynasty during up to 600 years! Politics, scheming, wars, you name it, this game has it... This game is so amazing that the only bad thing I have to say is that I can't change the keyboard inputs.
Don't think too much, just buy it... This game is amazing... Just be prepared to spend a long time on youtube learning the many complex mechanics, but I assure it's gonna be worth it.

Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"My king got really good at intrigue, and used that skill to murder his brothers and get their land. He then proceeded to rule his land like a tyrant, and if anyone even disliked him they got imprisoned or murdered. I imprisoned a kid once and kept him there until he was 16. Then when I started to get a bit bored I just decided to get him as stressed as possible and he ended up going insane. He then died shortly after, and his poor son had to inherit the whole kingdom which was now an absolute mess in the midst of a liberty war. Anyway good game if you want to violate freedom of speech and just human rights in general."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"This is by far Paradox's most fun and streamlined historical sim. You'll still be watching several hours of tutorial videos to make sense of it all, but the nice thing is you can jump in with one of the easy starts and still have a good time before you've learned all the mechanics. Incredibly, that accessibility comes without sacrificing any complexity, or rather, complexity has only been sacrificed in the right places, where it was mere redundancy and busywork. Really an excellent game, strong meme potential as well."

Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"Extremely good introductory title into the grand strategy genre or into paradox games in general. A near-perfect tutorial will ensure that you grasp all necessary mechanics that will allow you to go on and have successful campaigns. Many starting positions exists that range from chill and easy to extremely challenging yet equally rewarding. Many different play styles are available and varying levels of role-play may be achieved. There is some monotony in character design and outfits, and at times the game, game story-lines, and general feel may seem overplayed. Lots of potential and a great starting off point for a game that should live up to, and even pass, Crusader Kings 2's legacy. Would seriously recommend to anyone who likes history or strategy or even role-play/slice-of-life games."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"A very fun and accessible Grand Strategy Game with more of a focus on managing your realm and roleplay than war. The game does a great job of teaching you the mechanics of the game, but still sometimes has the problem of badly explaining certain details. The game also starts to show some cracks in variety and substance as you play for longer hours, making it extremely difficult to complete a full campaign.

We now have more DLC coming out for the game, and just the base game and 2 DLCs puts the price close to 90 USD. I do love this game, but honestly wait for the base game to go on sale for something like 30-40 USD. If you have CK2 with all the DLC, I would also recommend to wait for more content to come out for this game."

Alas, the newly crowned king was quite old and passed away just a few months. Never fear, the succession was secure in my son and grandson, and I had a sizable web of alliances, so I was confident that any difficulties with succession would be quickly smoothed out.

Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"What a game title this is!

Crusader Kings III is one heck of a title, even by Paradox's standards. It remains true to some of the core facets of Crusader Kings II whilst aiming for one thing above all else, user-friendliness. Whilst this is still a Paradox game, and this is still a Grand Strategy title meaning that it is far from simple to learn. Crusader Kings III does a lot to help you learn it, which makes a pleasant change.

It is actually surprisingly easy to pick up and simply start playing, whilst the random nature of the events can have you playing this game for hours, sometimes you will be trying to build an empire while it feels like everything in the game is truly against you, sometimes the stars align and all your ploys come to fruition.

If you've ever played a Civilisation game wishing for more complex diplomatic and strategic decisions, then this IS the title for you.

Also it is worth noting that the character editor is powerful enough to create THE Nigel Thornberry, so you know. Bonus points there."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,The Dynasty Mechanics are probably the most enjoyable for me. Just spread your dynasty into the second in the line of as many kingdoms and duchies as possible while using intrigue to ensure your dynasty takes over... Conquer a large area in the mean time.
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"Paradox have managed to create yet another grand addiction/strategy game and how they have not yet been added to the DEA's top wanted list is mystery to me with the life breaking addictions they push onto people. I showed my friend and he binged it for 36 hours on his first playthrough.

11/10 would get addicted again"
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"Great game, not as complicated as other Paradox games. i think its a good beginners game for the paradox global strategy genre
Good Tutorial which explains everything you need to know to get started but you just need to play and make mistakes to learn how to do it the right way.

Strategy - Roleplay mix. Your King is a real person and can die and if people dont like you there might be an revolution. Its not only about war and you have to manage your empire as well (vassals, religion, culture, etc..).

Lacks some in-depth features after you understood the basics and in the late game it becoms more of a ""colour the map"" and there is not much else to do besides war after you established your empire and have everything under control"
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"After a long line of successful Andalusian counts, dukes, and eventually kings who had built upon the legacy of their fathers, the Aftasid dynasty was prepared for its greatest trial yet: The mad first Caliph Ali, guided by his most trusted grand vizier who had told him so much of the grandeur of his domain, declared a jihad for Sicily. The sixteen thousand brave fighters of Allah were no match for the united force of all christendom. Trapped on Sicily, five thousand men were slaughtered at the gates of Palermo. Running in the hills of the apennines, faithful soldiers were cut down man by man. In the first and second battles of Venice, when all hope was rested on the last few thousands of men, Andalusia lost almost all her remaining forces. Ali locked himself in his chambers.

As the European dignitaries forced his hand into agreeing to a surrender, all of Andalusia waited patiently, not yet willing to give up the dream of a greater Caliphate. But as pressure mounted, the first Caliph fell apart. Loved ones, dead. Friends, dead. Countrymen, dead. Everyone was dead. Everyone, everyone, was dead. In his last few days the peasants rose up in Galicia, the Moroccans raided the Maghreb territories, and, having no more patience for anything, he didn't listen even to his grand vizier. Caliph Ali, thinking no one was beside him, resigned. Some say he died soon after, as he was nearing sixty, while others say he fled to the Canaries, but none can say for sure.

After ""his"" Caliph had broken under the pressure, the grand vizier revealed himself to have been an Isma'ili Shi'ite the whole time.

(This is a recount of a recent CK3 multiplayer game, the best one we've done yet)"
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"When this game first came up, I was right in line to buy it. But then I saw the free version, Crusader Kings 2. I thought to myself, ""Well, that one's free, I should just play it before I decide to spend money on this."" I loved it. I spent so much time playing it. Then my friends urged me to get this, Crusader Kings 3. So I did. I came here expecting CK3 to be a simply re-textured version of CK2. But boy, was I wrong. Crusader Kings 3 was so much better. Not only were the graphics incredibly good for what the game is, but the increased amount of functions and details is astounding. This is way more than worth the cost. The sheer amount of hours you can play this game, going through different scenarios, each grander than the last. Oh, and there is also the amazing mods that this game has in the workshop. Well worth the few KBs per mod."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"As good as the second one, but with completely new mechanics even without any of the DLC and patches the previous one had. I am really looking forward for its patches and DLC's, the game  have a lot of opportunities to expand. 10/10"
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"at it's core, it's still Crusader Kings and still a great game and system.    It's based on small interactions between medieval lords; interactions that interweave with eachother to form complex web that drives forward the history of the game world and all the conflicts and intrigues within, making a fascinating game for those who can get involved with their characters.   Those looking for  a war game or an empire builder like Civ may wish to look elsewhere.

 Compared to its predecessor CK3 lacks a bit of depth as well as variety.  CK2's non-christian factions are more fleshed out, and there's alot of cool features like socities, artifacts (though a ck3 mod fixes this a bit) and others.   What CK3 does excel in is being much more intuitive than the previous title as well as more story/rp focused.  particularly the latter point makes this a ton of fun to play for me despite not having as many features in CK2.  I believe what is currently here is a fantastic base, and in a few years this game has the potential to easily surpass ck2.  if you're a new player I'd probably recommend this as a starting point.   worth checking out as a returning player too, though if you have all the main DLC you may wish to wait for a sale."

I've had mighty emperors rule over Swedish India/Asia, and been the nicest overweight cannibal to rule Africa ever. So many ways to play this game, and most of them end up in situations you can't discuss in public."

Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"Interesting game at start, but once you get down to it you can just repeat same patterns to win. And regardless of game time, the constant events popping up become veeery repetitive and sometimes you can't even do anything about them. Late game becomes boring with how slowly a massive empire can do things, not to mention if someone rebels (Which they will.) you're powerless to stop them due to numbers and no allies if you cover over half the map. The fact that new content you need to buy to find new things in the game is even less inspiring, seeing the initial price + expansion packs prompts up the price quickly."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"Seems like Paradox does not intend to stop with the exploitative and greedy DLC policy. I do not recommend at all: this game will end up like EU4 where you have to give Paradox hundreds of euros/dollars if you want the actual full experience and not the lackluster hollowed out base game.

"
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"Played CKII for about 600 hours and even with all the DLC i have to say CKIII is truly wonderful.

Theres a few changes to how certain rules work, but none of them are annoying.
The ""tech"" (culture) system is good, the personal lifestyle is just magnificent and it really emphasizes the focus on characters.

The AI is also quite intelligent, when you're fighting against them. I did not find a way how to control AI effectively (such as giving orders). I only found that when allies are around your main armies they just follow you around.

Playing as a count is interesting because you have little resources and have to use your charm.
Playing as a duke gives you a little bit more resources but allies are extremely important else you just get F-ed by lords with allies.
Playing as a king resembles the duke but you just have more vassals to manage.
Once you reach emperor rank you reach the tipping point and can start to snowball. If you can keep your vassals in check (for which you need multiple tools to do so) there's no stopping you.

Brilliant grand strategy game (also played EU4 and stellaris for ~1400h each, so i have seen more of paradox and CK3 is just great!)"
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"Absolutely love how addicting, engaging and surprisingly educational this game is. The first two points are easy to understand and I am sure others will go more into it. The gameplay can be hard to figure out at the beginning but once you do you are hooked and always want to come back to try a different ruler, region, era, etc. But what I love about it the most is how much I've learned about history. Yeah, Icelandic tribes didn't conquer Ireland and France doesn't fall apart every two decades in real life, however core game mechanics like claims, duchy management, family ties, marriages, etc can actually be used similar to how they were used in real life. I wouldn't call it a history simulator of course but now every time I watched a history documentary or movie, I find myself saying ""I should try that in CK3!"" It is also an amazing tool to learn geography. Most of us get a year or two in it in school but with CK3 it's literally half the game to understand know where kingdoms are. Definitely recommend it if you are a love of history! If you don't, try it out anyway. It's worth it just for the crazy situations that end up happening (looking at you Swedish factions in the Iberian Peninsula.)"
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,I loved CK2 and wasn't sure if this would be just a bit of a makeover.  It's not it's a significant improvement even before the DLC starts arriving.
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"The first game I bought on Steam, and the best strategy game I ever played."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,Your GAME NEVER WORKS AFTER A UPDATE!!!
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"While I really like this game, a problem I am currently having that a lot of other people seem to be having is that the game launcher is not working. Unlike other people, restarting my pc, reinstalling the game, letting the launcher update, and other such fixes don't seem to work. Until this is improved, I would not recommend the game, as you just cannot play it if your launcher ends up not working at random."

To remove lag
And setup this autohotkey script so that you dont have to use arrow keys to look around
#Ifwinactive ahk_exe W40k.exe
w::up
a::left
s::down
d::right
up::w
left::a
down::s
right::d
And this so the game will run in 1080p

And get this so you can actually zoom out far enough to actually see what you are doing(if you want to use it in the base game actually works fine just install it in Dawn of War Gold\W40k\Data instead of where it tells you to put it.)

*My time played isn’t accurate, I had a physical version of this game in the past and have put more towards 80-100hrs into it and the DLCs. Though this review is very much focused on the base game.

The intro – Yes, the opening cinematic deserves a mention. As with pretty much all GamesWorkshop offerings cinematics are not afterthoughts, and I think DoW was the first one. I love this opening, it still looks good, it gets you pumped to play the game, good bit of action right before you get to take charge yourself.

The Graphics – Writing this review in 2021, lets immediately remember this game came out in 2004. A LOT has changed in graphics since then. Are they dated, yes, does that destroy the enjoyment, not really. When playing this shows in some of the scenery the units still look quite good when you’re zoomed out, the in mission cutscenes however do show how old the graphics are though.

The Story – I liked the story, it was done well and made you feel like you were building towards something uncovering a big secret, even if the missions were at that core the same rinse n repeat. 😊

The gameplay – 
- Build a small firebase, capture control points, hold em, take the enemies points, blow up their base. Simples.
- There was a bit of rock paper scissors going on with units, and it could nicely be tipped in your favour with Unit upgrades.
- The maps are often commented to be a little small certainly in Skirmish, but that wasn’t always the worst thing as your unit count wasn’t huge, powerful units were your goals in this rather than a zerg rush.
- There was purpose to using the map to your advantage, shell holes provided cover, though things like elevation aren’t a thing.

Value for money?
Current retail price is £9.99… That is too much for such an old game. Now based on my Beer to Time ratio, I think if you’d get your money’s worth if you played the campaign, you’d need to get about 3 hours out of it I think that’s easily doable. But a tenner for such an old game feels wrong.

Chuck this in your wishlist if you are a 40k fan, it’ll show up in a seasonal sale soon enough."

"Warhammer® 40,000: Dawn of War® - Game of the Year Edition",Strategy,4570,"A fun game that has certainly held up well over the years. Easy to learn and fun to master, the only complaint about this is the lack of more factions in the base game, only giving you four but the expansions easily fix that issue."
