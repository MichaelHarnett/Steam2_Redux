Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"Absolutely garbage servers and net-code for public game play! This is a high level competitive game in 2021 and Valve has completely lost touch with modern technology. This could be a much better experience for players if Valve would invest some of it's billions back into functioning servers and the community instead of milking it's customers with minimal return when those customers made Valve what they are today. Outdated 64 tic rate on servers, de-synchronization, archaic net-code, and glaring imbalance is commonplace in this game. If you want to play a game that makes you hate yourself almost as much as you hate the tease this game is, go ahead and waste your time playing this game and fooling yourself into thinking skill matters and you'll get better with time. If I were to imagine Hell, the perfect analog would be someone trapped playing this game on an endless loop."

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"After putting a decent amount of time into this game I have come to find that is all in all an enjoyable game to play(especially so with friends). As far as playing games go I have always liked playing competitive fps' as I find they are fun to learn and it is satisfying to do well as much as it is fun to win in ranked. The skill threshold for this game is sufficiently high while you can still play it casually and enjoy it if you don't mind getting destroyed by the occasional smurf every now and then. if you want to improve however this is the easiest way to do so.

-Learn recoils for different weapons.(workshop maps are amazing for this)
-Learn nades( pop flashes, smoke and molly lineups etc)
-Up to preference but as I'm still learning all the maps I stick to one or two maps when I play before switching  to another once I'm confident on that map and can remember smokes and where to play.
-Watch pro league watching better people play can help you learn how to play.
-Youtube videos on how to play are good but I mainly just recommend watching them for nade lineups and good positions to play.
-As good as trying to play like a pro like stewie2k sounds just make sure to remember what works for pros might not necessarily work for you as you probably don't have the game knowledge or aim that they have i.e. as cool as being like the smoke criminal may sound rushing through t smoke when you're ct probably isn't the greatest idea.(unless you have REALLY good aim in which case who knows it might work out for you.)

Solid 10/10 game if you have good trust factor and time to sink into it."

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"Valve I love you, but wtf is that new update, you're essentially making the game pay to play, I know you're doing this to reduce cheaters and smurf but there has to be a better way to fix this problem, you're just making this almost dead game into a dead game. I'm writing this not because i hate the game, I love this game, I've been playing CS from CS 1.6 to CSGO and I want this game to be popular again, so for now I'm gonna say that for the newcomer you better off playing valorant than CSGO until valve fix the new update.

(sorry if there's any misspelling or weird writing, english is not my first language)"

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,There are no hackers in this game. Trust me
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"Mixed feelings.

Gameplay-wise one of the best shooters ever, with an unbearable amount of cheaters and a not so great community.

just go to aimware.net to catch up to the competition because as soon as you get in game, someone on the other team will spin bot the entire game whilst his entire team are laughing in chat.

100% nobody at valve plays this game and or gives a sh!t about it."

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"With the most recent update I kinda want to rest my case with CSGO via a review. 

The game is pretty much a basic 5v5 search and destroy game that requires practice, effort, and teamwork to succeed. However the only experience I've really gotten in the end was toxicity & some teamwork. I wouldn't take the game to serious because its a game. 

The battles are hit or miss between adrenaline filled & getting shot by a guy with a one shot weapon across the map. And although there are only a small handful of guns they could be taken with many different strategies (like sniping with a shotgun). However majority of gunfights will either consist of AK's, M4's, & AWP's. 

An occurring problem for folks is that there's an outbreak of hackers. I've had a handful of them I've went against. Rather instead of Valve fortifying there system they just made the entire ranking system premium only. Now if you want to ruin someones day it'll cost you 15.99 USD (+tax). But now the new players have to deal with the folks locked out with the pay wall. Scaring them off. 

But at this point the main focus of the game is Micro-Transactions. immediately your met with a paywall if you want to get competitive with the game. Followed by the pretty skins that Valve add whenever they need an extra bit of cash. It feels like the game is less of a game and more of a Slot Machine with a game next to it. People get urges to unbox because of streamers, people lose their money, Valve gets it all, and it cycles. 

I took a brake in March of 2021 because I felt I was getting worse at it & was devoting almost 3/4 of my day to it. Now it's uninstalled, and is left as a scar on my life for the time I wasted on something that I'm never going to use again. 

At the end would I recommend CS:GO? With a clear mind I don't think so. Although the gameplay was fun at certain times the bads stack far over the goods."

This game is so fucking tedious, that even the Devs' try to force feed money cards, that if you buy you surely have mental issues because people can literally money drop for you. In every online game that a normal gamer has played, this is called hacking/cheating but because these half assed dev's who apparently don't give two shits, ""Modding"" is okay. You've killed your game to any true gamer that cares about progression, and I get its an old AF game. But some people have been playing MMO's, MOBA'S, etc for years and this is honestly so disheartening to play. I truly am glad I bought this on sale, this isn't a game 50% of the time.

This game is so fucking tedious, that even the Devs' try to force feed money cards, that if you buy you surely have mental issues because people can literally money drop for you. In every online game that a normal gamer has played, this is called hacking/cheating but because these half assed dev's who apparently don't give two shits, ""Modding"" is okay. You've killed your game to any true gamer that cares about progression, and I get its an old AF game. But some people have been playing MMO's, MOBA'S, etc for years and this is honestly so disheartening to play. I truly am glad I bought this on sale, this isn't a game 50% of the time. And the Dev's/Community should truly feel embarrassed."

Grand Theft Auto V,Action,271590,wouldnt bother playing unless you just wanna be trapped inside a cage by modders. i was stuck even after restarting the game i had to download a mod menu just to remove attached objects then get banned the next day its a joke unplayable due to modders that get away with it daily but god forbid you defend yourself against said modders absolute waste of money. now im stuck with a game i cannot refund and cannot play online rockstar are just money grabbing idiots who release the same game on every gen and then ban the people who want to play properly

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"I've been playing this game since release, and while I don't hate the game for what it is today, it has just lost the spark of that incredibly tactical and realistic feel. I'm not one to go ""new=bad"", and there were sci-fi elements on release (like Jager's anti-grenades, though they were all believable back then), but what I enjoyed about the game is gone at this point. You won't find the tactical shooter where every death massively changes the game and teamwork is essential to every step in a realistic feel, but a load of a million different traps you have to get around, memorizing what 50+ characters do to even be able to fight them, characters that their abilities feel like they're meant for a game (not an actual raid scenario), and devs pushing out power-creep characters, making the classics rarely used. (like seriously what did they do to thatcher?) It took them 6 years to make the most useless operator (Tachanka) into something good. Did they do this with other useless operators? Castle? Nope. Blitz? Buffed then destroyed by nerf. Alibi? Nope! Doc? Only useful in casual. Finka? Monty? Glaz? Lion? Doki doki? Warden? ANYONE?
No. But the new operator is going to be overpowered! Then nerfed 2 months in... (This has always been a problem)

The game isn't bad, but it's not what it was. Feels like 1 step forwards, 2 steps back with it. If you're unsure on whether to get the game, watch some streams (both old and new), and see if you like the new style it's gone to, but personally, I do not. I genuinely say though, check this game out. You may have a lot of fun with it"

With a strong mental focus towards the game you will have an incredible performance in your matches.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"With the hours i have (111) on PC and around 500 on console because my friends are on those platforms I can't recommend this game in the state its in even in the future and i'll list my reasons. The game is far from what it was 2017 - 2019 to now what made siege great was that it was a tactical military shooter fighting terrorists and all that, now we have operators that are completely sci fi it also has gotten really confusing with all these operators left right and centre its hard to keep track, another thing that stings is the removal of maps or reworking of maps without keeping the original and just removing it from existence. the ranked scene and even casual is even horrible with horrible teammates being completely toxic and never wanting to help anyone even new players team killing just because of a mistake don't get me wrong its funny as all fuck in casual or when you're just messing around but when you want to chill and play or even concentrate to play ranked it gets frustrating and makes you want to quit, you'll meet good people trust me I've met friends and still talk to them to this day. I'm going to mention another problem specifically the console which isn't a problem here  i ask ubisoft to at least contact microsoft and playstation of the MNK problem for consoles its gotten so horrendous that i can't even play casual anymore to just chill with my mates no word or anything has been said about the issue just "" Oh we don't condone it please don't do it"" But what does that achieve? Nothing and it'll only get worse making console player base get smaller and smaller of the people who just don't want to cheat or they'll cave and spend horrendous amount of money on a xim just to get good when the thing doesn't even mimic mouse movement correctly. 

I'll close out this review from a person who loved siege and played it religiously and got platnium twice i loved it for the fact it offered challenge where i was used to games like cod and overwatch where almost every move counted or you had to at least think of what you were doing instead of just roaming around shooting like a idiot this game told you  you "" this isn't cod don't treat it like it"" And let me tell you when i first started out it was hard i died almost every round but i was still having fun i loved this games community with tachanka jokes and annual events that i got excited for I've made amazing memories with this game with 1V5 and aces i don't write this review as a hater i write it as a person who loved siege and watched every singe trailer for new season i wish to see change though i doubt with how ubisoft treats its employees and the way they package their games as some lazy open world i doubt we'll see anything of that nature so for right now siege will be this hero sci fi shooter which has lost its identity."

Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"This game has been one that I have dreaded playing for a long time... While I had heard that the game was amazing and a true masterpiece of the FPS RPG Genre I must admit that the artstyle was something that left a sour taste in my mouth as the visuals were particularly not my favourite. However I lost a bet with a friend years ago and he told me that as compensation I had to buy this game and one day do a runthrough with him to truly see what a masterpiece this game was, so I purchased it but still hadn't played it for some time. Then my roommate saw that I owned it and asked if he could use my Steam to play it on my PC every so often, even bought all the DLC shortly afterwards (minus the Commander Lilith DLC that leads into Borderlands 3 which i still have yet to obtain) just so he could play it not far from me while I was chilling on my Playstation or Xbox... And the jokes about this game, all over my facebook and all over my youtube for years even to the point that friends of mine made references to this game in D&D games that I was the Dungeon Master for... It seemed I could not escape my fate from this game, and so finally... as of about 8 days ago... I bit the bullet, got three of my mates, one who hadn't played before either and two that had, and we finally did a runthrough...

Now of my 104 hours that the review says I will admit that about 60 of them are actually mine, and the artstyle still annoys the hell out of me to this day BUT the rest of the game? Well it more than makes up for the artstyle's aggravation as this game is fun, hilarious and just left me with too many moments of joy, laughter and WTF episodes and my only regret is that in all honesty I should have played this sooner... I should have been shooting skag's in the mouth just as I left Highschool, I should have been beating down Psycho Midgets well before I moved towns and I sure as hell should have been cracking Handsome Jack's smug skull in WELL BEFORE I started university... But alas my stubbornness and that deplorable artstyle truly got in the way of this otherwise gem in the rough.

So thank you friend of mine for making that bet with me and forcing me to give it an honest go, for the hilarious moments were truly great, thank you players of my games for making references from well written lines and characters from this fantastic game, thank you best friends for joining me on this great crusade through Pandora and helping me to see the fun, thank you 2K for getting this game to all the boys and girls who really wanna smash Psycho's in the wasteland and thank you Gearbox and their staff members for taking the time to make this game as amazing and enjoyable as it is (minus the artists, i'm sorry but I cannot give you any praise as I can never personally forgive the style personally).

Now if you'll excuse me... I'm probably going to sink another 100 hours into this game at the very least and even play all the other sequels, prequels and predecessors with my friends to make up for lost time.

Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"Waiting for steam summer sale to buy that last DLC for this game, so I decided to take a break from borderland 2 to play LRFF and a few other games. While waiting I decided to finish my review for this game first.

Some of the best games in my library I didn’t play yet because I am still missing DLC like Dishonored or Stellaris as I always want to try to get the full experience of a game before I move onto other backlogs in my libraries. Borderlands 2 has been burning a hole on my playlist for a long time because of missing DLCs. A lot friend told me to play with them for many years but without getting the DLC it just feels weird for me. 

Being released for a long time this game is still in very good Quality. Great map design, Story, funny dialogue with awesome voice acting and the little madness in everybody. The interface and gameplay itself are still high standard in today’s game world. Difficulty is a bit higher then needed as game is expected to be play with a bunch of friends. I recommend explore each map and do missions that’s at least 2 level below yours and keep it that way so you don’t have to die too much. 

Lucky for us there is skeleton chest that you can open with golden key you can find by searching internet. Upgrade your guns using that every 4-5 levels or so using it so you don’t have to depend on quest reward and loot drops. Currently there are about 230 keys still available to grab before they expire and they do release more from time to time.

I was unlucky enough that play through the entire game + 3 major DLC not a single legendary dropped for me but normal people does have better luck than I do. Ouch, I am going to go cry in a corner now and let’s finish this review quickly.

9.5/10 would be my final score for this game as a whole and once I have the last DLC I will play through the game again in new game+ and the other 3 major DLC that I haven’t touched yet. Recommend for anyone and everyone, if you haven’t play this get all expansion on a sale and play now, you need to know the entire Borderlands story as the whole series is going very strong and new games and new expansions are being made constantly. Adding Borderland 3 + all DLCs into my Wishlist right now.

The looter shooter that got me into the Borderlands universe. Among the witty one-liners, unique humor, intriguing story, and deep characters is some rather addictive gameplay. You can shoot bad guys. You can shoot your friends. You can shoot a gun that shoots guns that shoot your friends. Or bad guys. Sometimes the bad guys shoot each other. Sometimes the good guys shoot each other. The most handsome guy in the game is a bad guy. The most annoying character in the game is a good guy. There's a gun that screams. Like, vocal screaming. There are dudes that just scream in general. You can have all this just cause you feel like it.

Arguably the best entry to the Borderlands universe.

===[ $ Price Index: ]===
☑ Worth even MORE than full price
☐ Completely worth full price
☐ Wait for a sale
☐ Be prepared to refund this title
☐ No Man's Sky (Do not ever purchase this abomination to the gaming industry)

I frequently see this game on sale for like $5. Every time I see it on sale for that cheap, I literally look for people on my friends list to buy the game for (disclaimer: go away). That's how enjoyable the game is.

===[ ۞ Playtime/Replayability: ]===
☑ Highly replayable (> 250 hours)
☐ Long (100 ~ 250 hours)
☐ Average (50 ~ 100 hours)
☐ Short (10 ~ 50 hours)
☐ Minuscule (0 ~ 10 hours)

Do not mistake my Steam time for how replayable this game is. I have probably clocked hundreds, if not thousands of hours on just Borderlands 2 alone on the Xbox 360 for how fun it is to play with friends.

===[ ☀ Story: ] ===
☐ Masterpiece
☑ Memorable
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ None

In this age of kind of crappy storytelling, Gearbox can still deliver games with very engaging stories without sacrificing gameplay quality. That seems to be a rare commodity nowadays. You'll meet some recurring characters from the original Borderlands as well as brand new characters. To me, there isn't a single character where I'd rather not see them in the game. Each character is very well written, and they blend together to form one of the most interesting stories in modern entertainment. The only reason the story doesn't earn a Masterpiece rating from me is because it is a bit cliche. Good guys defeat bad guy and save the world. The path that the good guys take to defeat the bad guy is what's very engaging.

===[ ☼ Visuals/Graphics: ]===
☐ Masterpiece
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ Visual catastrophe
☐ Ask M. Night Shyamalan to make a movie of it

For a 2012 game, it still looks fantastic. Some of the animations definitely look outdated, but most of the time, you're paying attention to the plot more than anything so there's a good chance you'll miss the weird-ish animations.

===[ ♬ Sounds/Music: ]===
☐ Masterpiece (Beethoven is smiling in his grave)
☑ Memorable
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ Do not put your ears through this terror

The music is pretty good. There are little jingles and tunes here and there that you'll likely remember for a long time. The overall sound design is great quality, but doesn't exactly stand out against other games like NieR:Automata.

===[ ☣ Hardware Requirements: ]===
☐ A stone tablet should be able to run it
☐ Minimum
☑ Average
☐ High End
☐ Quantum Computing may not be enough

For some reason, my RTX 2080 Super is ""running out of video memory"" once or twice per session. That definitely has me raising an eyebrow, but the game runs flawlessly otherwise.

===[ § Bugs: ]===
☐ None to report
☑ Some, but still completely playable
☐ Several annoying bugs
☐ Unplayable

Generally the game runs as you would expect, but you'll also run into moments where you're like ""wtf just happened?"". If anything, these ""wtf"" moments add comedic value to the game which already has loads of comedic value.

===[ ❤ Audience: ]===
☐ Fetus (> 0)
☐ Toddlers (> 1)
☐ Children (> 4)
☑ Teenagers (> 13)
☑ Adults (> 18)
☑ Casual players
☐ Pro players

===[ ☼ Skill Level: ]===
☐ Better make this your day job
☐ Sweaty neckbeards galore
☑ Requires some effort
☐ Minuscule effort
☐ Just look at the screen and you win

===[ ✦ Miscellaneous: ]===
Gearbox maintains their own small social network that's tied to the Borderlands games, so you will have to make a SHiFT account to play any Borderlands game. You won't have to download any clients or anything; Gearbox did a pretty good job integrating the SHiFT service into their games.

Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"[h1]Best FPS game I've ever played![/h1]

The story is fun & enjoyable. Love the characters & personalities, the jokes, and stunning scenery of post-apocalyptic & steampunk combined. There are a lot of interesting quests like: you massacre every enemies or find treasures. The main characters are just awesome! They have different skills (don't forget the costumes!) so you can choose whatever character's skill do you like. I really like the weapons design, it's like every weapon is one of a kind.

Although the game was good, it has flaws. I [b]REALLY HATE[/b] the timed quest. I want to enjoy the game not speedrunning it. And the reward.. well.. not worth it.. I can't play co-op too, maybe because of the internet connection...

This game is awesome. Though old, but it still fun to play solo or with friends and has replay value. Buy the DLC too, it's worth it!

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Rating: 9/10"
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,i love this game
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,pure definition of fun. awesome game
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,full of borders
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,Played the heck out of this game on Xbox and PC. Takes all the awesome things about the first one and makes them even better. Think Rick and Morty if it was a looter shooter. And a DnD DLC? Awesome! A must cop!
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,hehe shoot me in the face
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"In spite of my overall recommended rating, there are some things that you should probably know about this game.
Firstly is the mechanism of the ""looter shooter"" part of the game. In order to actually farm for weapons and items, you have to re-enter a level from the main menu every single time; there is no boss respawn mechanic in levels, which makes this necessary part of the game sometimes incredibly frustrating. This is especially so when trying to get legendary loot.
There are mods (custom launchers) that fix this issue, but I shouldn't have to download a launcher - why isn't this part of the base game? It's a looter-shooter, how did they not expect people to need to farm the same boss or bosses over again? Thankfully for me, load times are amongst the shortest I've seen, but I know that will not be the case for everyone, which may make the experience even more gruelling. 

Another problem so far has been co-op play. The entirety of the way, I've been playing this with 3 other friends, which has made the experience considerably more difficult. How strange, given that this IS meant to be a co-op game. We frequently find ourselves underleveled for areas simply because playing in co-op splits the experience but doesn't adjust for 4 players. This sort of issue doesn't happen in singleplayer. Ironic.

My third and final gripe is the zer0 Sniper class, who I've been focusing on this entire time. I would briefly like to point out the stupidity of having a melee branch with no genuine melee weapons - asides from that, the Sniper class can feel quite redundant at times. Critical hitboxes are both small and in sometimes ridiculous places, or are totally not existent at all - and even when shot, do not crit properly. Many engagements are in close quarters, and when playing with 4 people, ""getting hurt"" animations can increase the difficulty in landing headshots.
I get this is going to be partially out of my own aim, but all the other factors can sometimes make Sniper Zer0 feel like a chore. 

As for the positives of this game...
+ The gunplay CAN feel amazing
+ There's an incredible addictiveness to getting good loot
+ Landing headshots CAN be satisfying
+ The game looks awesome even on the worst settings

So overall, I recommend it. Is it worth $20? Debatable, but I bought it only sale (only about $7) and I would say I'm satisfied with my purchase so far. I think fundamentally some of the game's design choices turned out to be poor, especially with so much DLC and the issues mentioned above; every game has it's flaws. 

In spite of those things, it is probably worth a try.

The looter shooter that got me into the Borderlands universe. Among the witty one-liners, unique humor, intriguing story, and deep characters is some rather addictive gameplay. You can shoot bad guys. You can shoot your friends. You can shoot a gun that shoots guns that shoot your friends. Or bad guys. Sometimes the bad guys shoot each other. Sometimes the good guys shoot each other. The most handsome guy in the game is a bad guy. The most annoying character in the game is a good guy. There's a gun that screams. Like, vocal screaming. There are dudes that just scream in general. You can have all this just cause you feel like it.

Arguably the best entry to the Borderlands universe.

===[ $ Price Index: ]===
☑ Worth even MORE than full price
☐ Completely worth full price
☐ Wait for a sale
☐ Be prepared to refund this title
☐ No Man's Sky (Do not ever purchase this abomination to the gaming industry)

I frequently see this game on sale for like $5. Every time I see it on sale for that cheap, I literally look for people on my friends list to buy the game for (disclaimer: go away). That's how enjoyable the game is.

===[ ۞ Playtime/Replayability: ]===
☑ Highly replayable (> 250 hours)
☐ Long (100 ~ 250 hours)
☐ Average (50 ~ 100 hours)
☐ Short (10 ~ 50 hours)
☐ Minuscule (0 ~ 10 hours)

Do not mistake my Steam time for how replayable this game is. I have probably clocked hundreds, if not thousands of hours on just Borderlands 2 alone on the Xbox 360 for how fun it is to play with friends.

===[ ☀ Story: ] ===
☐ Masterpiece
☑ Memorable
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ None

In this age of kind of crappy storytelling, Gearbox can still deliver games with very engaging stories without sacrificing gameplay quality. That seems to be a rare commodity nowadays. You'll meet some recurring characters from the original Borderlands as well as brand new characters. To me, there isn't a single character where I'd rather not see them in the game. Each character is very well written, and they blend together to form one of the most interesting stories in modern entertainment. The only reason the story doesn't earn a Masterpiece rating from me is because it is a bit cliche. Good guys defeat bad guy and save the world. The path that the good guys take to defeat the bad guy is what's very engaging.

===[ ☼ Visuals/Graphics: ]===
☐ Masterpiece
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ Visual catastrophe
☐ Ask M. Night Shyamalan to make a movie of it

For a 2012 game, it still looks fantastic. Some of the animations definitely look outdated, but most of the time, you're paying attention to the plot more than anything so there's a good chance you'll miss the weird-ish animations.

===[ ♬ Sounds/Music: ]===
☐ Masterpiece (Beethoven is smiling in his grave)
☑ Memorable
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ Do not put your ears through this terror

The music is pretty good. There are little jingles and tunes here and there that you'll likely remember for a long time. The overall sound design is great quality, but doesn't exactly stand out against other games like NieR:Automata.

===[ ☣ Hardware Requirements: ]===
☐ A stone tablet should be able to run it
☐ Minimum
☑ Average
☐ High End
☐ Quantum Computing may not be enough

For some reason, my RTX 2080 Super is ""running out of video memory"" once or twice per session. That definitely has me raising an eyebrow, but the game runs flawlessly otherwise.

===[ § Bugs: ]===
☐ None to report
☑ Some, but still completely playable
☐ Several annoying bugs
☐ Unplayable

Generally the game runs as you would expect, but you'll also run into moments where you're like ""wtf just happened?"". If anything, these ""wtf"" moments add comedic value to the game which already has loads of comedic value.

===[ ❤ Audience: ]===
☐ Fetus (> 0)
☐ Toddlers (> 1)
☐ Children (> 4)
☑ Teenagers (> 13)
☑ Adults (> 18)
☑ Casual players
☐ Pro players

===[ ☼ Skill Level: ]===
☐ Better make this your day job
☐ Sweaty neckbeards galore
☑ Requires some effort
☐ Minuscule effort
☐ Just look at the screen and you win

===[ ✦ Miscellaneous: ]===
Gearbox maintains their own small social network that's tied to the Borderlands games, so you will have to make a SHiFT account to play any Borderlands game. You won't have to download any clients or anything; Gearbox did a pretty good job integrating the SHiFT service into their games.

Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"[h1]Best FPS game I've ever played![/h1]

The story is fun & enjoyable. Love the characters & personalities, the jokes, and stunning scenery of post-apocalyptic & steampunk combined. There are a lot of interesting quests like: you massacre every enemies or find treasures. The main characters are just awesome! They have different skills (don't forget the costumes!) so you can choose whatever character's skill do you like. I really like the weapons design, it's like every weapon is one of a kind.

Although the game was good, it has flaws. I [b]REALLY HATE[/b] the timed quest. I want to enjoy the game not speedrunning it. And the reward.. well.. not worth it.. I can't play co-op too, maybe because of the internet connection...

This game is awesome. Though old, but it still fun to play solo or with friends and has replay value. Buy the DLC too, it's worth it!

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Rating: 9/10"
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,i love this game
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,pure definition of fun. awesome game
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,full of borders
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,Played the heck out of this game on Xbox and PC. Takes all the awesome things about the first one and makes them even better. Think Rick and Morty if it was a looter shooter. And a DnD DLC? Awesome! A must cop!
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,hehe shoot me in the face
Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"In spite of my overall recommended rating, there are some things that you should probably know about this game.
Firstly is the mechanism of the ""looter shooter"" part of the game. In order to actually farm for weapons and items, you have to re-enter a level from the main menu every single time; there is no boss respawn mechanic in levels, which makes this necessary part of the game sometimes incredibly frustrating. This is especially so when trying to get legendary loot.
There are mods (custom launchers) that fix this issue, but I shouldn't have to download a launcher - why isn't this part of the base game? It's a looter-shooter, how did they not expect people to need to farm the same boss or bosses over again? Thankfully for me, load times are amongst the shortest I've seen, but I know that will not be the case for everyone, which may make the experience even more gruelling. 

Another problem so far has been co-op play. The entirety of the way, I've been playing this with 3 other friends, which has made the experience considerably more difficult. How strange, given that this IS meant to be a co-op game. We frequently find ourselves underleveled for areas simply because playing in co-op splits the experience but doesn't adjust for 4 players. This sort of issue doesn't happen in singleplayer. Ironic.

My third and final gripe is the zer0 Sniper class, who I've been focusing on this entire time. I would briefly like to point out the stupidity of having a melee branch with no genuine melee weapons - asides from that, the Sniper class can feel quite redundant at times. Critical hitboxes are both small and in sometimes ridiculous places, or are totally not existent at all - and even when shot, do not crit properly. Many engagements are in close quarters, and when playing with 4 people, ""getting hurt"" animations can increase the difficulty in landing headshots.
I get this is going to be partially out of my own aim, but all the other factors can sometimes make Sniper Zer0 feel like a chore. 

As for the positives of this game...
+ The gunplay CAN feel amazing
+ There's an incredible addictiveness to getting good loot
+ Landing headshots CAN be satisfying
+ The game looks awesome even on the worst settings

So overall, I recommend it. Is it worth $20? Debatable, but I bought it only sale (only about $7) and I would say I'm satisfied with my purchase so far. I think fundamentally some of the game's design choices turned out to be poor, especially with so much DLC and the issues mentioned above; every game has it's flaws. 

In spite of those things, it is probably worth a try.

Hades,RPG,1145360,Shoulda been GOTY over The Last of Us 2
Hades,RPG,1145360,"After Playing Transistor and Bastion I understood that Supergiant games doesn't really follow the same formula of current game developers. They just make great games every time.

Gameplay is probably the most similar to Bastion of all Supergiant Games, crisp, responsive, fun, fast-paced, challenging (if you wish) and enjoyable.

Greek mythology is always interesting and the way it's implemented on character design, art, visuals, the history and its replayability, is brilliant. 
Character Design in Hades is so sick and probably the strongest point of the game, the re-imagination of Greek Gods in this cartoony/anime art style is so well done and I could fall in love with every character.

Voice acting is always really strong in Supergiant, I remember reading in an AMA that it took them three years to record 1 million lines of dialog, that just shows how much work and love they put in their games. The game is almost fully voice acted and it's incredible.

OST is [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFVjtvuVHpE] fucking amazing [/url] it remind me a lot of DOOM ost but its clearly different and lets you get absorbed by the atmosphere of the game, I would get hooked in a zone for the music alone.

Hades is fucking great and fun and challenging and it has everything you would want in a roguelike."
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Flurry Jab is fast. Other hammers are not fast. Therefore, we want flurry jab. And we do flurry resets until we get it.
I beat this game in less than 8 minutes. 
Please help."
Hades,RPG,1145360,"[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

Hades is a masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it receives. Play it. Even if you think you are not into action roguelikes or Greek mythology, the game is still worth trying out for the sake of an authentic experience. And if you are, well, there is a big chance it might become your favorite.

[h1]Full Review[/h1]

Let me start from afar. Video games as a medium are a way to escape unpleasant or uneventful everyday life. It is escapism, a necessary psychological device to divert thoughts from sadness, loss, or boredom. You can see it in every type of entertainment humans have, not merely video games. Likewise, roguelikes have deep roots in literal “escape” concerning their narrative (the hero always tries to escape a dungeon or labyrinth of sorts or even their fate). We might call it double escapism. At the same time, stories in most roguelikes only distantly resemble real-life situations. That is where Supergiant makes a difference. They not only create an addictive game with exceptional style and music, but they also tell a deeply allegorical coming-of-age story. You know, the type of story every one of us lives through at some point because there are no ideal families, as well as relationships. Maybe some will not see it like that, but this allegory penetrates every aspect of Hades. It returns you from the whimsical world (or should I say Underworld?) to your everyday life with new feelings, thoughts, and a desire to sort everything through. That is the highest praise I could imagine for an entertainment medium.

Hades follows the story of a young godling Zagreus, or Zag for short, and his relationship with his tyrant father, Hades, the god of the Underworld himself. Hades (the god) demands from his son, whom he scornfully calls “boy,” to be responsible, respectful, and obedient. At the same time, he is reluctant to show his love or appreciation. For Zag, there is only one way to deal with it: running away to relatives on Olympus. The problem, though, is that no one can escape the Underworld, even a godling! And so we start our desperate journey as Zag, trying to leave the domain of the dead. The story goes deep; its narration threads through many dialogs with different characters, intertwined between escape attempts into one whole piece. Slowly, the perspective shifts: the initial father-son conflict reveals underlying problems and broader themes. My favorite includes exercising honesty and outspokenness and why it is not always the best course of action in a manifold family to tell everything head-on. I love Greek mythology and Ancient Greek literature, and I must admit the level of detail is brilliant. There are many myths from different sources; Supergiant chooses its interpretations very carefully, so the story feels consistent. It is worth noting that they had a certain degree of freedom regarding the protagonist and his relations with everyone due to his minor significance in Greek mythology. Even there, though, in late interactions with Dionysus, we can learn an Easter egg about [spoiler]how the Orphic Dionysus Zagreus tradition has an internal explanation.[/spoiler] So, yeah, the immersion in the theme is truly brilliant, I mean it!

Gameplay-wise, Hades is as addictive as a perfect roguelike should be. You have to rely on your wit, reaction (sometimes even sense of rhythm), and, of course, luck to fight your way through the ever-changing environment with hundreds of possible adjustments to strategy and tactics. I could play games like Crypt of the NecroDancer or Dicey Dungeons in short sessions, but Hades? Nope. I play it, and play it, and play it. Again and again. It is so very addictive! Different weapons, boons, power-ups, and their combinations result in some weird and powerful twists to efficient tactics, which is an example of RNG done right. If you die, you can start again a bit stronger (if you gather enough Darkness, that is) through the process amusingly called Reflecting. Due to its core mechanics, the game can be frustrating, but that only means your character has not been powerful enough to beat something as of yet. Just play some more, and you will naturally overcome the obstacle. It starts to feel repetitive only when you finish the main story. At that point, the only way of raising the challenge is through the customizable Pact of Punishment, a plot device to make your post-story runs harder.

As always with Supergiant, the voice acting and music are exceptional. Beautiful melodies combined with heavier riffs and reverberations suit the game’s style and story greatly. And when Orpheus (Darren Korb, the composer) and Eurydice (Ashley Barrett) start singing, their verses seem to be out of this world. It is not a simple task to assume the roles of the legendary musician and his partner/muse and sing their parts convincingly. Somehow, Darren and Ashley pull it out! I literally had tears and goosebumps listening to In the Blood when the credits rolled. That was magnificent!

Lastly, I want to briefly mention the Fated List of Minor Prophecies which adds depth to the choice-making during escape attempts, and the detailed statistics menu for your runs. Little nuances like these contribute to the entire thing, making it much more enjoyable. And, well, there is also fishing. Because why not?"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hades has an [b] amazing story, [/b] with [b] fantastic storytelling. [/b] It also has an [b] excellent soundtrack and artstyle, [/b] [b] superb combat, [/b] and [b] great voice acting. [/b] 

In this game every death feels like a reward as you grow stronger. The progression, and character development is well thought out. The runs are unique because the chambers are always different, and you never know what you'll find. You can even alter the fate, and make your own boon combinations from the ground up, with the weapon you chose.
The combat is fluid and addicting. However, if you're here for the story, there is God Mode which gives damage reduction. 

Every other roguelike felt too grindy and boring for me, but this one is just different.
Hades is a [b] must play masterpiece. [/b] Really worth the price."
Hades,RPG,1145360,I love this game so much and I can't stop talking/thinking about it. It's just amazing. I have only 35 hours on steam because my controller stopped working so I ended up buying it on the switch (I basically have about 75 hours at the time of this review) so I can play it because I couldn't not play it lmao. The art the music the story the voice acting the gameplay literally every aspect that you would expect from a good game and maybe even more. I'm just in shock by the amount of things you can do in this game and I think I'll continue to play it for a long time to come. Thank you for this Supergiant and thank you Jen for the amazing art you're an inspiration!
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hm
Hades
Yes
Buy"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"great game, must play for voice actors tbh"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hades is a rougelike game that actually incorporates the concept of ""doing runs over and over"" in a way that makes sense into it's story. You're not just doing this because its a videogame, rather because in the context of the game its an actual mechanic and a ""normal behavior"".
In this game you will likely die in early chambers when you begin, but this is pretty much on par to how the game is designed, as you play more you will not only get better at handling Zagreus and learn enemy patterns, but also collect resources to make future runs easier, as you'll be able to permanently upgrade yourself, making future attempts more likely to succeed.
The main powers you acquire are derived from Olympian gods, each offering their own set of effects that you can equip to your main moves, or just gain passive buffs that might alter how you approach a given run, there's also 6 different weapons that can later even gain new alterations, even though the game encourages you to try all weapons by buffing the rewards you earn if you use a specific one during your next run, you might just find your favorite one and use it to achieve more victories.
The game also has a wide cast of charming characters that you'll be able to interact with during and before/after a run, deepening your relationship with each as you progress and eventually even unlocking sub stories related to them, allowing them to grow more as characters and friends of yours.
Overall this game is a great experience, and from popular word, even if you're unfamiliar with the rougelike genre, this game has proven to find their way to be liked by these people. There is a lot of extra unlockables you can pursue if you decide to, and the game even allows you to pump up the difficulty with set modifiers, to test the skill of those seeking for a greater challenge.
The true GOTY of 2020."
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Bought because it keeps appearing in front of my face! Got to say that is my best decision ever! Never going to regret buying the game, I dont usually play these kind of games, but Hades keeps me interested."

Hades,RPG,1145360,its ok
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hades is a rogue-lite action game, where you gain control over Zagreus, son of Hades, in his multiple attempts of escaping the god of the dead’s domain.

Every run in the game is randomly generated – rooms, rewards, shop items etc. The main system of building a character lies in getting so called boons from various Olympian gods. Zag has a number of slots – like weapon’s main attack, cast and others, as well as unlimited pool for various passives, like enhanced moving speed or an ability to dash more times in a row. The boons from every specific god offer a variety of different bonuses (apart from enhancing overall damage of an action connected to specific slot) and specialize in some unique quirk. For example, most of Poseidon’s boons apply knock-away effects as well as bonus damage to bosses. There are also some permanent upgrades, for both the character (for example the number of revives for the run or the starting gold coins for shop items) and the main hub (most of them are cosmetic though), that can be bought with two special currencies respectively, that are accumulated over the runs.

The game offers 6 weapons to choose from for the particular run, and four so called aspects for every one of them, that adds a unique set of advantages and drawbacks, like decreasing max health but allowing to heal yourself by using one of the weapon’s special attacks. You can also choose one of the special items, acquired by interacting with characters in the game (gifting them the special item – ambrosia), that have different effects like bonus speed for clearing rooms fast or chance of getting health items for breaking down vases scattered on the levels. The only problem is the balance of the weapons, some are drastically worse than the others (yes, spear, I am looking at you).

While the main story is rather primitive, the side stories and the dialogues with characters, especially the gods, are simply wonderful. There are tons of dialogue lines, every one of which is fully voiced, and voiced perfectly, ideally showing the personality of every character.

The music is, as always, just beautiful, Darren Korb did an excellent job at designing all of it, utilizing even more assets at his hands this time, everything is just perfect.

The visuals offer nothing spectacular, but they are cartoonishly nice and cute.

Overall, it is another solid title from Supergiant Games. The gameplay is fun and satisfying. The story is okay, the characters and their voice acting are wonderful. The game might be a little too simple for a rogue-likish experience, but still is very enjoyable and memorable experience. Would definitely recommend it."

Hades,RPG,1145360,Shoulda been GOTY over The Last of Us 2
Hades,RPG,1145360,"After Playing Transistor and Bastion I understood that Supergiant games doesn't really follow the same formula of current game developers. They just make great games every time.

Gameplay is probably the most similar to Bastion of all Supergiant Games, crisp, responsive, fun, fast-paced, challenging (if you wish) and enjoyable.

Greek mythology is always interesting and the way it's implemented on character design, art, visuals, the history and its replayability, is brilliant. 
Character Design in Hades is so sick and probably the strongest point of the game, the re-imagination of Greek Gods in this cartoony/anime art style is so well done and I could fall in love with every character.

Voice acting is always really strong in Supergiant, I remember reading in an AMA that it took them three years to record 1 million lines of dialog, that just shows how much work and love they put in their games. The game is almost fully voice acted and it's incredible.

OST is [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFVjtvuVHpE] fucking amazing [/url] it remind me a lot of DOOM ost but its clearly different and lets you get absorbed by the atmosphere of the game, I would get hooked in a zone for the music alone.

Hades is fucking great and fun and challenging and it has everything you would want in a roguelike."

Hades,RPG,1145360,"[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

Hades is a masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it receives. Play it. Even if you think you are not into action roguelikes or Greek mythology, the game is still worth trying out for the sake of an authentic experience. And if you are, well, there is a big chance it might become your favorite.

[h1]Full Review[/h1]

Let me start from afar. Video games as a medium are a way to escape unpleasant or uneventful everyday life. It is escapism, a necessary psychological device to divert thoughts from sadness, loss, or boredom. You can see it in every type of entertainment humans have, not merely video games. Likewise, roguelikes have deep roots in literal “escape” concerning their narrative (the hero always tries to escape a dungeon or labyrinth of sorts or even their fate). We might call it double escapism. At the same time, stories in most roguelikes only distantly resemble real-life situations. That is where Supergiant makes a difference. They not only create an addictive game with exceptional style and music, but they also tell a deeply allegorical coming-of-age story. You know, the type of story every one of us lives through at some point because there are no ideal families, as well as relationships. Maybe some will not see it like that, but this allegory penetrates every aspect of Hades. It returns you from the whimsical world (or should I say Underworld?) to your everyday life with new feelings, thoughts, and a desire to sort everything through. That is the highest praise I could imagine for an entertainment medium.

Hades follows the story of a young godling Zagreus, or Zag for short, and his relationship with his tyrant father, Hades, the god of the Underworld himself. Hades (the god) demands from his son, whom he scornfully calls “boy,” to be responsible, respectful, and obedient. At the same time, he is reluctant to show his love or appreciation. For Zag, there is only one way to deal with it: running away to relatives on Olympus. The problem, though, is that no one can escape the Underworld, even a godling! And so we start our desperate journey as Zag, trying to leave the domain of the dead. The story goes deep; its narration threads through many dialogs with different characters, intertwined between escape attempts into one whole piece. Slowly, the perspective shifts: the initial father-son conflict reveals underlying problems and broader themes. My favorite includes exercising honesty and outspokenness and why it is not always the best course of action in a manifold family to tell everything head-on. I love Greek mythology and Ancient Greek literature, and I must admit the level of detail is brilliant. There are many myths from different sources; Supergiant chooses its interpretations very carefully, so the story feels consistent. It is worth noting that they had a certain degree of freedom regarding the protagonist and his relations with everyone due to his minor significance in Greek mythology. Even there, though, in late interactions with Dionysus, we can learn an Easter egg about [spoiler]how the Orphic Dionysus Zagreus tradition has an internal explanation.[/spoiler] So, yeah, the immersion in the theme is truly brilliant, I mean it!

Gameplay-wise, Hades is as addictive as a perfect roguelike should be. You have to rely on your wit, reaction (sometimes even sense of rhythm), and, of course, luck to fight your way through the ever-changing environment with hundreds of possible adjustments to strategy and tactics. I could play games like Crypt of the NecroDancer or Dicey Dungeons in short sessions, but Hades? Nope. I play it, and play it, and play it. Again and again. It is so very addictive! Different weapons, boons, power-ups, and their combinations result in some weird and powerful twists to efficient tactics, which is an example of RNG done right. If you die, you can start again a bit stronger (if you gather enough Darkness, that is) through the process amusingly called Reflecting. Due to its core mechanics, the game can be frustrating, but that only means your character has not been powerful enough to beat something as of yet. Just play some more, and you will naturally overcome the obstacle. It starts to feel repetitive only when you finish the main story. At that point, the only way of raising the challenge is through the customizable Pact of Punishment, a plot device to make your post-story runs harder.

As always with Supergiant, the voice acting and music are exceptional. Beautiful melodies combined with heavier riffs and reverberations suit the game’s style and story greatly. And when Orpheus (Darren Korb, the composer) and Eurydice (Ashley Barrett) start singing, their verses seem to be out of this world. It is not a simple task to assume the roles of the legendary musician and his partner/muse and sing their parts convincingly. Somehow, Darren and Ashley pull it out! I literally had tears and goosebumps listening to In the Blood when the credits rolled. That was magnificent!

Lastly, I want to briefly mention the Fated List of Minor Prophecies which adds depth to the choice-making during escape attempts, and the detailed statistics menu for your runs. Little nuances like these contribute to the entire thing, making it much more enjoyable. And, well, there is also fishing. Because why not?"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hades has an [b] amazing story, [/b] with [b] fantastic storytelling. [/b] It also has an [b] excellent soundtrack and artstyle, [/b] [b] superb combat, [/b] and [b] great voice acting. [/b] 

In this game every death feels like a reward as you grow stronger. The progression, and character development is well thought out. The runs are unique because the chambers are always different, and you never know what you'll find. You can even alter the fate, and make your own boon combinations from the ground up, with the weapon you chose.
The combat is fluid and addicting. However, if you're here for the story, there is God Mode which gives damage reduction. 

Every other roguelike felt too grindy and boring for me, but this one is just different.
Hades is a [b] must play masterpiece. [/b] Really worth the price."
Hades,RPG,1145360,I love this game so much and I can't stop talking/thinking about it. It's just amazing. I have only 35 hours on steam because my controller stopped working so I ended up buying it on the switch (I basically have about 75 hours at the time of this review) so I can play it because I couldn't not play it lmao. The art the music the story the voice acting the gameplay literally every aspect that you would expect from a good game and maybe even more. I'm just in shock by the amount of things you can do in this game and I think I'll continue to play it for a long time to come. Thank you for this Supergiant and thank you Jen for the amazing art you're an inspiration!
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hm
Hades
Yes
Buy"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"great game, must play for voice actors tbh"
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hades is a rougelike game that actually incorporates the concept of ""doing runs over and over"" in a way that makes sense into it's story. You're not just doing this because its a videogame, rather because in the context of the game its an actual mechanic and a ""normal behavior"".
In this game you will likely die in early chambers when you begin, but this is pretty much on par to how the game is designed, as you play more you will not only get better at handling Zagreus and learn enemy patterns, but also collect resources to make future runs easier, as you'll be able to permanently upgrade yourself, making future attempts more likely to succeed.
The main powers you acquire are derived from Olympian gods, each offering their own set of effects that you can equip to your main moves, or just gain passive buffs that might alter how you approach a given run, there's also 6 different weapons that can later even gain new alterations, even though the game encourages you to try all weapons by buffing the rewards you earn if you use a specific one during your next run, you might just find your favorite one and use it to achieve more victories.
The game also has a wide cast of charming characters that you'll be able to interact with during and before/after a run, deepening your relationship with each as you progress and eventually even unlocking sub stories related to them, allowing them to grow more as characters and friends of yours.
Overall this game is a great experience, and from popular word, even if you're unfamiliar with the rougelike genre, this game has proven to find their way to be liked by these people. There is a lot of extra unlockables you can pursue if you decide to, and the game even allows you to pump up the difficulty with set modifiers, to test the skill of those seeking for a greater challenge.
The true GOTY of 2020."
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Bought because it keeps appearing in front of my face! Got to say that is my best decision ever! Never going to regret buying the game, I dont usually play these kind of games, but Hades keeps me interested."
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hades is an amazing game, give it a try.
The mechanics are fun, the music is really cool and the graphics are amazing. 
+ They actually voiced everyone in this game and its perfect. 
Everyone has a voice that matches the character perfectly."
Hades,RPG,1145360,"really addicting i love it

Hades,RPG,1145360,Great game for people who like to experiment with different kinds of play style.
Hades,RPG,1145360,"A stroke of pure genius. The graphics are beautiful, the voice acting is amazing, and the music is overwhelming. The rogue-like concept is incorporated in such an amazing fashion that makes me love it, although I usually dislike rogue-likes.

Good story-telling, game design, and an incredible replayability. I have rarely played another game 50+ hours after getting all achievements.

Hats off, Supergiant!"

Hades,RPG,1145360,"I almost committed one of the biggest crimes in gaming history: forgot to give this masterpiece a proper positive review after I've done playing it for over a hundred hours. So yeah, that's how good this game is."
Hades,RPG,1145360,its ok
Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hades is a rogue-lite action game, where you gain control over Zagreus, son of Hades, in his multiple attempts of escaping the god of the dead’s domain.

Every run in the game is randomly generated – rooms, rewards, shop items etc. The main system of building a character lies in getting so called boons from various Olympian gods. Zag has a number of slots – like weapon’s main attack, cast and others, as well as unlimited pool for various passives, like enhanced moving speed or an ability to dash more times in a row. The boons from every specific god offer a variety of different bonuses (apart from enhancing overall damage of an action connected to specific slot) and specialize in some unique quirk.

Dying Light,Action,239140,"Dying light is what dead island should have been. A very solid game.

Graphically Dying Light is stunning, not only are the environments and character models great but it all looks so very smooth as you're hurtling through the streets. But that's nothing until you start to climb, at a height being able to see across the city during various weathers and daytime the beauty is near flawless.

My rating- 8/10

Graphically Dying Light is stunning, not only are the environments and character models great but it all looks so very smooth as you're hurtling through the streets. But that's nothing until you start to climb, at a height being able to see across the city during various weathers and daytime the beauty is near flawless.

My rating- 8/10

I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something new. Co-op is pretty good :)

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Destiny 2 is my favorite game and has been since its release. Here are some reasons why:

Pros
-Fun shooting and movement mechanics
-Awesome musical scores
-Beautiful world art and visuals
-A story that started out kinda vague but over the past few years has become much more engaging and intriguing
-A wide variety of weapons, abilities, and armor to choose from and experiment with
-campaigns (I find them fun, especially if it's your first time running through them)
-I really enjoy nightfalls, dungeons, and raids, each of which have varying levels of difficulty
-though may people have mixed thoughts on pvp, I still find it fun and like experimenting with different classes (though it is sorely needing some more updates)
-A community that while labeled as toxic by some, I have still made a lot of friends within
-Bungie keeps updating the game periodically, enough to keep me interested

Cons
-cheaters (though this is a rampant issue, I haven't run into them enough myself to make the experience too negative. Can't say the same for other people though)
-some weapon and ability metas (like stasis) can be a bit oppressive, and the nerfs that reign them in can take time
-content vaulting (though I understand why they do it) just sucks to see some stuff leave"
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"I think the world that bungie has built here is amazing. The lore and a lot of the story building in this game is incredible. On top of that, the gunplay is smooth, the classes are all good in their own ways, and the pve side of this game can be amazing. However, destiny is not a pvp game. Do not go into this game thinking it is going to be a good pvp game. Pvp is full of cheaters and people who haven't seen the sun in years because they were too busy using felwinter's lie on guardians in the crucible. The pve side of things, is much better though. Destiny most definitely has had its ups and downs, and I have taken many breaks from this game throughout the years. Honestly though, this game has a special place in my steam library. Unlike other games, I still remember the first exotic I ever got, I still remember the first time I ever cleared a raid, and I still remember playing gambit for countless hours to get a bow that I only used twice, but who could forget that right? In all seriousness, play this game. Read the lore, learn the characters, master the gunplay, but most of all, don't take the game to seriously or you will end up hating it with a passion."
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,I love this game. Don't play it.
Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Like shooting and looting?  Like the chase of trying to get the perfect rolled piece of gear to complete your flawlessly crafted build.

Get in here so you can also be salty about crucible."

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"I have played this game a fucking lot and what i have realized over time is even if stuff looks as advertised during trailer when it launches ..developers notoriously try to balance things way more focused towards pvp community more often than not which affects stuff you enjoy in pve over time. the reason i bought latest DLC is because I thought  its really good  in pve all the crowd control and buffs etc but since CC is not okay  in pvp they nerfed that aspect of entire stasis which killed the mood to play stasis. I bought a year long pass because i want to see stuff as advertised in trailer to work as advertised in trailer but not your balance ruining the fun factor. 
Game looks great 
Game plays great except when their servers decide to mess with you randomly 
Game is rewarding in its own way 

But its bad investment of the time if i am grinding something because its awesome and when i get it ..since pvp community complains ..devs nerf it to ground in pve and vice versa .. I would really prefer if devs decide to balance PVE and PVP separately as everyone will be happy with their time invested . I will discontinue buying next expansions as i lost trust in the developers.

Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Unlike Destiny 1, this installment offers little innovation. There´s a basic model here that was implemented on all expansions, on every stage of Destiny 2 to date:

1) Make a great introductory mission, get players hooked.
2) Make a few updates
3) Copy and paste activities and missions.

From the start this game had no soul, no love at all.

Really different experience from Destiny 1. Played the demo, it sucked but the introductory mission was great. Thought to myself ""Well, D1 was great, let´s give it a chance"".

Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"First time ever I get to play a Tomb Raider game and I'm glad I started with this one. An excellent reboot of Tomb Raider, such a great game with great graphics and design of characters, Story-wise is nice too feels like a proper TR story, gameplay-wise is very fun for me experiencing a TR game ( Mini puzzles, secret tombs, and crafting weapons) plus the voice acting of Lara is perfect I've seen amongst other Laras'. I'm so looking forward to playing Rise/Shadow of Tomb Raider next time I get the chance, looking at gameplays of them they look ""Worth it"" defiantly."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"A good interactive ""game-movie"" with an excelent main character.

Most of the time, Tomb Raider feels like a press and hold W interactive movie followed by a couple of quick time events. There is nothing wrong about it if the ""movie"" is good, and Tomb Raider is a good one.

There is no real difficulty to it, so I recommend it to everyone who has started in the gaming world as a first game, you can learn the basics of movement, quick time events, upgrades, exploration and combat. It has a good enough story about becoming stronger, facing sacrifice and make it worth it. And Lara Croft (reboot) is a truly memorable character that has gained a place in modern gaming history.

Explosions, non-stop action, Japanese temples, samurai-demons (Oni), tombs awaiting to be raided and a young Lara Croft that slowly transforms into the real definition of a strong survivor and a knowledge-thirsty adventurer.

A 2013 Triple-A game that aged very well. Graphics look good and mechanics are still fresh and solid.

Don't wait for them to give it for free again, it may never happen, go ahead and buy it, it should be worth more than what it's going for anyway."

the puzzles are cool and not too dumb, the platforming is pleasurable.
the main story... I simply don't care. The quick time events and the cutscenes are quite annoying, however you can skip the latter ones.
I wish there were more different settings, not the same island. The ability to revisit all levels after completing the storyline is nice though.

Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"1. There are no tombs in Tomb Raider.

2. Lara Croft is a mass murdering psychopath whining about shooting a man, before killing all his mates immediately after.  Lara killed people in previous Tomb Raider games as well, but the way this game presents it, it falls narratively flat and is impossible to empathize with.  Maybe they should have saved this part of her development for the second or third title, or had her be a Batman style hero who doesn't kill.  But nope, Action sells.

3. We know Tomb Raider was build on large, desolate environments, ancient tombs and mythological settings and the wonder of exploring them.  There were some missteps in the franchise but it usually returned to form.  This game: here's World War II island, Bear Grylls kills 10 men with a single arrow and then bombs a dozen more.

4. The game is a Lara Croft torture and death simulator, I guess that makes some people happy.

It's alright for what it is, which is a third-person action game, but for someone looking for a great Tomb Raider game, Lara Croft is for all intents dead.  If this is what we get from now on, and the best Tomb Raider game we get is a top-down twin-stick shooter that nails the feel and spirit of the franchise better than a triple A blockbuster like this, then I am very sad indeed.

I'd have no problem playing a female-led Splinter Cell game, but I don't want a sneaking, murdering Sam Fisher in my Tomb Raider game.

Lara Croft was always a female Indiana Jones.  This Lara is a female Nathan Drake, which is ironic because Uncharted was imitating Tomb Raider.

Also why did they release a graphical upgrade for the 'next-gen' console systems but they left us with this Lara who looks nothing like her cutscene representations?"
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Do you have a band-aid, Lara? Cuz I scrapped my knee falling for you. <3"

Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Motion Sickness Warning: Lara Croft jogs make the camera shake as if Lara was a giant.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The premise is really good, stranded on an island ruled by a supernatural entity that causes weird storms and is worshiped by your enemies.
When you start out is really feels like your making your way into a inhospitable place at the edge of your capabilities. You feel as if the entity is watching you by striking at you with lightning as the rain is pouring down to make you lose your grip and fall to your death.

By the time morning rolls around its all gone.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game just becomes 3rd person action game were you go about cleaning the island of it's enemies. No more supernatural enemies or mystery just Call Of Duty soldiers with rifles, shotguns and shields.
I do not understand like what happened in the development, there so many ideas:
- when you get to the beach it becomes clear that the island has been stranding peoples from all eras, pirates, merchants, WW2 soldiers etc. Why don't you fight against multiple different groups each seeking a different goal.
- the game is set in multiple environments but the they all kinda feel the same, like you don't feel the altitude at all.
The game is supposed to be set in the mountains but there is no point were you have to follow a narrow path going up and risking to fall, for the majority of the game if you look down you will see the generic walkable ground and not some vista of the mountains. In fact most of the levels seem to be cornered of somehow, I do not remember ever falling out of the level at it's edge.
- the platforming, the core traversal mechanic (actually jogging is core traversal mechanic in practice) is boring.
It's the same Prince Of Persia/Uncharted style of ledge grabing were you can go and make yourself a coffe while Lara is holding on to the edge.
There is no skill involved in traversal, no puzzle of what ledges you need to grab in order to reach your destination because most traversal sections are one way only and no timing skill you don't have to time you jumps at all you just need to reach the end of the ledge.
I think you can do most of the platforming with just one finger because Lara doesn't seem to jump farther if jump while running. I don't remember ever having to jump further that before (I write this review some time later though after playing the game).

[h1]Portraial[/h1]
I usually don't care as much and I am not a fan of the old games but after taking a break from the game and playing Batman Arkham City I couldn't help noticing some stuff:
- why is Lara for the entire game portrait as weak, like you can be on the beach level near the end fully equipped, leveled up, 3 digit kill count and having overcome some stuff but her expression is ""afraid please help me"".
You would think after killing people by driving her pickaxe into their skulls and after rising from blood she should be more like Rambo: First Blood, a predator.
Why do Crysis 2, Batman: Arkham Knight and Far Cry get to have confident characters from the start and throughout the game.
- why does Lara need to suffer and look injured ALL THE TIME to prove she is strong (wash your face and change clothes there a plenty of downed enemies).
I have not played a game were your character get ping ponged so much into everything.
Did you really need to have fatalities for all deaths including from the enemies ? it's not a horror game.
- you could be at 95% of the game and Lara still says to herself ""You can do it Lara"".
Do you think Batman says to himself encouragements or do you think his enemies need encouragements to face Batman.

In the end it's meh."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,Very Beautiful Game
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Tomb Raider 2013, fairly old now in 2021 at 8 years old, but I'm glad to say it's still amazing.

The graphics are beautiful, and don't make the game feel old at all; and the soundtrack is pretty decent for the type of game that Tomb Raider is.

The story is decent, there's nothing too special about it - just another survivor story, really, but what makes this different is the way the story is presented. The map is open, and you can mostly go wherever you want except for a few story parts. The gameplay is fairly well flowing as well, there are very few and very short load times between parts of a map, and they're mostly hidden behind cutscenes.

Combat is OK, it can get quite repetitive with enemies repeating the same attacks over and over, and it can get quite monotonous. Mechanics in the game are great, and the game doesn't give you a huge tutorial at the start - one mechanic is only given at the very end-game, which is nice.

Overall, other than a few minor complaints (as listed above), the game is great. I didn't find any bugs at all. 

Definitely recommend this to anyone thinking of buying it! I'd give this game a solid 8/10."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,Appreciate this game developer very much for making a very beautifully made action game for Lara Croft. Will definitely buy the rest. Awesome!
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Honestly, I was floored by how good this game was. I thought it looked interesting and enjoyed the original 90s games when I was a kid so I decided to give it a try. It's so well done. The story is really interesting and significantly above average for games these days, the game itself is stunning, the controls feel incredibly natural and the voice acting is brilliant. Little things like how enemies do not respawn once you've killed them makes going back to previous zones to explore every nook and cranny a joy. You can upgrade your weapons but the crafting system isn't overly complex. Lara herself is just incredibly acted, modelled, animated and written. You really watch her grow from a frightened girl to a wrathful killing machine and you feel the anger build along with her as you play through."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"back in these days the devs actually knew what they were doing. an important thing to realise about this one is that it is not an offical part of the Tomb Raider IP, it is doing its own special thing on the side but is still under the same umbrella as the originals."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"This is the first Tomb Raider game I've played, besides something on a gameboy color I never finished. My playtime is competing the story and a few tombs (tombs are side mission puzzles). I probably won't be replaying it anytime soon, but I enjoyed most of the playthrough very much.

This is a movie game. Quick time events, running on platforms that are crumbling with every step, and LOTS AND LOTS OF CLIMBING. Alternate title could be Rock Climber Simulator 2013 (laugh). 

The combat was good, with four different guns with upgrades. I really wouldn't call this a third person shooter, but yeah there's a lot. The next thing is the climbing. I'm going to be honest, I love platformers, and I loive the sections where you're climbing up a deteriorating bridge and stuff, but sometimes climbing rocks feels tedious.

I liked the story, it was simple, the cutscenes didn't go on too long and the cinematic gameplay is some of the best I've seen. Overall, this game was great, I got it for only $2.24, I will definitely think about buying the sequels."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"First time ever I get to play a Tomb Raider game and I'm glad I started with this one.

Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"A good interactive ""game-movie"" with an excelent main character.

Most of the time, Tomb Raider feels like a press and hold W interactive movie followed by a couple of quick time events. There is nothing wrong about it if the ""movie"" is good, and Tomb Raider is a good one.

There is no real difficulty to it, so I recommend it to everyone who has started in the gaming world as a first game, you can learn the basics of movement, quick time events, upgrades, exploration and combat. It has a good enough story about becoming stronger, facing sacrifice and make it worth it. And Lara Croft (reboot) is a truly memorable character that has gained a place in modern gaming history.

Explosions, non-stop action, Japanese temples, samurai-demons (Oni), tombs awaiting to be raided and a young Lara Croft that slowly transforms into the real definition of a strong survivor and a knowledge-thirsty adventurer.

A 2013 Triple-A game that aged very well. Graphics look good and mechanics are still fresh and solid.

Don't wait for them to give it for free again, it may never happen, go ahead and buy it, it should be worth more than what it's going for anyway."

Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,GOATED
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"funny engaging and simple combat and  great stealth elements if u wanna play it that way. 
the puzzles are cool and not too dumb, the platforming is pleasurable.
the main story... I simply don't care. The quick time events and the cutscenes are quite annoying, however you can skip the latter ones.
I wish there were more different settings, not the same island. The ability to revisit all levels after completing the storyline is nice though.

Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"1. There are no tombs in Tomb Raider.

2. Lara Croft is a mass murdering psychopath whining about shooting a man, before killing all his mates immediately after.  Lara killed people in previous Tomb Raider games as well, but the way this game presents it, it falls narratively flat and is impossible to empathize with.  Maybe they should have saved this part of her development for the second or third title, or had her be a Batman style hero who doesn't kill.  But nope, Action sells.

3. We know Tomb Raider was build on large, desolate environments, ancient tombs and mythological settings and the wonder of exploring them.  There were some missteps in the franchise but it usually returned to form.  This game: here's World War II island, Bear Grylls kills 10 men with a single arrow and then bombs a dozen more.

4. The game is a Lara Croft torture and death simulator, I guess that makes some people happy.

It's alright for what it is, which is a third-person action game, but for someone looking for a great Tomb Raider game, Lara Croft is for all intents dead.  If this is what we get from now on, and the best Tomb Raider game we get is a top-down twin-stick shooter that nails the feel and spirit of the franchise better than a triple A blockbuster like this, then I am very sad indeed.

I'd have no problem playing a female-led Splinter Cell game, but I don't want a sneaking, murdering Sam Fisher in my Tomb Raider game.

Lara Croft was always a female Indiana Jones.  This Lara is a female Nathan Drake, which is ironic because Uncharted was imitating Tomb Raider.

Also why did they release a graphical upgrade for the 'next-gen' console systems but they left us with this Lara who looks nothing like her cutscene representations?"

Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Motion Sickness Warning: Lara Croft jogs make the camera shake as if Lara was a giant.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The premise is really good, stranded on an island ruled by a supernatural entity that causes weird storms and is worshiped by your enemies.
When you start out is really feels like your making your way into a inhospitable place at the edge of your capabilities. You feel as if the entity is watching you by striking at you with lightning as the rain is pouring down to make you lose your grip and fall to your death.

By the time morning rolls around its all gone.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game just becomes 3rd person action game were you go about cleaning the island of it's enemies. No more supernatural enemies or mystery just Call Of Duty soldiers with rifles, shotguns and shields.
I do not understand like what happened in the development, there so many ideas:
- when you get to the beach it becomes clear that the island has been stranding peoples from all eras, pirates, merchants, WW2 soldiers etc. Why don't you fight against multiple different groups each seeking a different goal.
- the game is set in multiple environments but the they all kinda feel the same, like you don't feel the altitude at all.
The game is supposed to be set in the mountains but there is no point were you have to follow a narrow path going up and risking to fall, for the majority of the game if you look down you will see the generic walkable ground and not some vista of the mountains. In fact most of the levels seem to be cornered of somehow, I do not remember ever falling out of the level at it's edge.
- the platforming, the core traversal mechanic (actually jogging is core traversal mechanic in practice) is boring.
It's the same Prince Of Persia/Uncharted style of ledge grabing were you can go and make yourself a coffe while Lara is holding on to the edge.
There is no skill involved in traversal, no puzzle of what ledges you need to grab in order to reach your destination because most traversal sections are one way only and no timing skill you don't have to time you jumps at all you just need to reach the end of the ledge.
I think you can do most of the platforming with just one finger because Lara doesn't seem to jump farther if jump while running. I don't remember ever having to jump further that before (I write this review some time later though after playing the game).

[h1]Portraial[/h1]
I usually don't care as much and I am not a fan of the old games but after taking a break from the game and playing Batman Arkham City I couldn't help noticing some stuff:
- why is Lara for the entire game portrait as weak, like you can be on the beach level near the end fully equipped, leveled up, 3 digit kill count and having overcome some stuff but her expression is ""afraid please help me"".
You would think after killing people by driving her pickaxe into their skulls and after rising from blood she should be more like Rambo: First Blood, a predator.
Why do Crysis 2, Batman: Arkham Knight and Far Cry get to have confident characters from the start and throughout the game.
- why does Lara need to suffer and look injured ALL THE TIME to prove she is strong (wash your face and change clothes there a plenty of downed enemies).
I have not played a game were your character get ping ponged so much into everything.
Did you really need to have fatalities for all deaths including from the enemies ? it's not a horror game.
- you could be at 95% of the game and Lara still says to herself ""You can do it Lara"".
Do you think Batman says to himself encouragements or do you think his enemies need encouragements to face Batman.

In the end it's meh."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,Very Beautiful Game
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Tomb Raider 2013, fairly old now in 2021 at 8 years old, but I'm glad to say it's still amazing.

The graphics are beautiful, and don't make the game feel old at all; and the soundtrack is pretty decent for the type of game that Tomb Raider is.

The story is decent, there's nothing too special about it - just another survivor story, really, but what makes this different is the way the story is presented. The map is open, and you can mostly go wherever you want except for a few story parts. The gameplay is fairly well flowing as well, there are very few and very short load times between parts of a map, and they're mostly hidden behind cutscenes.

Combat is OK, it can get quite repetitive with enemies repeating the same attacks over and over, and it can get quite monotonous. Mechanics in the game are great, and the game doesn't give you a huge tutorial at the start - one mechanic is only given at the very end-game, which is nice.

Overall, other than a few minor complaints (as listed above), the game is great. I didn't find any bugs at all. 

Definitely recommend this to anyone thinking of buying it! I'd give this game a solid 8/10."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,Appreciate this game developer very much for making a very beautifully made action game for Lara Croft. Will definitely buy the rest. Awesome!
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Honestly, I was floored by how good this game was. I thought it looked interesting and enjoyed the original 90s games when I was a kid so I decided to give it a try. It's so well done. The story is really interesting and significantly above average for games these days, the game itself is stunning, the controls feel incredibly natural and the voice acting is brilliant. Little things like how enemies do not respawn once you've killed them makes going back to previous zones to explore every nook and cranny a joy. You can upgrade your weapons but the crafting system isn't overly complex. Lara herself is just incredibly acted, modelled, animated and written. You really watch her grow from a frightened girl to a wrathful killing machine and you feel the anger build along with her as you play through."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"back in these days the devs actually knew what they were doing. an important thing to realise about this one is that it is not an offical part of the Tomb Raider IP, it is doing its own special thing on the side but is still under the same umbrella as the originals."
Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"This is the first Tomb Raider game I've played, besides something on a gameboy color I never finished. My playtime is competing the story and a few tombs (tombs are side mission puzzles). I probably won't be replaying it anytime soon, but I enjoyed most of the playthrough very much.

This is a movie game. Quick time events, running on platforms that are crumbling with every step, and LOTS AND LOTS OF CLIMBING. Alternate title could be Rock Climber Simulator 2013 (laugh). 

The combat was good, with four different guns with upgrades. I really wouldn't call this a third person shooter, but yeah there's a lot. The next thing is the climbing. I'm going to be honest, I love platformers, and I loive the sections where you're climbing up a deteriorating bridge and stuff, but sometimes climbing rocks feels tedious.

I liked the story, it was simple, the cutscenes didn't go on too long and the cinematic gameplay is some of the best I've seen. Overall, this game was great, I got it for only $2.24, I will definitely think about buying the sequels."

Just because you have a lot of items, doesn't mean you are invincible. I think that is want makes the game great. Also, you need to invested your time into the game to get new characters and abilities. This game is not P2W and runs can last for hours. This game has two different play styles, you can take your time on each level and get all the items but the enemies will be really strong.

Counter-Strike: Source,Action,240,"Been playing since HL demo received with my 1st gfx card in the 90's (yes I'm an old git).
Have to say that Condition Zero still remains my favourite CS incarnation but as CZ (and the original CS) do not work any longer on Steam, the Source engine nicely fills the gap.
I have to confess that when it was originally launched I was not a fan at all of the source engine as it's bullet reg and general feel of the game was radically different the the CZ engine that I so loved.
That said after not playing the source engine for an awful lot of years, it has come along way in that time and has made big improvements since I last played and feels a lot closer to the CZ engine that I so loved.

Half-Life 2,Action,220,"You know how an Italian chef kisses his fingers and says something in Italian that translates to ""A masterpiece"" after tasting their own dish? That's how I feel about this game."
Half-Life 2,Action,220,A based man at a cringe place can make all the difference in the world
Half-Life 2,Action,220,One of the best 1st person shooters i have ever played. On my second run of the game. The difficulty is balanced and normal actually feels appropriately named. Not too easy and not too hard.
Half-Life 2,Action,220,"Played this game, thought it was a 7/10 at best. Then I remembered this game several months later and started loving it. The more time passes, the more I love this game. What is going on? I don't know. 10/10 game."
Half-Life 2,Action,220,dark monk
Half-Life 2,Action,220,"Wow, what a game. What I got out of this game was enjoyment / boredom at some points. I loved the bright open parts but the dark parts were not doing it for me. As my first half life completion. I say this game is worth your money. It is a good game to play or even replay if you are struck with boredom. I held off the half life series for 10 years and I am so glad I checked it out. This game does and always will deserve a 10/10/

Thank you for creating this masterpiece, Valve"
Half-Life 2,Action,220,pretty cool garry's mod custom campaign
Half-Life 2,Action,220,The game that could have been very DARK AND GRITTY
Half-Life 2,Action,220,Literally one of the best computer games of all time
Half-Life 2,Action,220,"Man..... This never gets old, i don't have much to say 10/10 game."
Half-Life 2,Action,220,nice
Half-Life 2,Action,220,Peak Fiction
Half-Life 2,Action,220,Pick Up That Can.
Half-Life 2,Action,220,"Oh fiddle sticks what now?
"
Half-Life 2,Action,220,"Amazing how a game that is over a decade old can feel so fresh. Everything from the gameplay, characters, story, writing is amazing, even the graphics hold up pretty well today. Definitely recommend, worth every penny and then some."
Half-Life 2,Action,220,"classic game, still very good and holds up."
Half-Life 2,Action,220,I bought this because i played Garry's mod and was interested in it. didn't realize how fun it actually was.
Half-Life 2,Action,220,I've beaten this game twice. I've become addicted to the story. Thank you Valve for making such a masterpiece of a game. I feel like I can come back to this game anytime in my life and still enjoy it.

This game is one of the best games I've played in my life, it's been 5 years but this game feels like came out yesterday and there are so many details there, Mick Gordon the artist did pretty good job with his music in game you can barely feel time passing and you get motivation and feel bad-ass af, Definitely it is worthy of every cent of your money and you should experience this game till you are alive. Remember guys violence is not answer, it's a solution and it must be used in right way such as ripping and tearing demons in Hell. 
Don't forget to check my other reviews, PISS OUT!"
DOOM,Action,379720,The best shooter I´ve ever played (haven´t played Eternal)
DOOM,Action,379720,
DOOM,Action,379720,Sometimes you just want to rip and tear.
DOOM,Action,379720,yeah ok u kill zombies but why is there so many and why do they suck (not me though i win every time)
DOOM,Action,379720,"Fun for the whole family, do play this in front of children and old, christian people.
10/10"
DOOM,Action,379720,"the creatures are scary
"
DOOM,Action,379720,"Not deaf/HoH accessible in the slightest - subtitles are only for cutscenes, and do not provide in-game support for enemy noises, etc. Very unfortunate since this looks like a fun game otherwise."
DOOM,Action,379720,"This game is just SO. SATISFYING. Combat never stops. I love the kills and challenges. The enemies get tougher at a nice pace and really amps up at the end. Boss battles are incredible.

I'll probably play this again one day and just murder through it."
DOOM,Action,379720,"5 hours in, i was deciding to close the game and sleep, then BFG Division hit. I finished the game.

Only regret i've had is that is playing this after finishing Eternal. It would've made me love Eternal even more.
I've nothing bad to say about DOOM (2016), it is amazing. Worth the full-price. RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT'S DONE!"
DOOM,Action,379720,Your affinity for guns is apparent.
DOOM,Action,379720,hehe demon go splat
DOOM,Action,379720,"In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.

Tempered by the fires of Hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak. For he alone was the Hell Walker, the Unchained Predator, who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the slaves of Doom with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but demon had before.

And in his conquest against the blackened souls of the doomed, his prowess was shown. In his crusade, the seraphim bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the obsidian pillars of the Blood Temples. He set forth without pity upon the beasts of the nine circles. Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the Doom Slayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realm.

he age of his reckoning was uncounted. The scribes carved his name deep in the tablets of Hell across eons, and each battle etched terror in the hearts of the demons. They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked. For he alone could draw strength from his fallen foes, and ever his power grew, swift and unrelenting.

None could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer. Despair spread before him like a plague, striking fear into the shadow-dwellers, driving them to deeper and darker pits. But from the depths of the abyss rose The Great One, a champion mightier than all who had come before. The Titan, of immeasurable power and ferocity. He strode upon the plain and faced the Doom Slayer, and a mighty battle was fought on the desolate plains. The Titan fought with the fury of the countless that had fallen at the Doom Slayer's hand, but there fell the Titan, and in his defeat the shadow horde were routed.

And in his terrible rancor between worlds and through time, the Hell Walker found the wretch who shall not be named, but in his heresy was loyal to his evil cause. The wretch adorned the Doom Slayer in a mighty armor, wrought in the forges of Hell, impenetrable and unyielding. With sword and shield of adamantine strength, the Doom Slayer set to banishing all that were left unbroken by his savagery to the void. Yet as the mighty Titan fell and dread engulfed the armies of Doom, the demon priests of the Blood Temples laid a trap to capture this scourge of Hell. Insatiable, even by the vanquishing of the Great One, the Hell Walker sought prey in the tombs of the Blood Keep. And blinded by his fervor, the lure drew him in. The priests brought down the temple upon the Doom Slayer, and in his defeat entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus. The mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all of Hell that the terror within must never be freed. There he lies still, and ever more, in silent suffering."

Monster Hunter: World,RPG,582010,"What can I say about this game that hasn't been told already? First of all it's absolutely mind-blowing and impressive the amount of options and attention to detail put into this game. The game is really fun and was a joy to play with my friends.

Kill za monsters and then use their body parts to get better weapons and armor and then fight better monsters and use their parts for better weapons and armor. This is the gameplay loop.

I'll be honest this game is hard , some of these monsters will open a can of whoop-ass on you and you'll just be sitting there crying on the floor. You literally cannot spam any of your combos on the endgame monsters , how do you beat the monsters then? You learn their moveset , and when they take a breather after a strong attack and find a window to attack and punish their dumb ass. But if you get too greedy the monster will punish yo ass. Learning the patterns , dodging and punishing at the right time , the game forces you to master a fight , and it's really rewarding when you are belting a monster than tortured you for 10+ fights.

There's many playstyles and weapons you can play in this game , like greatsword : slow af , big hits , insect glaive : you have a vaulting pole you can maneuver easy , lower damage compared to GS , long sword : weeb katana. There's many more and many things the game won't even tell you like jumping off mushroom ledges and new attack combos.

I would say , if you can play with a friend or a group of friends , go for it. I would say it's a masterpiece , story is bad , that's not what it's for , The gameplay is gawwwd.

BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"A Good Story Is Everything That a Singleplayer game needs !!!
Bioshock Has This One :))))))"
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"I like the Bioshock franchise a lot, i've played all of the games multiple times.
I highly recomend this game to people that has played the earlier games in ther franchise."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Really fun bioshock game. If you have played the previous bioshock games, you would like this one. All the bioshock games are a masterpiece and its story is already top-tier. The graphics and audio are also on another level. This game really holds its own as one of the strongest story games ever. This game also ties in to the bioshock timeline and it was just really fun to experience and enjoy. I really recommend this game if you are looking for an eye opening experience. On a side note, this game is pretty hard to grind all the achievements."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Great game so far.....great story, great graphics (for low specs)......also 2 dlcs' are great.The ending of the main game is quite complex. Game play time is no so long but its time worthy."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,The first difficult combat story-based game that actually has your companion genuinely help you in combat.
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"That moment when you thought you'd finally have a girlfriend.. :(


10/10 would recommend to get heartbroken again!"
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"It nicely closes and ties together the story. I loved the ending.

It's different than the previous 2 instalments. You're no longer in a closed dark space, the world is brighter and more open. You don't carry around medkits anymore, there's no manual saving (auto save mechanics), you can only carry 2 weapons at the same time (you can easily find a new one pretty much anywhere). Most of all it did not crash at all for me, unlike bioshock 1 and 2."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,So I played a free copy of this potentially at some point on a PC... figured I'd send Irrational Games the $$ I owed them. Checked it out for 35 minutes but it lacked features that modern PC games typically have which made me not want to play. Also played it on Xbox. Really fun!
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Gameplay - 7/10
Story - 9/10
The gameplay is pretty good, although a bit lacking in a few aspects when compared to the previous instalments. The story and art style are the main focus and it did NOT disappoint one bit. Still ""The Burial at the Sea"" dlc complicated things way more than it needed to be and we probably would have been better off with a simpler dlc. All in all, I'd say its still far better than the plot of Bioshock 2 which was garbage (Minerva's Den was good)."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,I loved every second. END OF THE REVIEW
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,The base game is fun but it can be very confusing at times. I would recommend getting the DLCs. Overall great game.
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"The gameplay has some pacing and gameplay issues that many gamers might ignore while others will find mindly frustrating.
On top of that the main campaign completly neglects the storytelling and narrative that bioshock is famous for. However this game tells an emotional story and introduces nice twists like a good bioshock game should do. Thankfully many of the problems i had with the main campaign are not apparent in the 2 dlc that revolve around rapture .Its a good experience that is 100% worth its price when bought with the bioshock collection ."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,Best Game I have ever played
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,i want to fuck elizabeth
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Where do I begin. This game has it all: high fidelity graphics, thrilling gameplay, philosophy, paradoxical beauty, and politics. While I fear this review may become too long, I would be remiss if I skipped over any of these topics. 

Let's start from the top, shall we? The graphics. Wow, it's not often you think you are watching a movie while playing a game, but it's a common occurrence while playing Bioshock Infinity. What strikes me most is the extremely high fidelity, if one was asked to guess what year this game came out I wager most would say after the latter half of the decade, and they would be wrong. I myself am a bit of an expert on these things and am able to pinpoint the game came out in 2013, though that's not to say it doesn't look extremely impressive for its time. 

The gameplay is nothing short of the best of its generation. When I say thrilling, I really mean it. There are times when you are thousands of feet in the air, soaring above the Earth, while moving nauseatingly fast and in these moments you will need to keep a calm head and shoot your enemies. If that doesn't sound thrilling, then I don't know what does. Seriously more fun than most modern roller coasters.

There are several deep philosophical discussions present in the game, though since I do not want to spoil them for you I will focus only on one: imprisonment. At the core of the entire game there is a truth that lives with everyone. They are prisoners. Every citizen, every enemy, Elizabeth, even the player. Let me pose a question to you: if one wanted to be free of the floating city, how would they do it? There is no correct answer to this question, it was a trick. They are trapped in Columbia for the rest of their life. This game explores how a permanent state of imprisonment, and inability to become free, can change and mold a society. If you are curious how a society of prisoners living under the illusion they are free would grow, this video game is for you.

Paradoxical beauty is something that is difficult to put into prose, so bear with me for a moment while I turn to poetry:
Auburn sunrays sail the skies
warming buildings of all kinds
For above the Earth a city flies,
citizens restricted to its confines

And in this city of open lies
tread carefully around the fragile minds
Around the corner you hear their cries
as they pay homage to their shrines

If you thought freedom the ultimate prize
witness Columbia and its sinister design
For in this city you will be fine
should you submit to its unyielding binds.

Now, last but certainly not least, the politics. In all my years of playing video games, Bioshock Infinite has some of the deepest commentary you can find in any art. That's right, not just video games, but across all art. I do admit that at times it is not the most subtle of critiques but this does not hamper the effectiveness is any capacity. 

Early on in your adventure, you will wake up in ankle deep water in a church. You will hear a beautiful hymn as you collect yourself and try to find a way out. On your first encounter with another man, you will ask about your whereabouts, and he will respond, ""In heaven"". You will soon learn much about ""the prophet"", who seems an immensely important figure to the people praying. As you make your way into the world, you will hear the citizens make remarks about Columbia, all of them considering it the greatest, the highest, nation on Earth. You progress more, winning a raffle with a, in our modern eyes, disgusting prize: the opportunity to stone a couple because they are of different race. The game does not shy away from demonstrating how racist the populace is, as they cheer for the opportunity to stone the humiliated couple surrounded by racist imagery. What is all this a commentary on? It should be clear that it is early 1900s America, which I'm sure was obvious to the learned individual. In this review I cannot dive as deep as I would like into all the intricate details this game elegantly explores, because there is not enough space and I do not wish to bore you. 

Instead, I implore you to play this video game with a critical mind. I think it would be wise to do some background reading, I suggest the following: The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander, The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism by Edward Baptist, and The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion by Jonathan Haidt. Armed with only these books as foundational reading you should be able to fully grasp what Ken Levine and his team have managed with this game. 

Incredible. 10/10, take notes Rockstar."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"[b]Spoiler Free Review[/b]

My enjoyment of BioShock Infinite was not immediate, as the story starts out a little slow, but the deeper I got, the more I enjoyed it. The story, as well as the setting, was thought provoking from scientific, philosophical and social perspectives. I thought the voice acting and character development were fantastic, and the game was well worth every hour I put in. 

That's not to say it's a perfect game. The combat and movement systems felt a little dated for 2021, and the the auto-save feature is simply not good. As it's an older game, I think those are forgivable, but in the same light, I don't think you need to put down everything to play right now. If you can grab the game on sale, this story can make for a very enjoyable long weekend's worth of play."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,THE ENDING IS SUCH A BANGER WTF
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,the story is deep and as always with bio shock super intresting
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Cool story. Fun mechanics.

""Immersive"" is thrown around a lot, but it pretty much put me in the mindset that the story was driving. Would definitely recommend it to my friends, but they recommended it to me. It's probably best to go in blind like I did. 

Notes: Veteran at intermediate gaming. FPS is not my forte."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,10/10 this made me both cry and gave me a headache.
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"A Good Story Is Everything That a Singleplayer game needs !!!
Bioshock Has This One :))))))"
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"I like the Bioshock franchise a lot, i've played all of the games multiple times.
I highly recomend this game to people that has played the earlier games in ther franchise."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Really fun bioshock game. If you have played the previous bioshock games, you would like this one. All the bioshock games are a masterpiece and its story is already top-tier. The graphics and audio are also on another level. This game really holds its own as one of the strongest story games ever. This game also ties in to the bioshock timeline and it was just really fun to experience and enjoy. I really recommend this game if you are looking for an eye opening experience. On a side note, this game is pretty hard to grind all the achievements."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Great game so far.....great story, great graphics (for low specs)......also 2 dlcs' are great.The ending of the main game is quite complex. Game play time is no so long but its time worthy."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,The first difficult combat story-based game that actually has your companion genuinely help you in combat.
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"That moment when you thought you'd finally have a girlfriend.. :(


10/10 would recommend to get heartbroken again!"
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"It nicely closes and ties together the story. I loved the ending.

It's different than the previous 2 instalments. You're no longer in a closed dark space, the world is brighter and more open. You don't carry around medkits anymore, there's no manual saving (auto save mechanics), you can only carry 2 weapons at the same time (you can easily find a new one pretty much anywhere). Most of all it did not crash at all for me, unlike bioshock 1 and 2."
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,So I played a free copy of this potentially at some point on a PC... figured I'd send Irrational Games the $$ I owed them. Checked it out for 35 minutes but it lacked features that modern PC games typically have which made me not want to play. Also played it on Xbox. Really fun!
BioShock Infinite,Action,8870,"Gameplay - 7/10
Story - 9/10
The gameplay is pretty good, although a bit lacking in a few aspects when compared to the previous instalments. The story and art style are the main focus and it did NOT disappoint one bit. Still ""The Burial at the Sea"" dlc complicated things way more than it needed to be and we probably would have been better off with a simpler dlc. All in all, I'd say its still far better than the plot of Bioshock 2 which was garbage (Minerva's Den was good)."

Arma 3,Simulation,107410,"Well seeing as its the Arma franchise's 20 yeah anniversary i should probs write a review. So here goes:

Pro's

The sheir amount of teamwork in this game is unrivaled. From just 1 squad working to capture 1 objective. Too a  commander making several squads + 2 transport helicopters and a tank platoon work together.

Its a sandbox combined with a FPS. This is great because you can make literally anything in this game. If you can script in this game then the sky is the limit.

The sheir amount of mods that have been built up over the years. For example want to play DCS but dont have the money? Just download a the F-18 super hornet with a almost fully modelled cockpit. Or the fully modelled Apache and Blackhawk. 

The game engine is a funny of its own. Ever wanted to kill a tank by sending it to the stratosphere? Well just grab a quad bike and go full speed ahead.

Most computers can run this game. Yes i said it i do not care about the FPS argument, just turn ur render distance down. Someone in the community that i play with uses a 5 year old school laptop to play the game and he can clutch with his machine gun like a god. The only thing that will be bad is ur frame rate and graphics but hey who needs frame rate, its Arma after all.


Cons:

Your experience in this game heavely depends on the community that you find. Do not go for one of the hardcore milsim units is my advice, go for one of the casual or semi realism units. These are usually the best. I myself have found a nice casual unit that is the most fun experience ive had in this game.

Its a large scale game wich can make new players feel quite lost at first.

If you want to have a heart attack then try to open the controls menu. Although all these controls can be nice for experienced players, for new players its the number 1 complaint. 

Good luck and have fun!

Mount & Blade: Warband,Strategy,48700,"This game saved my life.

I am 60.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realise that.

Thank you"

Mount & Blade: Warband,Strategy,48700,"This game saved my life.

I am 60.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews.

It's hard
Challenging
Fast paced
Easy controls
Makes you think outside the box
Jack in the box
It makes you and forces you to change your tactics and forces you to stop being retarded 
If you die you restart but things are different
Smooth like butter
Not many games have the passion and dedication put in this game
Stop whining about it being hard 

Overall I love this game"

Dead Cells,Indie,588650,fantastic
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"the game is fun and good quality rougelike 
its just so very often the design is plain stupid. 
when game which one of main features is speed and tempo, puts you spikes beneath some drop outside of your FOV it makes you mad.
when creature which shoot through walls shoot at you outside of your FOV its plain stupid design.

after 80 hours i just cant anymore 
to much stupid level designs to much rage to much bitter feeling.

never felt that with Hollow knight 
never ever felt that with Hades

i constantly leave the game in rage just because i dont feel that the F ups is my mistakes 
usually its some game design that F you scummy way and they call it ""challenge""

the FOV is poor, NO WIDESCREEN option (they said it will be cheating in a way). 
well i guess limit your fov the way you cant see the danger is the right way in their vision. 

il give you example 

in a game after you kill enemies fast enough you will get a limited but major speed buff that will replenish for each kill afterward, you will get the tempo and will fly as fast as you can.
now, as you run some times you will climb up or drop down, both ways the FOV just so limited that you will get hit hurt or killed by something something just cause you didnt saw it.
if you drop down its even more stupid, you can drop slow and get fall stun at the landing or you can hard drop with power smash at the ground.
this is when they like to put some spikes beneath. 

the intuition is lost, like sonic games when the game is all about the speed and tempo but when you got the speed the game is punish you with some unseen spikes or bullshit enemies that shoot you beyond your FOV

its not challenge its unfair 
as i said NEVER felt that with HADES never with Hollow Knight every fail felt fair and my mistake."

There are so many things I really love about this game: all these different enemy types, the many many many weapons and skills , the absolutely beautiful graphics, the smooth and satisfying animations and gameplay.
You can explore new things with every new run and if you're up to it you can increase the difficulty, so it's still fun, even after a long while. 
There's no right way to play this game, you can find your own and I really like that (: 
(also: buy the DLC's)"
Dead Cells,Indie,588650,"This game is a bit hard at the beginning, but once you get the hang of it, it is awesome. It gets harder again when you increase the difficulty, but that makes the game challenging. It might seem a bit repetitive, but with a lot of options of weaponry, the game is playable over and over again. An extra plus point, you can quit whenever, wherever you want and resume when you want to( though i never tried quiting during a boss fight :) )."

But until then - it was a perfect game, demanding but fair, with almost no need for thinking so I could easily play and listen to an audio book at the same time.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"I think this game deserves a rightful deep insight because its no easy task after being overloaded by it. The importance of it nowadays, the example it sets for gaming and why you should reserve this game a special place so you don't miss all the fun.

[code] 𝐈𝐓 𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐏𝐄𝐂𝐓𝐒 𝐘𝐎𝐔 𝐀𝐒 𝐀 𝐆𝐀𝐌𝐄𝐑 𝐑𝐀𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐑 𝐓𝐇𝐀𝐍 𝐉𝐔𝐒𝐓 𝐀 𝐂𝐔𝐒𝐓𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐑 [/code]

I can see how one influences another, but the story mode isn't harmed so Online can exist, you’re not going to be harassed by any micro transactions while on singleplayer. The Online is just a choice by definition, you even have the option to turn off friend’s invites. There will be no propaganda of other games in the menu either, like Ubisoft and Capcom usually do. There is no immersion breaking items demanding you to PRETEND they aren't there.

I was afraid of buying this because I was skeptical that a game could be better than RDR1 with John Marston. I also avoided it due the highly inflated price in my country (bolsonaro vai tomar no cú). The current sellout discount this month was my best chance. This game is a perfected RDR1 if such witchery is even possible.


[h1]𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐁𝐄𝐒𝐓 𝐎𝐅 𝐈𝐌𝐌𝐄𝐑𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍 - 𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐋𝐃'𝐒 𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐒𝐓[/h1]

If you’re not an immersive gamer, you’ll learn to be. There are a lot of gameplay mechanics to suit every gamer but they’re so intuitive and sophisticated, it tends to incentivize you to adjust to a survival hybrid. You can be the good-bad guy (the canon R* expects from you), be a chill Boomhauer or just be the bad-bad guy. Sneak, bomb, kill, hunt, whatever you wish or if chaos suits you, even the smallest of things got a lot to show as you have probably heard already.

Now while the Online game preserves some of it, surely isn't the same direction. You can fully customize a character but he/she lacks voice for logical reasons, thus no substance (it has story progression) but things are much less dense & less interesting for me. Not my thing to wait for unpredictable randoms, but fun-guarantee with known friends. Again, it is a different driving force in there that requires a mood I don't always have.

When it comes to feelings however, assuming you were convinced to accept the story's pace, you'll have time to feel incredible moments and to see beautiful places, especially with decent graphics. Not everything will depend on it though, only a few games can break the boundary between here and “there” merely by some flow. The adverb stands for “where and when” the game is taking place but also ""how"".

[code] 𝐊𝐄𝐘 𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐃: 𝐓𝐑𝐈𝐁𝐀𝐋 [/code]

Many tribes consider wolves to be related to humans, because of the wolf’s dedication to its pack. Loneliness can trigger immersion, sometimes it is the world or the time period, sometimes it's everything combined. RDR2 story mode has all that, but it also adds bounding. A gang can trigger unique immersion, until the point of feeling at home, then you know the writer was inspired, voice and body actors were on fire and the development team resonated. As important as “your people” are, so must be “your foe”, giving reasons and further tightening that bounding.

This isn’t my first time feeling it. Comradery is also in many other games like Mass Effect, Republic Commando, FC Primal, even Lost and Damned and Cyberpunk nomads living in my soul. But it is definitely the first time I feel it in my blood.

If you wish to get high with such sweet endorphins, you can start by dealing with what you don't believe. Like killing, brawling or robbing imprudently (you will do that a lot) or fall to redemption. Of course I despise gangsters but I can see why they can't fit in. So, it is easy to find spatial immersion, but easy to get it busted too. Someone may storm your room, maybe your neighbor is a noisy ass messing with your focus or perhaps your cat is very sick today. Until they’re gone or if you go fix them, and of course, you must pay attention to the story 😂 If you think immersion is for crazies, here’s what [b]J.R.R. Tolkien[/b] once said about the importance of suspension of disbelief;

[i]""[The author] makes a secondary world which your mind can enter. Inside it, what he relates is true: it accords with the laws of that world. You therefore believe it, while you are, as it were inside. The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather art, has failed. You are then out in the primary world again, looking at the little abortive secondary world from outside.""[/i]

If you think Tolkien was crazy at least you’d respect him more than you respect me.

[h1]𝐖𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐄 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐑𝐎𝐂𝐊𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐑 𝐒𝐎𝐏𝐇𝐈𝐒𝐓𝐈𝐂𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐈𝐒[/h1]

[olist][*]Options are as complete as GTA V, you can tweak a lot of things from controllers to color blind. Every game should give you these options specially for keyboard gamers to adjust.

[*]After GTA V for PC, the first person perspective became a regular option as the third person still is the default one. That's the quality bar Rockstar has set.

[*]If you’re investing in new hardware, your sacrifices will be really worthy. I usually criticize R* porting to PC, even if you still can’t peak 60 fps you’re going to blow away anyway.

[*]All the galloping and walking physics & animations are so incredibly realistic on snow, slopes and et cætera they tend to glitch when you take it too hard. If you are unpredictable, take it easy.

[*]My nerd senses indicate a hundred scripts are running in the background, one of the reasons why I prefer story mode. When I first had a lucky hunt, the camp was visibly happier, more active. I don’t know what black sorcery stabilizes it, for it is polished enough to stand most of it.

[*]The musicians did a phenomenal job transferring non-gaming culture. My jaw is always dropping, but the first action music that played crashed into outdated mufflers as if I was watching Bonanza or something, shockingly good.

[*]Detail is a self-interacting multi-cell organism without precedents. From animals eyes reflecting light, to fruits falling from trees.

There are enough reviews out there that tell you that this game is a [b]very good game.[/b]

The usual points being that the game is a slow burn.
That's true because it [b]is.[/b]

But it is made to be that way so that you have time to slowly get to know the characters that are introduced to you. Slowly you begin to form your own biases and conclusions for each character as Arthur interacts with them.

You make decisions that will impact how everyone sees you and how everyone will treat you. Though I would have wanted to explore that a bit more, your decisions are gonna be influenced by the karma meter. I would have liked to be able to stay right in the middle,
like a grey moral area between good cowboy and bad cowboy but oh well.

The graphics are amazing, let's just get that out of the way. It looks great, the weather system is a little fast sometimes but not too jarring. The biomes that simulate the arid areas, the cold areas and the more temperate areas are superbly done. I especially hate the swamp lands cause it gives me that gross humid feeling and it is frankly pretty great since its able to make me feel that way.

Clothing options aplenty but with some limitations. Truly the endgame is to be able to dress up in many different outfits and be able to put on different looks whenever the mood strikes you. There's a decent amount of clothes you can layer but sometimes the physics kind of bug out. This part specifically for the online version cause the tail coats have a bug that give your character some ""extra cake"". 

There is a good selection of playable guns and I love the fact that you can customize them as well. Who wouldn't wanna ride off in the sunset with a pair of golden revolvers? Pearl handles too. [i]Fancy.[/i]

If the first few hours of the game don't hook you in, you might not enjoy the rest of the actual game. If you're struggling to make it past the first bit, I urge you to trudge along and at least give it a fair chance. It gets a lot more fun, trust me. 

Oh the free roaming is great. You can ignore the storyline completely so that you can just ride around RP-ing as a cowboy or whatever you wanna do. Standard rockstar open world but no cars, only horses.

The best part that I like about RDR2 is the hunting.
You can just chill out and instead of doing the usual thing where you shoot people,
you can just go hunting instead, stalk your prey, strike and skin 'em. Make 'em into clothes 'n stuff.

Go fishing, catch some good eats. Avoid getting bodied by a crocodile.

Just remember.

Be rootin'
be tootin'
and above all
[b]be shootin'[/b]


Also RDO is kinda [u]meh.[/u]
So many cheaters.


RDR2 = 9/10"
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"A real living breathing world. One of if not the most immersive game worlds ever created, though it is a very slow game because its almost like being there in the old west for real. Some may like that, others may love the immersion.

It has some of the most realistic NPCs with actual AI that works, which seems rare for games of today. You can even talk to every NPC and there is a lot of interaction.

It also has, while small considering its the old west, the most immersive towns and ""cities"" (for the time period) ever created in a game. The towns are amazing, and never have I seen such amazing detail with so much interaction, realism and actual npcs that look like they belong there in towns/cities that know how to move out of your way than I have this game.

Definitely highly recommended if you are looking for a highly immersive, slow paced game, where you can actually feel like you are really living in the old west."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Even though the game has been out for awhile, I held off on buying it as I was not interested at initial release.
I finally decided to take a real long look at the game, game play and reviews out there. Those pushed me over the edge and I now have RDR2 in my Library.

Let me start by saying the game still costs a premium price for as long as it has been out. That might scare some off who have tight budgets. However, for me, it is one of those games that is still worth the cost.

You are not going to finish this game quickly and feel like it cost #20.oo a day to finish a game in 3 days, something I have experienced too often.  This thing takes some time, and it is time well spent. 
The story is rich and engaging. I find the main character, Arthur Morgan, to be fascinating and entertaining as I play along. He draws you in to the game, a game rich in story.
Now the graphics, well, they are beautiful. With my RTX 3080 from Asus, I am running this game fulling Optimized through G-force Experience and still get over 100 fps at 1440p. 

Replay value on this game will be great too. I can see me playing it several times over, changing outcomes along the way by my actions just to see what happens. Now I don't feel bad about the price at all!

Looking for a game rich in story, long playing with great replay value, excellent graphics, entertaining as all get out? Here it is...................... you're welcome! :-)"
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,THIS IS A GOOD LOOKING GAME
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"First i have to start by saying that this game is a masterpiece. This is the first game i have taken 100 screenshots in the first 10 hours of the game. 
Playing as Arthur was the best thing in a game because he is one of the best protagonist i have played as.
The animations and the voice actors just fit so good one with each other. This is the first game in a long time that made me do every possible mission. The side quests are so well done. Some of them change some things in the story mode.

 Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel of the first Red Dead Redemption and it's a good this cause we finally saw what happened to the gang that John was in. And now a lot of things make more sense in the first one.
Red Dead Online it's a prequel of a prequel, it's really weird. Online it's not bad, but it's hard for new players to make the gold and money. And it needs some heists/robberies but other then that it's good.

The graphics and visuals of the game are astonishing and really well made.
The gameplay it's just so good like no other game.
The soundtrack just amazing and really well fitted. A really great choice with the western like vibe of the music and game.

I fell in love with the game in the first 2 hours of it because it's just so good.
 I played like 10-12 hours per day cause it's great. No game really made me do that.  That's how much i love it. I don't regret buying this game. I bought it on sale for 40 euros. The best decision. The game is worth every penny you have. I hope they will port Red Dead Redemption to pc so i can play it or maybe a remake or remastered version of it and maybe Undead Nightmare 1&2.
So if you have the money buy the game it's worth it.
If you want to look at the screenshots that i have, some are spoilers so be carefull."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,My anus itches with joy
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,long and nice story
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Thumbs up, but sucks that the game only offers perks to morally good choices. I want to be evil."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"happy but sad, can't explain my pain"
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"So, RDR2 consists of two modes, Story and Online.

[b]Story[/b] - is simply incredible. Not only it features a solid and really dramatic plotline, the amount of details in this game is beyond any comparison. From your first hours in this game you will literally FEEL much love and dedication devs have put in it. Lots of stuff to do, explore and complete. It's interesting, it's enjoyable, its fun. Overall - really deep and really entertaining, very much recommending it, worth it's full price without any doubt.

[b]Online[/b] - well, now it becames problematic. It's simply too shallow comparing to singleplayer. In general your gameplay in RDO consists of two things - missions and competitive sessions like deathmatch or races. Even so caled ""roles"" are basically sets of different missions, some of them are nice and interesting, most of them are your typical fetch-kill quests. RDO also has story missions, they are kinda okay, but nothing special either. What's really bad about RDO - its people, who are playing it, since in 90% of player interactions you will be one-shot instantly from a sniper rifle long before you actually see who did this. Which in turn forces even the peaceful players to behave the same and kill first to avoid being killed. Game is full of griefers and cheaters, Rockstar doesn't give a single about them, as they never did in GTA:O. Thus the same ""pull the plug"" countermeasures which worked in GTA:O are working (and recommended) here too. It's also filled with minor, but extremely annoying bugs, the game is really unstable at times. In general - it's playable, sometimes enjoyable but lacks any memorable moments apart from really toxic ones which you won't be really happy to remember at all.

Thus, as friendly advice - don't buy standalone RDO, just buy this full version for it's Story mode in mind and you'll be good."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"I first played this game on Xbox 4-5 months ago, and I can honestly say that this is the best game that I've ever played, and probably always will be. I never thought that I'd love a game this much, it's absolutely amazing! I'm not just talking about the story here, the graphics, the music, the details, the world itself...but man, the story ""CHEFFS KISS"". You can tell that this game was made with love, and passion, by overworked RockStar employees (no sarcasm intended). I never thought a game like this could exsist. You might think that I'm exaggerating, but damn it, I'm not! I cried for 2 hours when I finished this game (not the epilogue part, tho that made me cry too). Then I tried explaining why I cried so much to my parents, and I teared up again. I was depressed and empty for 2 fucking weeks, this game wrecked me! OK, so basically this game made soft, but damn it, it's worth it. The side characters, every litte story, every main mission, every detail, John Marston, and esspecially the one and only ARTHUR MORGAN were absolutely amazing! 
I never got attached to a character like this. He became one of my all time favorite fictional characters ever. 
I know that the price is a little bit high, but it's worth every penny of it. Definitely buy this game, and not watch story walkthroughs, cuz it's a whole other experience when you play it yourself. I can talk about this game for hours and hours, but I'm not gonna. So just buy the fricking game, and enjoy it."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,Such an amazing game. Must play if you love Single Player mode.
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,this game is super fucking long and thats a good thing 
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,Masterpiece
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"basically yee-haw GTA V, instead of helicopters and rocket launchers you have horses and cool revolvers."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,Arthur Morgan is such a chad you almost forget he isnt a reel human bean
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"mainly played on the playstation.
honestly one of the best stories ive seen in a game, an amazing experience.

red dead online, however, is more or less a grindy cash grab."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,yes
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"I think this game deserves a rightful deep insight because its no easy task after being overloaded by it. The importance of it nowadays, the example it sets for gaming and why you should reserve this game a special place so you don't miss all the fun.

I can see how one influences another, but the story mode isn't harmed so Online can exist, you’re not going to be harassed by any micro transactions while on singleplayer. The Online is just a choice by definition, you even have the option to turn off friend’s invites. There will be no propaganda of other games in the menu either, like Ubisoft and Capcom usually do. There is no immersion breaking items demanding you to PRETEND they aren't there.

I was afraid of buying this because I was skeptical that a game could be better than RDR1 with John Marston. I also avoided it due the highly inflated price in my country (bolsonaro vai tomar no cú). The current sellout discount this month was my best chance. This game is a perfected RDR1 if such witchery is even possible.


[h1]𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐁𝐄𝐒𝐓 𝐎𝐅 𝐈𝐌𝐌𝐄𝐑𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍 - 𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐋𝐃'𝐒 𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐒𝐓[/h1]

If you’re not an immersive gamer, you’ll learn to be. There are a lot of gameplay mechanics to suit every gamer but they’re so intuitive and sophisticated, it tends to incentivize you to adjust to a survival hybrid. You can be the good-bad guy (the canon R* expects from you), be a chill Boomhauer or just be the bad-bad guy. Sneak, bomb, kill, hunt, whatever you wish or if chaos suits you, even the smallest of things got a lot to show as you have probably heard already.

Now while the Online game preserves some of it, surely isn't the same direction. You can fully customize a character but he/she lacks voice for logical reasons, thus no substance (it has story progression) but things are much less dense & less interesting for me. Not my thing to wait for unpredictable randoms, but fun-guarantee with known friends. Again, it is a different driving force in there that requires a mood I don't always have.

When it comes to feelings however, assuming you were convinced to accept the story's pace, you'll have time to feel incredible moments and to see beautiful places, especially with decent graphics. Not everything will depend on it though, only a few games can break the boundary between here and “there” merely by some flow. The adverb stands for “where and when” the game is taking place but also ""how"".

[code] 𝐊𝐄𝐘 𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐃: 𝐓𝐑𝐈𝐁𝐀𝐋 [/code]

Many tribes consider wolves to be related to humans, because of the wolf’s dedication to its pack. Loneliness can trigger immersion, sometimes it is the world or the time period, sometimes it's everything combined. RDR2 story mode has all that, but it also adds bounding. A gang can trigger unique immersion, until the point of feeling at home, then you know the writer was inspired, voice and body actors were on fire and the development team resonated. As important as “your people” are, so must be “your foe”, giving reasons and further tightening that bounding.

This isn’t my first time feeling it. Comradery is also in many other games like Mass Effect, Republic Commando, FC Primal, even Lost and Damned and Cyberpunk nomads living in my soul. But it is definitely the first time I feel it in my blood.

If you wish to get high with such sweet endorphins, you can start by dealing with what you don't believe. Like killing, brawling or robbing imprudently (you will do that a lot) or fall to redemption. Of course I despise gangsters but I can see why they can't fit in. So, it is easy to find spatial immersion, but easy to get it busted too. Someone may storm your room, maybe your neighbor is a noisy ass messing with your focus or perhaps your cat is very sick today. Until they’re gone or if you go fix them, and of course, you must pay attention to the story 😂 If you think immersion is for crazies, here’s what [b]J.R.R. Tolkien[/b] once said about the importance of suspension of disbelief;

[i]""[The author] makes a secondary world which your mind can enter. Inside it, what he relates is true: it accords with the laws of that world. You therefore believe it, while you are, as it were inside. The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather art, has failed. You are then out in the primary world again, looking at the little abortive secondary world from outside.""[/i]

If you think Tolkien was crazy at least you’d respect him more than you respect me.

[h1]𝐖𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐄 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐑𝐎𝐂𝐊𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐑 𝐒𝐎𝐏𝐇𝐈𝐒𝐓𝐈𝐂𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐈𝐒[/h1]

[olist][*]Options are as complete as GTA V, you can tweak a lot of things from controllers to color blind. Every game should give you these options specially for keyboard gamers to adjust.

[*]After GTA V for PC, the first person perspective became a regular option as the third person still is the default one. That's the quality bar Rockstar has set.

[*]If you’re investing in new hardware, your sacrifices will be really worthy. I usually criticize R* porting to PC, even if you still can’t peak 60 fps you’re going to blow away anyway.

[*]All the galloping and walking physics & animations are so incredibly realistic on snow, slopes and et cætera they tend to glitch when you take it too hard. If you are unpredictable, take it easy.

[*]My nerd senses indicate a hundred scripts are running in the background, one of the reasons why I prefer story mode. When I first had a lucky hunt, the camp was visibly happier, more active. I don’t know what black sorcery stabilizes it, for it is polished enough to stand most of it.

[*]The musicians did a phenomenal job transferring non-gaming culture. My jaw is always dropping, but the first action music that played crashed into outdated mufflers as if I was watching Bonanza or something, shockingly good.

[*]Detail is a self-interacting multi-cell organism without precedents. From animals eyes reflecting light, to fruits falling from trees. NPCs even save reactions for later, I saw 19th century brats in the alleys, dogs trying to dig under the fence. This is what an historian artist can do when he has the $ dinero.

[*]Here’s hoping RDR1 will be remastered for PC one day and a solo game with Black Belle, cowgirls are badasses too. We like action and westerns are the best. More time passes, the more it stays the same.[/olist]

The animations and the voice actors just fit so good one with each other. This is the first game in a long time that made me do every possible mission. The side quests are so well done. Some of them change some things in the story mode.

 Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel of the first Red Dead Redemption and it's a good this cause we finally saw what happened to the gang that John was in. And now a lot of things make more sense in the first one.
Red Dead Online it's a prequel of a prequel, it's really weird. Online it's not bad, but it's hard for new players to make the gold and money. And it needs some heists/robberies but other then that it's good.

The graphics and visuals of the game are astonishing and really well made.
The gameplay it's just so good like no other game.
The soundtrack just amazing and really well fitted. A really great choice with the western like vibe of the music and game.

I fell in love with the game in the first 2 hours of it because it's just so good.
 I played like 10-12 hours per day cause it's great. No game really made me do that.  That's how much i love it. I don't regret buying this game. I bought it on sale for 40 euros. The best decision. The game is worth every penny you have. I hope they will port Red Dead Redemption to pc so i can play it or maybe a remake or remastered version of it and maybe Undead Nightmare 1&2.
So if you have the money buy the game it's worth it.
If you want to look at the screenshots that i have, some are spoilers so be carefull."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,My anus itches with joy
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,long and nice story
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Thumbs up, but sucks that the game only offers perks to morally good choices. I want to be evil."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"happy but sad, can't explain my pain"
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"So, RDR2 consists of two modes, Story and Online.

[b]Story[/b] - is simply incredible. Not only it features a solid and really dramatic plotline, the amount of details in this game is beyond any comparison. From your first hours in this game you will literally FEEL much love and dedication devs have put in it. Lots of stuff to do, explore and complete. It's interesting, it's enjoyable, its fun. Overall - really deep and really entertaining, very much recommending it, worth it's full price without any doubt.

[b]Online[/b] - well, now it becames problematic. It's simply too shallow comparing to singleplayer. In general your gameplay in RDO consists of two things - missions and competitive sessions like deathmatch or races. Even so caled ""roles"" are basically sets of different missions, some of them are nice and interesting, most of them are your typical fetch-kill quests. RDO also has story missions, they are kinda okay, but nothing special either. What's really bad about RDO - its people, who are playing it, since in 90% of player interactions you will be one-shot instantly from a sniper rifle long before you actually see who did this. Which in turn forces even the peaceful players to behave the same and kill first to avoid being killed. Game is full of griefers and cheaters, Rockstar doesn't give a single about them, as they never did in GTA:O. Thus the same ""pull the plug"" countermeasures which worked in GTA:O are working (and recommended) here too. It's also filled with minor, but extremely annoying bugs, the game is really unstable at times. In general - it's playable, sometimes enjoyable but lacks any memorable moments apart from really toxic ones which you won't be really happy to remember at all.

Thus, as friendly advice - don't buy standalone RDO, just buy this full version for it's Story mode in mind and you'll be good."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"I first played this game on Xbox 4-5 months ago, and I can honestly say that this is the best game that I've ever played, and probably always will be. I never thought that I'd love a game this much, it's absolutely amazing! I'm not just talking about the story here, the graphics, the music, the details, the world itself...but man, the story ""CHEFFS KISS"". You can tell that this game was made with love, and passion, by overworked RockStar employees (no sarcasm intended). I never thought a game like this could exsist. You might think that I'm exaggerating, but damn it, I'm not! I cried for 2 hours when I finished this game (not the epilogue part, tho that made me cry too). Then I tried explaining why I cried so much to my parents, and I teared up again. I was depressed and empty for 2 fucking weeks, this game wrecked me! OK, so basically this game made soft, but damn it, it's worth it. The side characters, every litte story, every main mission, every detail, John Marston, and esspecially the one and only ARTHUR MORGAN were absolutely amazing! 
I never got attached to a character like this. He became one of my all time favorite fictional characters ever. 
I know that the price is a little bit high, but it's worth every penny of it. Definitely buy this game, and not watch story walkthroughs, cuz it's a whole other experience when you play it yourself. I can talk about this game for hours and hours, but I'm not gonna. So just buy the fricking game, and enjoy it."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,Such an amazing game. Must play if you love Single Player mode.
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,this game is super fucking long and thats a good thing 
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,Masterpiece
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"basically yee-haw GTA V, instead of helicopters and rocket launchers you have horses and cool revolvers."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,Arthur Morgan is such a chad you almost forget he isnt a reel human bean
Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"mainly played on the playstation.
honestly one of the best stories ive seen in a game, an amazing experience.

red dead online, however, is more or less a grindy cash grab."

Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"Listen, Deep Rock is a fun, well-made game with incredible character customization and amazing developer support at an extremely reasonable price, but here's why it's my FAVORITE game: More than once, I have interrupted a mission with ""y'all I'm so sorry my cat wants something I'll be right back,"" and every SINGLE time, the random people I am playing with have responded with some version of, ""of course!!! give your cat a good skritch from me!!!"" Truly one of the friendliest and most welcoming online gaming communities I have ever had the pleasure of partaking in.

Can you have an intense, challenging run'n'gun shooter experience in DRG? Absolutely, thanks to the game's excellent modular difficulty. But my favorite thing is setting a mission on the just-right-to-me difficulty of Hazard Level 3, hosting a public game, and meeting some chill people. How many games can boast an experience like that?

Fellow miners: Rock and stone!"
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,Rock and stone
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"""Press V to cheer"" is the best dedicated button since ""press Z to poop"" in ARK: Survival Evolved. 

While this may seem like a mining and gunning simulator, it is in fact a state of the art ""cracking open a cold one with the boys"" simulator. Grab a group of friends and set out into beautiful alien caverns to mine gold and minerals, and collect eggs and fossils, and blast away a some creepy crawlies."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"Just buy it, don't even think twice about it."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"An absolute masterclass of co-op game design. Every class feels distinct and purposeful to the point where having a full composition is nigh essential to having the complete DRG experience. Every gadget you have will benefit the whole team in one way or another. Every weapon is impactful and fills a specific niche on top of being customizable to fit any gamestyle you'd hope to accomplish. Nothing feels weak and your performance will not depend on which weapons you will carry, but how you'll use them. Enemies are recognizable even from afar and have clear weakpoints and resistances. Dwarves are very much talkative and will comment on their situations, as well as throw banter around. Every biome is different from one another and, along with the random cave generation, will help make every run feel unique in its own way. Gamemodes are varied and fun and will supply you with countless hours of mining bliss. Cosmetics, pickaxe parts, weapons and modifications are all unlockable. Nothing is locked behind a paywall, except for some cosmetic packs that only serve to support the devs who, frankly, deserve every penny coming to them. The replay value is off the charts and you'll always find something new to do. Get 3 friends and play the game and you'll have a blast! And even if you don't have anyone to play with, the community is second to none and you'll eventually make friends just playing online. If you're looking to go solo, the game offers a bot called ""Bosco"" that can accompany you on your endeavours. Bosco can mine, shine his light, dig tunnels, carry minerals and even terminate bugs *with extreme prejudice*!

You're gravely missing out if you don't buy Deep Rock Galactic NOW! Join the union and you'll be downing beers with your fellow dwarves in no time. And remember, if you don't Rock and Stone, you ain't coming home!"

Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"Dwarfs? Big insect swarms? Endless booze? Sign me up! Good game single player, but this game definitely shines in random pubs or with a group of friends fighting the endless swarms of bugs that want to eat your face.

Plenty of unlocks for each character, weapons, cosmetics and mods."

The game is well paced, I am 150 hours in now and have accomplished alot, but still got things to uncover and build up. It's a blast, for both casual fun and stressfull, yet rewarding, high difficulty gameplay. Noone forces you to go into higher threat levels, but you get your rewards faster if you do. Rewards you choose yourself.

I am amazed by the detail and love you put into your game. Little things most players will probably gloss over, like hidden voicelines and sparking cables in the Rig... stuff like that makes the game feel alive, without adding any convoluted story or complexity. Thank you. Thank you for your subtlety."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"One of the best co-op games ever! DRG has a nice community of players. It's super rare to run into someone who is actually toxic.

The layouts always feel fresh to me and I still get amazed by some of the rooms (and the sheer size of some of them).

Shooting bugs and mining morkite in about 10 different ways never gets old. Overall, the game is one of the best ones i've played, and coming back to it from the beta I can see the love and effort from caring devs oozing out from every corner."
Deep Rock Galactic,Action,548430,"I think this is one of the best games I've gotten into in a good while, its design nails a lot of things incredibly well into place. Enemy design and variety coupled with the procedurally generated caves, affected by the selected mission type, compliment each other well in creating new situations to endure through every dive. The classes and perk system compliment each other making every class well capable in any role from DPS to support, none of the classes really feel necessary in an usual sense. 

On topic of perks the game's progression system is quite engaging with multiple separate mechanics tied to different means of upgrading your dwarves. The standard weapon upgrades seem to mostly fall somewhere on a line between DPS and survivability, both being valid choices. The dripfeed of content via additional overclocks for your weapons makes it worth to wait for each cycle of weeklies and deep dives. Everyone is on equal footing on the RNG of this side, it's completely free from lootboxes or mictrotransactions. Every core you get is guaranteed to be a new unique find.

Cosmetics are an important part of Deep Rock, more than in any other video game as they are all tied into continuing to play, barring a few little cosmetic DLC. The great majority of items are still part of the base game. It makes it surprisingly satisfying to come up with a flashy new getup for your miner or when you salute with whatever almost ceremonial pickaxe design. Stone and rock."

- Speaking of updates: the developers keep adding more stuff into the game for the low price of [b] ZERO [/b] [i] insert currency here [/i]. The only ""DLC"" on the store page is some cosmetic packs.

All the maps are randomly generated, there's a wide variety of monsters and different objectives/mission types. This combined makes it so that no single mission ever feels the same as any previous one.

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"When I first got the game, I liked it.  Then I met the first mini-boss and died a lot.  I got better.  Watched quite a few walk-throughs and tips videos.  I hated everything about it.  The I-frames, the enemy fight timings, the death mechanics, the Ogre...oh! that damnable, stinking ogre!  I never hated a character more until I had to fight Lady Butterfly.  Then about 20 hours in, I just got it.  I understood.  Then I was able to appreciate the landscapes, the quests, and the story line. I got my platinum in about 43 hours.  I've played through about 38 times, conquered all DLC gauntlets, and still love playing it.  I can now do a full run through in about 10 hours if I play all the side quests and kill all there is to kill.  Still hate the Headless though.  1007 hours and still love it.  I probably can't play anything else that From Software has now, but that is okay.  I'll still give the Souls series a try at some point.  Looking forward to Elden Ring."

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, A game developed by FromSoftware and published by Activision.

Anyone who knows me, Knows i am a tremendous Soulsborne fan, so when Sekiro came out, you can imagine i jumped at the chance to get into it. I however was severely disappointed initially, the game was nothing like Demon or Dark Souls or even Bloodborne in the slightest. I thought this was a down side, Until recently i got into the game again. Picked up back up, blew off the dust and discovered beneath its new formula was a game unlike anything i'd ever experienced before.
This review contains no spoilers, and only briefly touches on the base story plot line.
So with no further hesitation, Sekiro.

[h1]Story: 9/10[/h1]
Soulsborne games are notoriously bad at their actual story telling. The games never provide any actual information or lore and everything you learn you have to do through either item flavour text or through assumptions. Sekiro is nothing like that, It has a very forward way of story telling, and it's pretty much fed to you as you continue the story. For the finer details you need to talk with NPC's and discover them on your own but the underlying plot is continuously unfolding throughout your playtime. You play as Wolf, a shinobi who has to find his Master, and escape your homeland of Ashina. As you can imagine this is far from a easy task and this will continue to pull you through until your final objective is made clear.

[h1]Gameplay: 9/10[/h1]
[b]+ Movement:[/b] Sekiro takes the soulsborne formula to a totally different height (Pun not intended), no longer is the game bound to the X and Y axis, but also now the Z. Fights and world exploration will take place on a totally open plane. And to assist with this, you have all means of movement to help you navigate it, such as grappling hooks and swimming mechanics, allowing both highest of heights and darkest of depths to be experienced.
[b]+ Combat:[/b] What makes Sekiro great, truly wonderful and unique in its own right, Is it's combat. Combat here is not just a means to defeat the enemy. It's art. Watching someone truly good at the game is a truly breath taking experience, and even noticing your own improvements can be mind boggling in their own right. You don't realise how far you've come in such a short period until you've overcome an obstacle that has blocked you for countless hours. This is the epitome of melee combat from any game i have ever played, where even the smallest mistake can break you, and even the smoothest of runs can be undone in the matter of seconds. Unlike the other games of this genre, boss fights aren't just about running in and slashing at the boss, it's about deflecting his with a perfect parry and executing a precise counter and repeating until you have achieved victory.
[b]+ Difficulty:[/b] I have to mention that i wasn't sure if this should be a positive or a negative point. But through a much decisive afternoon of drafting this review, i have decided it's a ""for"" rather than ""against"", And here is why. The difficulty is purely modular, And what i mean about this is that you have almost complete control over it. While the base difficulty of the game is pretty decent on its own, it isn't the only difficulty, it can be significantly increased with the use of 2 specific in game items (If you want more information, please feel free to ask). But also the game allows you to increase both your health and damage output on a scale by completing tasks. Even though its still limited.
[b]+ Boss Fights:[/b] All Soulsborne games have boss fights, its a part of the series that makes everyone pay attention. The boss fights in the Soulsborne games are considered to be amongst the hardest bosses from any game ever, And Sekiro doesn't defer away from this mindset, In this game i have encountered some of possibly the hardest and most frustration inducing bosses i have ever witnessed. But in that comes something truly magical, the overcoming of the challenge which is truly sensational in this game.
[b]+ World Design:[/b] World design has always been a huge thing for me, the world has to be designed with both attention to detail and also viable for mobility. Sekiro achieves both of these phenomenally, as you would both imagine and hope from a game of this style.
[b]- Dragonrot:[/b] The only bad thing in an otherwise perfect game. And although i understand its lore purpose and the reasoning for its existence. It's incredibly off putting at the start. Dragonrot is a disease that spreads throughout your game world the more you die, a punishment for failure. Although its relatively easily circumvented with the use of a limited in game item, it is quite a hindrance and can get extremely frustrating as the game proceeds.

[h1]Visuals: 9/10[/h1]
Graphics. A thing that is rarely the priority of games of this genre. Usually the game is more heavily focused on the gameplay or the story than the graphics, so you never really end up with a crisp or pristine experience. Graphics however in Sekiro seemed to be a very prominent part of its development. Much akin to Dark Souls 3, this game is beautiful to say the least. The world has an enormous attention to detail and you can tell from the very first moments you begin playing. I didn't experience any graphical issues, such as tearing or glitches. However i would like to mention that in some areas the frame rates ever so rarely do tend to take a dip. All settings were set to max and as a whole the experience was sensational.

[h1]Audio: 9/10[/h1]
It's been a very long time since i sat here in my gaming chair, closed my eyes and just enjoyed the ambient sound and music of a game, until i played Sekiro. The world is extremely alive, even to the very fabric of the game world, Water rushes past, the sound of leaves rustling heavily in the trees above and around you, The clang of weapons colliding as you make the perfect deflect. The voice acting here is sensational and done with extreme care. This is a true experience for the senses,

[h1]Overall: 9/10[/h1]
I know that the Soulsborne games aren't for everyone, and that it's frustrating challenges and difficulty can be completely off putting for some gamers out there. I will say that this game is not for everyone, It may not even be for the most avid Soulsborne fan in existence with how dynamically it has changed in formula. It is however a sensational experience that hit me right in the feels. I rarely get emotional towards the end of a gaming experience but here i did, because i knew my journey was ending, I sat in the final area after finishing the story for about 30mins and just gazed upon the beauty the developers had created and reminisced on the time played. This isn't just a game, its an experience, and whether the Soulsborne franchise is or isn't your cup of tea, i think this game should be a must play for fans of story, of progression and of challenge. This is definite positive review, and i hope many gamers have loved this, and i hope that many more will come to enjoy it in time.

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"You don't need to know my opinion of the game at this point - this is one of the most frequently reviewed and discussed (singleplayer) games of 2019.

Personally, though, I've enjoyed Sekiro more than Dark Souls or Bloodborne, trading away community/multiplayer elements and varied RPG minutiae for a more cohesive set of mechanics focused tightly on reading enemy body language, choosing and timing your responses - then throwing in a dash of stealth and a selection of useful but diverse ""subweapons"" in the form of Prosthetic Tools.

It feels largely more focused than some of From Software's other games, both having an extremely tight mechanic set that isn't weighted overly towards one playstyle (or method of combat) than another, and with more clear goals inherent in both in the narrative and general level design."

Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,can write death in japanese now
Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition,Adventure,814380,"When I first got the game, I liked it.  Then I met the first mini-boss and died a lot.  I got better.  Watched quite a few walk-throughs and tips videos.  I hated everything about it.  The I-frames, the enemy fight timings, the death mechanics, the Ogre...oh! that damnable, stinking ogre!  I never hated a character more until I had to fight Lady Butterfly.  Then about 20 hours in, I just got it.  I understood.  Then I was able to appreciate the landscapes, the quests, and the story line. I got my platinum in about 43 hours.  I've played through about 38 times, conquered all DLC gauntlets, and still love playing it.  I can now do a full run through in about 10 hours if I play all the side quests and kill all there is to kill.  Still hate the Headless though.  1007 hours and still love it.  I probably can't play anything else that From Software has now, but that is okay.  I'll still give the Souls series a try at some point.  Looking forward to Elden Ring."

Once you have every upgrade/combat art its like a different game. The boss fights are all difficult in their own way and extremely satisfying to defeat, even after multiple play throughs. The guantlets are interesting boss rushes to do once the story has been completed, with the last boss being a tuned up version of the old boss with new move sets, grinding out these have been frustrating and enjoyable, clearing the Shura guantlet was the best experience i've had in this game.

Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"For a long time I've been hearing from other people ""PLAY TITANFALL 2"", and I was all ""Well I don't want to install a whole other digital store just to play one thing"" and they'd respond with ""PLAY TITANFALL 2"". The game got released on Steam and having played it myself I will now join the chorus of people yelling in all caps ""PLAY TITANFALL 2""

Normally I wouldn't be into a shooter like this with such a quick time to death, but the movement adds fun new layers of tech to the shooter formula that's been dominated by the CoD franchise to make Titanfall stand out. Wall running lets the player reach speed that cannot be reached by regular running around. The double jump and climbing allows the maps to have lots of verticality and gives the player multiple options to get to where they want to go. When running the crouch becomes a slide, letting the player swooce into cover if getting shot at, allowing them to zip under small gaps, and turning melee attacks into uppercuts.

Weapon wise there's a lot to work with, all the staples are here and there should be something for everyone. Shotguns, SMGs, rifles, machine guns, energy weapons, even stuff that shoots projectiles you need to lead instead of the hitscan weapons that you'd expect. Multiple grenade types as well, so there's plenty of things to mess around with until you mix and match your way to finding exactly what works best for you. Personally I'm a fan of the energy machine gun that makes people explode like hotdogs in a microwave and the thermite ninja stars.

Then we get to the titans themselves. In multiplayer you build your way towards earning one (in the modes where there are titans) by fighting, and they're pretty good rewards for doing so. They completely change how you play, you can kill players outside of titans just by stepping on them, the UI changes, you lose options for movement and are too big to get into smaller spaces, but you get new tricks in return. Each titan model has different guns, different skills, and a different super move that they can do if they live long enough to earn it, and a different look (that you can customize further with skins and nose art and stuff), so each one is pretty unique. Though titans are harder to kill than regular pilots, pilots have their own stuff to even the odds as well: anti-titan secondary weapons such as RPGs or laser cannons, and you can jump on enemy titans to steal batteries and deal damage, and jump on friendly titans to prevent the same thing from happening to your team, and to give batteries you stole.

Multiplayer is still active, despite the games age, I never had to wait too long to get into a match, and there's plenty of different mods to mess around with. While there are max level ""John Titanfall"" players who've been around since the game was originally released I never ran into too many, so that wasn't that big of a deal for me. The community isn't that bad, there's some shit talking but I never ran into ""XBOX live lobby"" levels of pre-teen screeching.

I did have to install some version of Origin to gets this going which I didn't like, but I don't think this was going to come to Steam otherwise.

The singleplayer campaign is great, lots of cool set pieces, lots of chances to screw around with the wall running, would recommend even if you don't want to touch multiplayer.

Visually the game is pretty stellar, they squeeze a lot out the Source engine.

TitanFall 2 is pretty great, I wish Titanfall 3 was a thing, booooo Apex Legends boooo you can't wall run BOOOOOOOOO. I give Titanfall 2 a ""PLAY TITANFALL 2"" out of ten."

Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,really really good movement. you can run around like spiderman with a shotgun!
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"I love this game. I have completed the campaign and am a generation 3 in the multiplayer. this game has given me 72 hour and more of fun. I would really recomend this game. 
notes: campaign almost made me cry
the movement is really smooth
The multiplayer is fun but the ques are sometimes long"
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"My very honest review. Do I love this game? I did. Do I enjoy playing the game anymore? Not really.

Titanfall 2, game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by EA was probably the best FPS game I have played in my life. It's a quick paced shooter with all the actions and variety weapons and skills to try out for different game styles. Although all these unique perks and weapons exist, the one that really stands out on the spot is the movement features. Wall runs, double jumps, grappling hook, adrenaline, bunny hops, and slide runs. Being able to fly around the map feels amazing, you know the kind of feeling you get when you watch the scene from the movie ""Matrix"". It has such an amazing concept for a video game.

So what made me dislike the game? Hit detection and server issues. You see, if you are a part of the Titanfall community you know about the downfall of Titanfall 1. The horrible server issues make the game unplayable and even make the hit detection absolutely horrible. As usual, I'm not skilled at playing games but that won't excuse the disabilities the game is receiving. What I'm saying is, it's an outdated game that the developers did not give enough attention to. Today I finally snapped and built a massive frustration inside me. You could be asking, ""Maybe it's your internet?"" Please, I think having a 1GB internet from Korea is enough for me. When I connect to multiplayer, the game notifies me that I will be having 32 ms ping in Tokyo servers but when I'm put into a match, I have over 150 ping. The game is currently unplayable.

Anyways pros and cons,

Pros :
- Absolutely stunning gameplay mechanics
- The freedom of movement you can barely see in other games
- Decently optimised
- Loved the campaign
- Variety of perks, variety of weapons

Cons :
- DDos
- Server issues (especially in Asia)
- Hit registration/hit detection
- Cheaters in Hong Kong and Taiwan servers
- Resolution issues
- Quitting may sometimes leave a black screen
- Melee mechanics
- Requires third-party software, ORIGIN

I really really do love this game. I would even have considered it as my favourite FPS game. But from it's current state? It's a waste of penny because you cannot play the game. You just cannot and if you get targeted by the DDoSer, you will never be able to play the game anymore. It might be outdated but I hope the devs would look into the situation and give more attention to this game.

P.S. Don't buy it."
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,its like crack for people who haven't taken crack

Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,This game awesome
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"[b]CONDITIONAL RECO[/b]

As the news says  this games multiplayer component is where this game shines. Unfortunately Respawn and EA see fit to ignore their growing and avid playerbase and not improve or harden the match making from scumsucking hackers who destroy it in every way possible. they knowingly sell a broken and unplayable product. Currently, do not buy because the multiplayer is FUCKED. If the DDOS issue is fixed i will change this review but I sincerely doubt it with EA and Respawns current Track record with fixing games that are not the current social circle jerk or their garbage shilled sports games.

[b]BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK PILOT[/b]"
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,Help i am being chased down by a monarch for my AA batteries great game.
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,Very good and well designed campaign
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"A rather simple story, yet emotionally impactful and an iconic duo may I add. The gameplay is plain legendary and easy to get into but hard to master, the combinations with the abilities and the weapons along with it give you the impression that you're a badass even when you don't exactly know what you're doing. Each mission feels unique and has it's own little twist that makes them all a blast to play. The multiplayer I played only for the achievement so I don't have an actual say in that but the 2 matches I played were pretty good and overall balanced. The achievements were fair and I got to say it's one of the most COMPLETE games I've ever played, that left me satisfied from the start until the end."
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,This game is a masterpiece
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"This probably is my favourite game in a while since the first time I played The Last Of Us.

-Campaign-
Story: 9/10
love the link between BT and Cooper, Throughout the game the duo improve their trust and they show it in some examples such as at the beginning of the game BT calls you Pilot but throughout the game you go through more and more BT calls you by Cooper, In fact the whole story between the two is all about trust with BT in some sections saying ""Trust me"", It's also cool seeing other pilots in the story such as the 6-4 and some old characters from the old game and the multiplayer such as Sarah Briggs and other characters. It's a 9/10 because I wished they fleshed out more of the story and give us a sequel.

Mechanics: 9/10
Minor spoilers for one of the missions in the single-player but you arrive at the location of a fallen militia pilot named Anderson and obtain a time-travel device found on his corpse. Probably the most memorable mission I've ever played since it's so unique. 

For the Multi-player side of the game there is a lot more diversity, I personally use the grapple hook since it's the one utility that requires practice and it's so much fun finding the tallest structure in the map to use it as a slingshot target. It's so much fun since you require the the camera to change the direction, pitch and yaw of your movement. 
There are other utilities such as Cloak, Pulse Blade, Phase shift, A-wall and Stim.
All are great but they only can be used for players who like to use them to their full potential.
I'll leave a short explanation of each of them.

Cloak - Used by Cooper in the single-player, Creates a cloak for pilots that makes them barely visible but not to the point where other pilots can't see you

Stim - Gives the pilot an injection of speed which can be used for wall running, the more speed you obtain the more the stim will multiply your velocity. Also brings the perk of healing the user.

Hollow Pilot - Creates advanced clones of the pilot that follow the last thing the user was doing such as sprinting, walking, crouching and sliding.

A-wall - Portable shield for the user that blocks bullets coming towards it but the user can shoot through the shield, similar to the particle shield on the Tone titan

Pulse Blade - A dagger that is throwable and creates a radius near the blade that shows Titans, Attrition and Pilots on the map and gives them a silhouette on the user's screen (Enemy players can see that they are being detected by a pulse blade) 

Phase shift - Similar to cloak but slightly different, When the user uses the shift power they can teleport to an alternate dimension that shows the map in a darker look. Users that phase shift at the same time can see each other but cannot interact until they leave the phase shift dimension.

All of these abilities/ utilities are great but I haven't used them too much.

A bit of background of me
I started playing Titanfall 2 during the Tech Test since I was kinda dried out from playing non-stop Grand Theft Auto V on PS4. I heard Titanfall 2 was coming to PlayStation and I remember the title name from older Vanoss Gaming video. In the few days I had to play I enjoyed playing the multiplayer of Titanfall 2 and how the gunplay works with all the different abilities. Fast forward a few months to the release, I forgot about the date the game was going to be released since there wasn't to much advertising since the game was launching inbetween Call of Duty Infinite Warfare and Battlefield 1, I have to agree with the community with how EA just threw this title aside since they didn't want to distract everyone with one of their biggest titles.
I wish there were more advertising towards the game. I managed to pick up the game maybe a month after the release and I've enjoyed it since.

I moved to PC since I didn't wanna pay for PS+ any longer and the grapple hook works better with a mouse."

Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"I love this game. I have completed the campaign and am a generation 3 in the multiplayer. this game has given me 72 hour and more of fun. I would really recomend this game. 
notes: campaign almost made me cry
the movement is really smooth
The multiplayer is fun but the ques are sometimes long"
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,its like crack for people who haven't taken crack
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"The god-king above all. As the rest stumble and flounder over each other in the mud, struggling for a crown made of dung and sticks all while proclaiming themselves number 1 in their unbridled ignorance. 
Their ignorance is born from Titanfall 2 sitting so high atop the mountain the they cannot see it's majesty."
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,This game awesome
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"[b]CONDITIONAL RECO[/b]

As the news says  this games multiplayer component is where this game shines. Unfortunately Respawn and EA see fit to ignore their growing and avid playerbase and not improve or harden the match making from scumsucking hackers who destroy it in every way possible. they knowingly sell a broken and unplayable product. Currently, do not buy because the multiplayer is FUCKED. If the DDOS issue is fixed i will change this review but I sincerely doubt it with EA and Respawns current Track record with fixing games that are not the current social circle jerk or their garbage shilled sports games.

[b]BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK PILOT[/b]"
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"My very honest review. Do I love this game? I did. Do I enjoy playing the game anymore? Not really.

Titanfall 2, game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by EA was probably the best FPS game I have played in my life. It's a quick paced shooter with all the actions and variety weapons and skills to try out for different game styles. Although all these unique perks and weapons exist, the one that really stands out on the spot is the movement features. Wall runs, double jumps, grappling hook, adrenaline, bunny hops, and slide runs. Being able to fly around the map feels amazing, you know the kind of feeling you get when you watch the scene from the movie ""Matrix"". It has such an amazing concept for a video game.

So what made me dislike the game? Hit detection and server issues. You see, if you are a part of the Titanfall community you know about the downfall of Titanfall 1. The horrible server issues make the game unplayable and even make the hit detection absolutely horrible. As usual, I'm not skilled at playing games but that won't excuse the disabilities the game is receiving. What I'm saying is, it's an outdated game that the developers did not give enough attention to. Today I finally snapped and built a massive frustration inside me. You could be asking, ""Maybe it's your internet?"" Please, I think having a 1GB internet from Korea is enough for me. When I connect to multiplayer, the game notifies me that I will be having 32 ms ping in Tokyo servers but when I'm put into a match, I have over 150 ping. The game is currently unplayable.

Anyways pros and cons,

Pros :
- Absolutely stunning gameplay mechanics
- The freedom of movement you can barely see in other games
- Decently optimised
- Loved the campaign
- Variety of perks, variety of weapons

Cons :
- DDos
- Server issues (especially in Asia)
- Hit registration/hit detection
- Cheaters in Hong Kong and Taiwan servers
- Resolution issues
- Quitting may sometimes leave a black screen
- Melee mechanics
- Requires third-party software, ORIGIN

I really really do love this game. I would even have considered it as my favourite FPS game. But from it's current state? It's a waste of penny because you cannot play the game. You just cannot and if you get targeted by the DDoSer, you will never be able to play the game anymore. It might be outdated but I hope the devs would look into the situation and give more attention to this game.

P.S. Don't buy it."
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,BRO YOU NEED TO TRY THE CAMPAIGN IT IS AMAZING AND THE END IS JUST- JUST PLAY IT
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,HAHA TITAN GO SMASH
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,play it
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,Help i am being chased down by a monarch for my AA batteries great game.
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,Very good and well designed campaign
Titanfall® 2,Action,1237970,"A rather simple story, yet emotionally impactful and an iconic duo may I add. The gameplay is plain legendary and easy to get into but hard to master, the combinations with the abilities and the weapons along with it give you the impression that you're a badass even when you don't exactly know what you're doing. Each mission feels unique and has it's own little twist that makes them all a blast to play. The multiplayer I played only for the achievement so I don't have an actual say in that but the 2 matches I played were pretty good and overall balanced. The achievements were fair and I got to say it's one of the most COMPLETE games I've ever played, that left me satisfied from the start until the end."

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"You wake in a tavern, replenish your ship's supplies (food, wood, cannon balls) and customize it's cosmetics.
You talk with an NPC who gives you a quest. You receive a map of an island with red crosses on it.
You go to your ship and search for that island on the world map. You find it, and figure out which way to sail.
You unfurl your sails and turn the helm towards the destination.

A few minutes pass. While you're in the middle of the ocean, trying to navigate around a storm, the water suddenly turns black. Combat music kicks in, as a pair of tentacles emerge from the depths.
A wild Kraken appears, and it thinks that your ship is tasty.
You grab a handful of cannonballs from storage and man the cannons.
With a few well placed shots and a couple shredded tentacles, the Kraken leaves you alone.
You repair the damage to your ship, and jump in the water to pick up the Kraken's meat.
Looking at the map, a short detour towards a trading post is possible.
You place the meat on a skillet to cook, while you turn your ship towards the merchants.
After selling the Kraken meat, you set sail towards your quest.
The rest of the voyage is uneventful, and you reach the island and drop the anchor.
With map in one hand and a shovel in another, you set foot on the tropical island before you.
With no minimap, you need to read the map and orient yourself based on landmarks you see.
Eventually you find one of the places where the treasure should be.
Enthusiastically, you swing your shovel in to the sand and hit wood!

You've found a wooden chest, that is one of the treasures on the island.
However, you also found a pack of animated skeletons who would rather you not take the treasure.
You draw your sword and fight the bones.
You notice a lone skeleton carry a big red barrel of gunpowder toward you. Without skipping a beat, you run a few paces away and draw your pistol.
With a single shot, you hit the barrel which promptly explodes, obliterating the nearby skeletons.
One of which drops a piece of parchment.
On the parchment there is a quest...

Sea of Thieves is a well polished multiplayer-only title about adventure. There's plenty of stuff to do, and the game always finds more activities to offer you.
The only downside is that it requires a crew to be viable in PVP (which can't be turned off), and to be effective the crew needs to communicate well. It can be hard to find such crew, so it's best played with friends you know in advance."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"I'm a 46 year old dad and I absolutely love playing this with my 13 year old son.  Don't get caught up over losing loot to a raider or reaper, it's just part of the game.  Let your kid set the quest, or decide to attack a fort, or a tornado and just have fun being pirates for an evening.  I take the helm and keep us on course, he works the cannons and is an excellent shot.

An awesome game to bond over, and a great way to talk about how to not be a jerk online, how to deal with disappointment, how to work as a team when you make alliances, and how to be a gracious winner.  He loves to help new players, will upend a planned evening to help some newbie finish a tall tale.  Great game to play with your kids."

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"After several hours you finally have a big laod of chests onboard, then suddenly a kraken attacks your ship! after a tedious battle you manage to escape, only to be attacked by other players. Then after a lengthy battle of wit you find yourself on a island where you can sell all your precious loot! Then, do it all again with new random encounters.

Sea of thieves is a first=person pirate adventure game where you can do whatever you like. The game looks goofy but the water looks amazing. The gameplay is very varied and it is lots of fun with other people to play. I definitiely reccommend this game."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"I am really unsure whether I should recommend this game or not. 

Pro:
-Awesome piratey atmosphere
-Sailing is a lot of fun, especially with friends, but also single
-Cool stories and exploration is fun

Con:
-Toxic Community
-You're killed on sight, no matter if you have loot, are friendly or mind your own business, then made fun of
-There are no PVE servers, not even safezones
-No Roleplay except with your friends

Me and my friends lost interest in this game fairly quickly. We wanted to enjoy the game, not constantly participate in some waterbased pvp-arena, in which one is forced to compete because of nonexisting pve-guidelines, therefore the perfect hunting grounds for toxic-pvp players. While merely learning the basics, we have been killed countless times and had to learn many things from youtube, because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to play the game at all. 

@developers: I understand, that it's an important aspect in a pirate game to be able to freely murder and pillage, but why are there no safezones, at least where the traders are (almost every multiplayerbased game with pvp-elements has those or npc-guarded zones)? Please reconsider including more pve-friendly mechanics, maybe a pirates codex with rules, which are not optional to a certain degree or maybe an npc-based menace like the royal navy, where playergroups can join in a pirate alliance to take on npc-vessels. The game has a lot of potencial, sadly not so much for atmosphere-loving pve players. For now I therefore give this game no recommendation, because in the current state im not motivated to play it any further."

What a shame the report system doesn't actually work. Very disappointing."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"[h1]Gentlemen, my lady... You will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow![/h1]"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,If you love anything pirates you should buy this game. The new pirates life tall tale is worth the full price alone.
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"This is a game I play with friends when they want to play it themselves, but I'd never EVER set foot in it of my own volition. In its current state, it's a game that lives and breathes toxicity while also looking visually pretty and having an interesting gameplay loop.

There is basically zero depth in the progression system because all you have to use as a pirate is the small set of weapons you are given, and as you play more you receive nothing new except for cosmetics and titles. As it is a live service game, the nice cosmetics are all locked in the microtransaction store, but whatever. That's nowhere near the biggest problem with this game.

PVE is a slog, since you're spending literal hours sailing to faraway locations for fetch quests, and bosses in high-tier activities take way too long to kill. It also doesn't help pacing when you see that some bosses (if not all; I haven't encountered every single one), if not kept constantly under attack, will heal themselves at any chance they get. It's incredibly annoying. Nothing has a health bar.

To add insult to injury, PVP is a hugely toxic mess that plagues this game like a nasty group of piranhas. Nobody puts any thought into killing anyone, they just do it; regardless of whether their target has loot or their ship is freshly spawned. See a sloop in the distance? It's probably already on its way over to you and you'll be sunk in a few minutes. All that loot you spent hours gathering that you're taking to an outpost to sell? It's all undone in a heartbeat if another group of players wants it. This is the pain point that toxic players (pretty much all of the vocal playerbase) will crucify you for if you bring it up at all.

Even worse is that players trying to do story missions (""tall tales"") will be sunk without warning by PVP players. The tall tales that Rare has made available are great fun, and would do well to have their own separate mode away from the toxicity of PVP, but Rare has apparently already firmly made their stance that this will never, ever happen. It's really a toss-up if you're going to get followed by a nasty couple of pirates for your entire session, or if you'll be lucky enough to be left alone for most of it. Again, any time the topic of ""why isn't there instanced tall tales, PVP is ruining this game for me"" is brought up in discussion boards, it will get shot down by absolutely anyone for reasons such as ""balance,"" ""get good,"" and other such annoyances.

When my friends decide to give this game a chance and we really get into a story mission that we enjoy and get sunk twice by the same sloop, completely unprovoked, and then they never want to play the game again, it becomes a textbook example of a badly designed multiplayer game with a tone-deaf development team.

I'll also mention (because this irks me a lot, and I know it's minor) the fact that this is a game that's also released on PC, not just Xbox, and the FOV slider is locked to a maximum of 90 (which is sickening and much better suited to couch gameplay). Luckily, the Steam community found a way to bypass this lock and open the FOV up to a more comfortable level through a config edit. For whatever reason, Rare thought this would give players an unfair advantage (how?), and with the Pirate's Life patch they disabled this fix outright, even boasting about it in the changelog. To spit in the face of a playerbase that is so comfortable with higher FOVs for the sake of ""balance"" in a game that doesn't require competitive integrity whatsoever is just gross.

I guess the toxicity really gets lost in an amalgamation of this game's effort to keep to its theme, like how it has almost no persistent UI elements except for your health bar, and the writing is tastefully mixed in rhymes. Because the playerbase is about as toxic as real pirates would be. It's kind of hilarious.

The only way to have fun in this game is to find players at sea who are new to it, and help them have a good time; because nice players is what this game sorely lacks."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"I think it's good. I kind of enjoy the grind, but it certainly is NOT for everyone, especially for those who get angry at losing progress. Go into this game with the expectation that you WILL have to defend your booty with your life, as there are plenty of players who are more than willing to take it from you. For example, I recently had a ship sink ours after a difficult Kraken fight, who watched us struggle against the kraken before picking up the leftovers. We lost all our loot, which wasn't much - but enough to make us have to start our long main story quest from the beginning. Sure, sometimes you can play nice with other strangers, but I've seen more hostile interactions then friendly. This game is called Sea of [i]Thieves[/i], after all."

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,a pirate called me a homophobic slur and sunk my ship                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       10/10
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"You wake in a tavern, replenish your ship's supplies (food, wood, cannon balls) and customize it's cosmetics.
You talk with an NPC who gives you a quest. You receive a map of an island with red crosses on it.
You go to your ship and search for that island on the world map. You find it, and figure out which way to sail.
You unfurl your sails and turn the helm towards the destination.

A few minutes pass. While you're in the middle of the ocean, trying to navigate around a storm, the water suddenly turns black. Combat music kicks in, as a pair of tentacles emerge from the depths.
A wild Kraken appears, and it thinks that your ship is tasty.
You grab a handful of cannonballs from storage and man the cannons.
With a few well placed shots and a couple shredded tentacles, the Kraken leaves you alone.
You repair the damage to your ship, and jump in the water to pick up the Kraken's meat.
Looking at the map, a short detour towards a trading post is possible.
You place the meat on a skillet to cook, while you turn your ship towards the merchants.
After selling the Kraken meat, you set sail towards your quest.
The rest of the voyage is uneventful, and you reach the island and drop the anchor.
With map in one hand and a shovel in another, you set foot on the tropical island before you.
With no minimap, you need to read the map and orient yourself based on landmarks you see.
Eventually you find one of the places where the treasure should be.
Enthusiastically, you swing your shovel in to the sand and hit wood!

You've found a wooden chest, that is one of the treasures on the island.
However, you also found a pack of animated skeletons who would rather you not take the treasure.
You draw your sword and fight the bones.
You notice a lone skeleton carry a big red barrel of gunpowder toward you. Without skipping a beat, you run a few paces away and draw your pistol.
With a single shot, you hit the barrel which promptly explodes, obliterating the nearby skeletons.
One of which drops a piece of parchment.
On the parchment there is a quest...

Sea of Thieves is a well polished multiplayer-only title about adventure. There's plenty of stuff to do, and the game always finds more activities to offer you.
The only downside is that it requires a crew to be viable in PVP (which can't be turned off), and to be effective the crew needs to communicate well. It can be hard to find such crew, so it's best played with friends you know in advance."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"I'm a 46 year old dad and I absolutely love playing this with my 13 year old son.  Don't get caught up over losing loot to a raider or reaper, it's just part of the game.  Let your kid set the quest, or decide to attack a fort, or a tornado and just have fun being pirates for an evening.  I take the helm and keep us on course, he works the cannons and is an excellent shot.

An awesome game to bond over, and a great way to talk about how to not be a jerk online, how to deal with disappointment, how to work as a team when you make alliances, and how to be a gracious winner.  He loves to help new players, will upend a planned evening to help some newbie finish a tall tale.  Great game to play with your kids."

Turned this game from something little (2018) to what I can call one of the best experiences I had with a game right now and hopefully more soon.

Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"After several hours you finally have a big laod of chests onboard, then suddenly a kraken attacks your ship! after a tedious battle you manage to escape, only to be attacked by other players. Then after a lengthy battle of wit you find yourself on a island where you can sell all your precious loot! Then, do it all again with new random encounters.

Sea of thieves is a first=person pirate adventure game where you can do whatever you like. The game looks goofy but the water looks amazing. The gameplay is very varied and it is lots of fun with other people to play. I definitiely reccommend this game."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"I am really unsure whether I should recommend this game or not. 

Pro:
-Awesome piratey atmosphere
-Sailing is a lot of fun, especially with friends, but also single
-Cool stories and exploration is fun

Con:
-Toxic Community
-You're killed on sight, no matter if you have loot, are friendly or mind your own business, then made fun of
-There are no PVE servers, not even safezones
-No Roleplay except with your friends

Me and my friends lost interest in this game fairly quickly. We wanted to enjoy the game, not constantly participate in some waterbased pvp-arena, in which one is forced to compete because of nonexisting pve-guidelines, therefore the perfect hunting grounds for toxic-pvp players. While merely learning the basics, we have been killed countless times and had to learn many things from youtube, because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to play the game at all. 

@developers: I understand, that it's an important aspect in a pirate game to be able to freely murder and pillage, but why are there no safezones, at least where the traders are (almost every multiplayerbased game with pvp-elements has those or npc-guarded zones)? Please reconsider including more pve-friendly mechanics, maybe a pirates codex with rules, which are not optional to a certain degree or maybe an npc-based menace like the royal navy, where playergroups can join in a pirate alliance to take on npc-vessels. The game has a lot of potencial, sadly not so much for atmosphere-loving pve players. For now I therefore give this game no recommendation, because in the current state im not motivated to play it any further."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,Good and Fun game reminds me of Black Flag
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,removed 120FOV xbox players crying even tho it gave 0 advantage. the devs dont care about PVP
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"Very good game, but the community really sucks ass. We ran into another player called RealCoolGuy123 and he just spawn camped our ship and killed everyone on the server and teleported around while hacking. What a shame the report system doesn't actually work. Very disappointing."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"[h1]Gentlemen, my lady... You will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow![/h1]"
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,If you love anything pirates you should buy this game. The new pirates life tall tale is worth the full price alone.
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"This is a game I play with friends when they want to play it themselves, but I'd never EVER set foot in it of my own volition. In its current state, it's a game that lives and breathes toxicity while also looking visually pretty and having an interesting gameplay loop.

There is basically zero depth in the progression system because all you have to use as a pirate is the small set of weapons you are given, and as you play more you receive nothing new except for cosmetics and titles. As it is a live service game, the nice cosmetics are all locked in the microtransaction store, but whatever. That's nowhere near the biggest problem with this game.

PVE is a slog, since you're spending literal hours sailing to faraway locations for fetch quests, and bosses in high-tier activities take way too long to kill. It also doesn't help pacing when you see that some bosses (if not all; I haven't encountered every single one), if not kept constantly under attack, will heal themselves at any chance they get. It's incredibly annoying. Nothing has a health bar.

To add insult to injury, PVP is a hugely toxic mess that plagues this game like a nasty group of piranhas. Nobody puts any thought into killing anyone, they just do it; regardless of whether their target has loot or their ship is freshly spawned. See a sloop in the distance? It's probably already on its way over to you and you'll be sunk in a few minutes. All that loot you spent hours gathering that you're taking to an outpost to sell? It's all undone in a heartbeat if another group of players wants it. This is the pain point that toxic players (pretty much all of the vocal playerbase) will crucify you for if you bring it up at all.

Even worse is that players trying to do story missions (""tall tales"") will be sunk without warning by PVP players. The tall tales that Rare has made available are great fun, and would do well to have their own separate mode away from the toxicity of PVP, but Rare has apparently already firmly made their stance that this will never, ever happen. It's really a toss-up if you're going to get followed by a nasty couple of pirates for your entire session, or if you'll be lucky enough to be left alone for most of it. Again, any time the topic of ""why isn't there instanced tall tales, PVP is ruining this game for me"" is brought up in discussion boards, it will get shot down by absolutely anyone for reasons such as ""balance,"" ""get good,"" and other such annoyances.

When my friends decide to give this game a chance and we really get into a story mission that we enjoy and get sunk twice by the same sloop, completely unprovoked, and then they never want to play the game again, it becomes a textbook example of a badly designed multiplayer game with a tone-deaf development team.

I'll also mention (because this irks me a lot, and I know it's minor) the fact that this is a game that's also released on PC, not just Xbox, and the FOV slider is locked to a maximum of 90 (which is sickening and much better suited to couch gameplay). Luckily, the Steam community found a way to bypass this lock and open the FOV up to a more comfortable level through a config edit. For whatever reason, Rare thought this would give players an unfair advantage (how?), and with the Pirate's Life patch they disabled this fix outright, even boasting about it in the changelog. To spit in the face of a playerbase that is so comfortable with higher FOVs for the sake of ""balance"" in a game that doesn't require competitive integrity whatsoever is just gross.

I guess the toxicity really gets lost in an amalgamation of this game's effort to keep to its theme, like how it has almost no persistent UI elements except for your health bar, and the writing is tastefully mixed in rhymes. Because the playerbase is about as toxic as real pirates would be. It's kind of hilarious.

The only way to have fun in this game is to find players at sea who are new to it, and help them have a good time; because nice players is what this game sorely lacks."
Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"I think it's good. I kind of enjoy the grind, but it certainly is NOT for everyone, especially for those who get angry at losing progress. Go into this game with the expectation that you WILL have to defend your booty with your life, as there are plenty of players who are more than willing to take it from you. For example, I recently had a ship sink ours after a difficult Kraken fight, who watched us struggle against the kraken before picking up the leftovers. We lost all our loot, which wasn't much - but enough to make us have to start our long main story quest from the beginning. Sure, sometimes you can play nice with other strangers, but I've seen more hostile interactions then friendly. This game is called Sea of [i]Thieves[/i], after all."

this is one of the best game i've played so far in terms of graphics (highly recommend you guys to maxed out your settings). aside from that, the gameplay is pretty amazing too it's quite long so i recommend for those who are looking for an adventure game because this game is an absolute steal.

Not many issues, did have some framedrops on my laptop (rtx 2070, 9750h, 32 gb 2666 ram), it was a rare occurence in an otherwise polished game. Would highly recommend especially during sales. 

One thing I really love is Xen, it is completely redone and nothing like the xen in half life. A full world and fully realised. Awesome visuals and puzzels.

Black Mesa,Action,362890,"This felt like playing Half life 1 again for the very first time. Brilliant remake that changes the game to how you think you remember it while expanding a lot of areas and fixing some issues with level design. Even familiar set pieces and locations were changed so it feels fresh and exciting to reach them. 

The big highlight of this remake is the complete overhaul of Xen. It has been completely redesigned to the point its nearly unrecognisable from the original game. Xen is one of the best looking areas i have seen in a game. My only real issue with it is Interloper. Its still bad but for a different reason. Its too drawn out and gets extremely repetitive especially towards the end and i wish they had made it a bit shorter instead."
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"Always a Halflife fan, since back in the day. Great redo of the game."
Black Mesa,Action,362890,The start is a little slow and exactly like the first game which is great but the real Gem is the alien world which is completely different and a real treat to explore - really worth doing the first part.
Black Mesa,Action,362890,"[i]Black Mesa[/i] is perhaps the only competent remastering of the classic [i]Half-Life[/i], bringing a well-deserving game to future generations.

With this game, I wasn't exactly sure how to feel about it, as it is a very unique project from the outset. A different developer entirely was working on the remaster of a decades old game and [i]Valve[/i] gave them the go ahead to release it with their support. Personally, I had a lot of qualms with the previous remaster of this title, [i]Half-Life: Source[/i], because in remastering it, the game lost some of its stylistic nature and it overall did not do enough to warrant purchasing the game with so little really done to enhance the experience. With ""Black Mesa"" on the other hand, it is a definite graphical upgrade, making the game appear as though it was on par graphically to the sequel, [i]Half-Life 2[/i]. If one were to pick the original up today, the subpar visuals and dated limitations would scare plenty of possible players away, but with such a competent re-release done by developers who clearly cared about transporting the original's experience to the modern day, it is apparent the job was well done.

After finishing this game, I will admit I did hold a bit of an issue with it within myself. You see, for 80% of the game, the contents of [i]Black Mesa[/i] are identical to [i]Half-Life[/i], but after the player makes their way to the [i]Xen[/i] chapter and onward, they are met with an artistic redesign of a majority of the alien home world. Now, graphically, it is stunning and clearly what a fair amount of the budget went towards getting right. Depending on your initial thoughts of the late game from the original, you may have welcomed this change with open arms, but personally and thematically, it feels off to say the least. Sure, the details like introducing slave-driving into the alien society would have been fitting for the sequel, but for this game it felt out of place because that was not the thematic focus of this title and therefore it feels like it is trying to amend the lack of hindsight for [i]Half-Life 2's[/i] ambitions by implementing these half-heartedly to fit the overarching narrative of the series, but as I said, it just falls flat when sat down next to the rest of the game. I would argue that though these redone sections of [i]Xen[/i] are more thought out than those of the original game, they stretch the game out and the pacing ultimately suffers for it.

Would I take [i]Black Mesa[/i] over [i]Half-Life[/i]? Well, it really depends on my mood and if I want to take advantage of the improvements and added mechanics of this remaster or just want to go back and relish the classic. I would have to say that I still believe the original to be the better release overall, and really, I would probably say that for most originals over their remakes unless they take the style into account throughout the transition and have objectively better enhancements that make the previous entry pale in comparison. Though I had fun with my time in [i]Black Mesa[/i], I am not adverse to going back and playing older releases even if it means I have to deal with dated features, therefore [i]Half-Life[/i] is undoubtedly the game I prefer to go back to. If you are unable to deal with dated functionality, however, than this game cuts out all of the slack and gives you a modernized and close enough replication of the taste the original has to offer.

After finishing this game, I will admit I did hold a bit of an issue with it within myself. You see, for 80% of the game, the contents of [i]Black Mesa[/i] are identical to [i]Half-Life[/i], but after the player makes their way to the [i]Xen[/i] chapter and onward, they are met with an artistic redesign of a majority of the alien home world. Now, graphically, it is stunning and clearly what a fair amount of the budget went towards getting right. Depending on your initial thoughts of the late game from the original, you may have welcomed this change with open arms, but personally and thematically, it feels off to say the least. Sure, the details like introducing slave-driving into the alien society would have been fitting for the sequel, but for this game it felt out of place because that was not the thematic focus of this title and therefore it feels like it is trying to amend the lack of hindsight for [i]Half-Life 2's[/i] ambitions by implementing these half-heartedly to fit the overarching narrative of the series, but as I said, it just falls flat when sat down next to the rest of the game. I would argue that though these redone sections of [i]Xen[/i] are more thought out than those of the original game, they stretch the game out and the pacing ultimately suffers for it.

Would I take [i]Black Mesa[/i] over [i]Half-Life[/i]? Well, it really depends on my mood and if I want to take advantage of the improvements and added mechanics of this remaster or just want to go back and relish the classic. I would have to say that I still believe the original to be the better release overall, and really, I would probably say that for most originals over their remakes unless they take the style into account throughout the transition and have objectively better enhancements that make the previous entry pale in comparison. Though I had fun with my time in [i]Black Mesa[/i], I am not adverse to going back and playing older releases even if it means I have to deal with dated features, therefore [i]Half-Life[/i] is undoubtedly the game I prefer to go back to. If you are unable to deal with dated functionality, however, than this game cuts out all of the slack and gives you a modernized and close enough replication of the taste the original has to offer.

Instead, i'll share the fact that I have 1001 hours logged on this game at the time of writing this review. So I like it at least 1001 hours' worth. In closing: play this game, it is good. Thank you for your time."
Terraria,Adventure,105600,"This game saved my life.

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you Re-Logic."

Terraria is a classic. It has loads of bosses, weapons, armor, items, etc. Their is a thing for everyone in this game. There is a vast building system, a huge combat system, and more. This game is only $10 and it goes on sale often. If you haven't played this game yet, give it a try. It is super cheap, and is one of my favorite games EVER. One con is that their is large amount of rng in this game. Their are a lot of items that are very very rare. However, you don't actually need to grind that much."

Terraria,Adventure,105600,"At the of me writing this I just beat terraria for the first time and after overlooking everything ive done in this game it is nothing more than a masterpiece for someone who enjoys adventure games. Every weapon feels In its own way almost every item has variations with a total of 3000 Items and over 522 entries in the besticary  . there are many classes that you can play ( I chose mage for my run) with tons of different advancements in weapons that you can pick from their accessories that you can use to boost your damage damage reduction Mana cost and anything of the sort finding out about new items and telling my friends about the progress that I've made through the game some of the most fun that I've had in awhile.  every boss feels like it has a personality,  they all have unique attacks that forces you to change your thinking plan while fighting them. There are tens of NPCs that have unique voice lines and sell you different items that can be used to advance through the game . not to mention the amount of  exploration and customizing that you can do to your world making anything that comes to your mind.  Terraria is a true exploration masterpiece with gems hiding around every corner. 10/10  
"
Terraria,Adventure,105600,"This game has robbed 1000 hours of my life on PC alone now... and I can firmly say that I would recommend it to anyone. There are so many different ways to beat this game, and after playing it for well over 7 years on console and PC, it has never gotten old because of it. You could play as a specific class like melee or summoner, or a subclass such as an archer or someone who only uses yoyos, or you can mix different classes to use whichever weapons you like, and it doesn't end there. Higher difficulties, playing with friends, mods, you name it. At this point, I have played about 30-40 different FULL play-throughs of the game (modded and vanilla, solo and with friends, etc.). There may have been several major updates over the years while I played Terraria, but there was even more time in between those updates. Despite that, the community has and is continuing to produce more and more high quality content, such as the calamity mod, which feels like a whole new game while still being Terraria at its core, even after development for the game has been brought to an end. Terraria is great, and it is a game that you could never forget."

Terraria,Adventure,105600,"At the of me writing this I just beat terraria for the first time and after overlooking everything ive done in this game it is nothing more than a masterpiece for someone who enjoys adventure games. Every weapon feels In its own way almost every item has variations with a total of 3000 Items and over 522 entries in the besticary  . there are many classes that you can play ( I chose mage for my run) with tons of different advancements in weapons that you can pick from their accessories that you can use to boost your damage damage reduction Mana cost and anything of the sort finding out about new items and telling my friends about the progress that I've made through the game some of the most fun that I've had in awhile.  every boss feels like it has a personality,  they all have unique attacks that forces you to change your thinking plan while fighting them. There are tens of NPCs that have unique voice lines and sell you different items that can be used to advance through the game . not to mention the amount of  exploration and customizing that you can do to your world making anything that comes to your mind.  Terraria is a true exploration masterpiece with gems hiding around every corner. 10/10  
"
Terraria,Adventure,105600,"This game has robbed 1000 hours of my life on PC alone now... and I can firmly say that I would recommend it to anyone. There are so many different ways to beat this game, and after playing it for well over 7 years on console and PC, it has never gotten old because of it. You could play as a specific class like melee or summoner, or a subclass such as an archer or someone who only uses yoyos, or you can mix different classes to use whichever weapons you like, and it doesn't end there. Higher difficulties, playing with friends, mods, you name it. At this point, I have played about 30-40 different FULL play-throughs of the game (modded and vanilla, solo and with friends, etc.). There may have been several major updates over the years while I played Terraria, but there was even more time in between those updates. Despite that, the community has and is continuing to produce more and more high quality content, such as the calamity mod, which feels like a whole new game while still being Terraria at its core, even after development for the game has been brought to an end. Terraria is great, and it is a game that you could never forget."

Terraria,Adventure,105600,Terraria is LIFE BRO!!!!
Terraria,Adventure,105600,I believe this game is much better than Minecraft.
Terraria,Adventure,105600,"Worst game ever.

Reason: You can't shoot lemons.

Other than that: Absolutely perfect.
"
Terraria,Adventure,105600,my friend took my cactus door
Terraria,Adventure,105600,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.
"
Terraria,Adventure,105600,"I got this game for my sons but I am secretly playing at night. XD

This game is so much fun you'd never think a 2D game would ever catch your attention so much.

Very addictive, very well made and very, very fun."

The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"Imagine you're working in a 9-5 corporate job, you're done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you're never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar. While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn't the games, its you. ""Its not that games aren't fun anymore, you have gotten older"".

And then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can't wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....""Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?"" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who's dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven't felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that's shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?

And I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feeling I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven't scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""Witcher 3 TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That's how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.

Thank you CD Projekt Red. You guys are a gem. I know its 5 years late and I don't know why it took me 5 years to play this, but better late than never."

9.8/10 MASTERPIECE."
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"The definition of ""MASTERPIECE"" was made for this game!"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"if I had to choose one game to play for all eternity, this would be my instant and definite choice. there is no better rpg out there than this. (in my opinion)"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"Words can simply not describe how much I love this game, but will certainly do my best:

Characters - Existing characters such as Geralt, Triss, Ciri, Dandelion, Yen, Keira (plus Shani and Regis for the expansions) have been utilized brilliantly from the source material and used so well in the world the game has created, and boy what a world it is! The characters I previously mentioned are probably the ones that stood out for me the most, but to be honest there are so many brilliantly constructed characters (even minor ones like Bart the Rock Troll) that I simply don't know where to even begin... Geralt's interaction with most them is simply brilliant, and the game has so many amazing, memorable moments because of it (including the famous 'drinking game segment' at Kaer Morgen). You also get a logged back story for each character, most of it taken from the books and/or previous games. which is brilliant if, like me, you decided to read the books afterwards or couldn't be bothered playing through the first couple of Witcher games (although I did get through 3 stages of the original game). It's obviously more important to have this as there is alot of stuff in the game that needs back story to elaborate on, weither it be a situation or certain dialogue. Oh yes the dialogue, love love love some of conversations in this game. You can tell alot of thought and effort went into it. The character dialogue for the most part, particularly for Geralt is so complex and funny. As it is with certain other characters mind you, but Geralt's obviously stands out the most

Environment - The graphics and art design for all the environments are simply brilliant, each location had its own distinctive feel and is and absolute joy to explore (I spent about 2 weeks just exploring Skellege's oceans and vast landscapes)

Monsters/Enemies - Such a huge assorted variety, honestly you can never get bored with the variety of enemies you face. I also love that each monster has it's own unique methods of quickly being dispelled, and everytime you discover something a description will pop up in the beast log, breaking up everything into different categories aswell

Story - Soooo gooood. Honestly story elements wise, I don't think any game is going to even come remotely close. Especially given that so many of the side stories actually match, and even sometimes exceed, the complexity and epicness of the main storyline

Combat - Kept interesting through the graphic, stylized fighting and dismemberment. Aswell as the additional use of things like signs and potions. Once again you usually need to use certain combinations of things to kill my monsters more easily, particularly the more defined 'boss level' ones

Expansions - BRILLIANT. Hearts of Stone has truely amazing story and character elements. While Blood and Wine does this on a slightly lower scale but adds another beautiful environment with various new enemies to face

So basically this the best I can do to some up how epic The Witcher 3 is. But honestly, just play the damn game!!!

My Rating for this game - 10/10"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"I don't know how to describe this experience. My steam adventure started with The Witcher: Enhanced Edition game, which allowed me to open a steam account. As a console player, I didn't think I would be a computer player, but the witcher series also made me love computer controls.Also, i played the first two games with computer controls, it was fun, but witcher 3 was a game that made me buy a gamepad.The first two games really felt like I was in the game with their open worlds and quality stories. You know, there are some special games that you feel empty when finished. I guess that's how I feel right now. I tried to explore every part of the world and do side quests as much as I could, but I still couldn't get enough of it. This game is a masterpiece for me as an open world and story. There are missions that balance the border between funny and seriousness very well. It is a game that I started late but never tired of playing. I guess it's like a game series that I will play again and again after a certain time. At least it's worth seeing Geralt again ^^"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,Why are you looking at the negative reviews? Get this game!
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"What is the premise of life and how is it intertwined with destiny? Some believe that their existence is to perform grand deeds, whilst others contentedly was little girls in basins, an occupation that I earnestly desire. Geralt was one of these men who had a destiny, a goal to slaughter the mentally handicapped, whilst venturing off to pollinate with their caregivers. His aim and dedication in slaughtering the mentally deficient earnt him the ire of various human rights committees who dubbed him the White Wolf, a name inspired by his peculiar habits of skinning his prey alive, to then don them as a cloak. Geralt’s work was so effective that many, from a petulant child, to a mother, fatigued with cleaning out her handicapped child’s waste, and having to spoon fed him intangible jellies as sustenance, frequently contracted the White Wolf to slaughter whatever mouth drivelling, rabid imbecile was assigned. Often the contractors that hired Geralt to slaughter the handicapped were families, or a fuming neighbour, disgruntled over being nightly woken by a mentally handicapped banshee, slamming together two frying pans at the stroke of midnight, whilst serenading an incoherent, intelligible tune. On other occasions he was assigned high profile contracts, most prominently of them all, was the bellower of Castle Whistlewood, a contract he was issues by an individual who wishes to remain anonymous. 

The bellower of Castle Whislewood, otherwise regarded as Steven Dawson, was a distant relative of Austin Powers and was generally emotionally volatile, mentally decrepit simpleton with Tourette’s and Autism. Frequently the belower would trail after woman and utter guttural howls, coupled in with vehement obscenities such as “Hello Baby” and “Ding Dong”. All Geralt would have to do is attach an inflatable female doll, scantily clad and with a seductive pose, to a cliff face. In theory, the imbecile, observing such a hedonistic toy would wholeheartedly believe that the woman was genuine and as such would rush towards her, tripping along the way and plummeting to his demise. Unfortunately, this was not a typical case. Steven Dawson was the governing monarch of Castle Whistlewood, an enclosed building, barred away from civilisaiton and comprised of solely him and his thralls. His thralls in question were regarded as the NDSP, the National Disability Support Partners and were sworn to defend him to their dying day. This task would be relatively difficult to complete, as the bellower bore an army at his disposal, one that could call for security and otherwise repel an ill prepared assault if need be. Aware of such a fact, Geralt began to psychologically and mentally prepare. To ward of the evil spirits, he clad himself and his blades in the finest baby oils that Poland had to offer. Then he acquired a mallet to crack open the bellowers skull. Alongside the weapon, four shrapnel grenades were concocted, in the event that Geralt would be required to clear out a throng of adversaries. During preparation, Geralt simultaneously observed national disability adverts, as they left him with an inexplicable rage. After his preparation was complete, Geralt consumed a vial of LSD, bearing tinges of methamphetamine and wade his way into the castle. The initial threat that Geralt encountered was at the hands of a busty, smirking and chipper female, who was situated at the front desk. The female, upon sighting Geralt, began grinning manically, exclaiming, “Hi there, my name is Caroline, how may I help you today?” Geralt, could not believe it, this female was attempting to seduce him, he could envision it plain in her eyes, her desire to bear his offspring was ever present. Fortunately, prior to entering the facility he had warded himself from all incantations and trickery and as such saw through her ploy. The female, sensing Geralts reluctance to answer, jubilantly stated, “Hi there, are you aware that this you are in the disability support partners facility?” These words, thank the dear heavens, were the last that she ever uttered, as Geralt, desiring to elude being captivated by the seductress, hurled a shrapnel grenade at her head, likely slaughtering her instantly. Then, withdrawing a sword and raising aloft a Polish flag, he began his ascent into the hagravens fortress that Steven Dawson called home. 

Many of the harlots were slaughtered before Geralt encountered his prey. The man, Steven Dawson, was in the midst of serenading to a photograph of a blonde female. The ballad appeared self improvise, as it bore numerous raunchy lyrics and his personal depraved sexual fantasies. Geralt, being unable to endure the sirens wail for a moment more, crept up behind the bellower and promptly caved in his skull with the matter, whilst piercing his chest with a blade. Thus, the contract of the bellower was completed, with Geralt returning to his contractor with the head as evidence of the deed. Afterwards, Geralt’s reputation in the eyes of the world irrevocably altered. Many perceived him as a hero, shielding civilization from the handicapped, whilst more insidious, clandestine groups, such as the NDSP and the UNESCO vilified Geralt, condemning him on his history of virtuous acts. As such, in completing this contract, Geralt had invoked the rage of various sinister groups. Frequently, Geralt throughout roaming in various realms, such as Temeria, Novigrad and the sort was hounded by priests sent by the Catholic Church, security forces, spokespersons for the United Nations and most mobs of depraved fiends who preached about human rights. In typical Geralt fashion he slaughtered them all, whilst locating their families to seduce and copulate with.

Overall, I appreciate the plot of the Witcher 3 and have immensely enjoyed slaughtering those who are inept at tying their own shoelaces, let along being able to cognitively contemplate. Furthermore, I appreciate the games symbolism by masquerading the handicapped as fearsome abominations, bearing horns, leathery skin, bristling aggression and solely conversing in guttural howls, as it wholly depicts the fact that the handicapped are not genuinely human, but are merely abominations that perpetually teeter along the edge of insanity. In summary, Witcher 3 is a grand game and I endear all onlookers to engage upon it immediately, lest you wish to never engage in your deep rooted, primalistic desires to assault the disabled. Oy Lazare, Lazare. Tuka nis a kazali. Kolko liste po gorrach, tolko zdrave na taz kyshcha. Tervo tuka doydome, Moma momche naydome. Ya momata godete. Ya momcheto zhenete."
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"very elaborate and versatile card game, requires patience and strategic planning, not too easy and not too difficult either, the better you are at the game the more cards you can collect, there's a few side quests about some daughter too idk i didn't pay attention"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,ok so i guess im the witcher but what is a witcher also what am i hunting i dont get it
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"i have played lot of games but never rejoiced to play a game more than this. The main thing in this game is its story line and  side quests. It keeps us to play more and more. One thing in mind always carry food items and take time to upgrade your abilities time to time. Enjoy the game.

The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,What I thought & What I got. An outstanding and breathtaking game. Perfect from each every point of view. It would be more better if Geralt could do & complete some quests with his last partner (Yennefer/Triss/Ciri) after completion of all expansions (Blood & Wine and Heart of Stone). Can't wait for next part of Witcher. Uninstalling this game is really heartbreaking.
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,such a beautiful game
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,Toss a coin to this game. Yes.
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"I'm 17 hours in and just leaving the tutorial area! It's INSANE the amount of stuff you can find off the beaten path. Combat can be as complex or as basic as you like too thanks in part to the movement options in battle and the character customisation (as basic as that is at times). Get's the Sinny Stamp of Approval, a must play, even if you haven't played the previous 2."

The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""Witcher 3 TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That's how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.

Thank you CD Projekt Red. You guys are a gem. I know its 5 years late and I don't know why it took me 5 years to play this, but better late than never."

9.8/10 MASTERPIECE."
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"The definition of ""MASTERPIECE"" was made for this game!"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"if I had to choose one game to play for all eternity, this would be my instant and definite choice. there is no better rpg out there than this. (in my opinion)"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"Words can simply not describe how much I love this game, but will certainly do my best:

Characters - Existing characters such as Geralt, Triss, Ciri, Dandelion, Yen, Keira (plus Shani and Regis for the expansions) have been utilized brilliantly from the source material and used so well in the world the game has created, and boy what a world it is! The characters I previously mentioned are probably the ones that stood out for me the most, but to be honest there are so many brilliantly constructed characters (even minor ones like Bart the Rock Troll) that I simply don't know where to even begin... Geralt's interaction with most them is simply brilliant, and the game has so many amazing, memorable moments because of it (including the famous 'drinking game segment' at Kaer Morgen). You also get a logged back story for each character, most of it taken from the books and/or previous games. which is brilliant if, like me, you decided to read the books afterwards or couldn't be bothered playing through the first couple of Witcher games (although I did get through 3 stages of the original game). It's obviously more important to have this as there is alot of stuff in the game that needs back story to elaborate on, weither it be a situation or certain dialogue. Oh yes the dialogue, love love love some of conversations in this game. You can tell alot of thought and effort went into it. The character dialogue for the most part, particularly for Geralt is so complex and funny. As it is with certain other characters mind you, but Geralt's obviously stands out the most

Environment - The graphics and art design for all the environments are simply brilliant, each location had its own distinctive feel and is and absolute joy to explore (I spent about 2 weeks just exploring Skellege's oceans and vast landscapes)

Monsters/Enemies - Such a huge assorted variety, honestly you can never get bored with the variety of enemies you face. I also love that each monster has it's own unique methods of quickly being dispelled, and everytime you discover something a description will pop up in the beast log, breaking up everything into different categories aswell

Story - Soooo gooood. Honestly story elements wise, I don't think any game is going to even come remotely close. Especially given that so many of the side stories actually match, and even sometimes exceed, the complexity and epicness of the main storyline

Combat - Kept interesting through the graphic, stylized fighting and dismemberment. Aswell as the additional use of things like signs and potions. Once again you usually need to use certain combinations of things to kill my monsters more easily, particularly the more defined 'boss level' ones

Expansions - BRILLIANT. Hearts of Stone has truely amazing story and character elements. While Blood and Wine does this on a slightly lower scale but adds another beautiful environment with various new enemies to face

So basically this the best I can do to some up how epic The Witcher 3 is. But honestly, just play the damn game!!!

My Rating for this game - 10/10"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"I don't know how to describe this experience. My steam adventure started with The Witcher: Enhanced Edition game, which allowed me to open a steam account. As a console player, I didn't think I would be a computer player, but the witcher series also made me love computer controls.Also, i played the first two games with computer controls, it was fun, but witcher 3 was a game that made me buy a gamepad.The first two games really felt like I was in the game with their open worlds and quality stories. You know, there are some special games that you feel empty when finished. I guess that's how I feel right now. I tried to explore every part of the world and do side quests as much as I could, but I still couldn't get enough of it. This game is a masterpiece for me as an open world and story. There are missions that balance the border between funny and seriousness very well. It is a game that I started late but never tired of playing. I guess it's like a game series that I will play again and again after a certain time. At least it's worth seeing Geralt again ^^"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,Why are you looking at the negative reviews? Get this game!
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"What is the premise of life and how is it intertwined with destiny? Some believe that their existence is to perform grand deeds, whilst others contentedly was little girls in basins, an occupation that I earnestly desire. Geralt was one of these men who had a destiny, a goal to slaughter the mentally handicapped, whilst venturing off to pollinate with their caregivers. His aim and dedication in slaughtering the mentally deficient earnt him the ire of various human rights committees who dubbed him the White Wolf, a name inspired by his peculiar habits of skinning his prey alive, to then don them as a cloak. Geralt’s work was so effective that many, from a petulant child, to a mother, fatigued with cleaning out her handicapped child’s waste, and having to spoon fed him intangible jellies as sustenance, frequently contracted the White Wolf to slaughter whatever mouth drivelling, rabid imbecile was assigned. Often the contractors that hired Geralt to slaughter the handicapped were families, or a fuming neighbour, disgruntled over being nightly woken by a mentally handicapped banshee, slamming together two frying pans at the stroke of midnight, whilst serenading an incoherent, intelligible tune. On other occasions he was assigned high profile contracts, most prominently of them all, was the bellower of Castle Whistlewood, a contract he was issues by an individual who wishes to remain anonymous. 

The bellower of Castle Whislewood, otherwise regarded as Steven Dawson, was a distant relative of Austin Powers and was generally emotionally volatile, mentally decrepit simpleton with Tourette’s and Autism. Frequently the belower would trail after woman and utter guttural howls, coupled in with vehement obscenities such as “Hello Baby” and “Ding Dong”. All Geralt would have to do is attach an inflatable female doll, scantily clad and with a seductive pose, to a cliff face. In theory, the imbecile, observing such a hedonistic toy would wholeheartedly believe that the woman was genuine and as such would rush towards her, tripping along the way and plummeting to his demise. Unfortunately, this was not a typical case. Steven Dawson was the governing monarch of Castle Whistlewood, an enclosed building, barred away from civilisaiton and comprised of solely him and his thralls. His thralls in question were regarded as the NDSP, the National Disability Support Partners and were sworn to defend him to their dying day. This task would be relatively difficult to complete, as the bellower bore an army at his disposal, one that could call for security and otherwise repel an ill prepared assault if need be. Aware of such a fact, Geralt began to psychologically and mentally prepare. To ward of the evil spirits, he clad himself and his blades in the finest baby oils that Poland had to offer. Then he acquired a mallet to crack open the bellowers skull. Alongside the weapon, four shrapnel grenades were concocted, in the event that Geralt would be required to clear out a throng of adversaries. During preparation, Geralt simultaneously observed national disability adverts, as they left him with an inexplicable rage. After his preparation was complete, Geralt consumed a vial of LSD, bearing tinges of methamphetamine and wade his way into the castle. The initial threat that Geralt encountered was at the hands of a busty, smirking and chipper female, who was situated at the front desk. The female, upon sighting Geralt, began grinning manically, exclaiming, “Hi there, my name is Caroline, how may I help you today?” Geralt, could not believe it, this female was attempting to seduce him, he could envision it plain in her eyes, her desire to bear his offspring was ever present. Fortunately, prior to entering the facility he had warded himself from all incantations and trickery and as such saw through her ploy. The female, sensing Geralts reluctance to answer, jubilantly stated, “Hi there, are you aware that this you are in the disability support partners facility?” These words, thank the dear heavens, were the last that she ever uttered, as Geralt, desiring to elude being captivated by the seductress, hurled a shrapnel grenade at her head, likely slaughtering her instantly. Then, withdrawing a sword and raising aloft a Polish flag, he began his ascent into the hagravens fortress that Steven Dawson called home. 

Many of the harlots were slaughtered before Geralt encountered his prey. The man, Steven Dawson, was in the midst of serenading to a photograph of a blonde female. The ballad appeared self improvise, as it bore numerous raunchy lyrics and his personal depraved sexual fantasies. Geralt, being unable to endure the sirens wail for a moment more, crept up behind the bellower and promptly caved in his skull with the matter, whilst piercing his chest with a blade. Thus, the contract of the bellower was completed, with Geralt returning to his contractor with the head as evidence of the deed. Afterwards, Geralt’s reputation in the eyes of the world irrevocably altered. Many perceived him as a hero, shielding civilization from the handicapped, whilst more insidious, clandestine groups, such as the NDSP and the UNESCO vilified Geralt, condemning him on his history of virtuous acts. As such, in completing this contract, Geralt had invoked the rage of various sinister groups. Frequently, Geralt throughout roaming in various realms, such as Temeria, Novigrad and the sort was hounded by priests sent by the Catholic Church, security forces, spokespersons for the United Nations and most mobs of depraved fiends who preached about human rights. In typical Geralt fashion he slaughtered them all, whilst locating their families to seduce and copulate with.

Overall, I appreciate the plot of the Witcher 3 and have immensely enjoyed slaughtering those who are inept at tying their own shoelaces, let along being able to cognitively contemplate. Furthermore, I appreciate the games symbolism by masquerading the handicapped as fearsome abominations, bearing horns, leathery skin, bristling aggression and solely conversing in guttural howls, as it wholly depicts the fact that the handicapped are not genuinely human, but are merely abominations that perpetually teeter along the edge of insanity. In summary, Witcher 3 is a grand game and I endear all onlookers to engage upon it immediately, lest you wish to never engage in your deep rooted, primalistic desires to assault the disabled. Oy Lazare, Lazare. Tuka nis a kazali. Kolko liste po gorrach, tolko zdrave na taz kyshcha. Tervo tuka doydome, Moma momche naydome. Ya momata godete. Ya momcheto zhenete."
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"very elaborate and versatile card game, requires patience and strategic planning, not too easy and not too difficult either, the better you are at the game the more cards you can collect, there's a few side quests about some daughter too idk i didn't pay attention"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,ok so i guess im the witcher but what is a witcher also what am i hunting i dont get it
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"i have played lot of games but never rejoiced to play a game more than this. The main thing in this game is its story line and  side quests. It keeps us to play more and more. One thing in mind always carry food items and take time to upgrade your abilities time to time. Enjoy the game.

"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"One of the best games ever made, no doubt about it."
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,The Witcher 3 is a great card game with a nice open world.
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,Best game ever played
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"very good gameplay,kinda never ending ( wich i love) ,full of monsters and mythology creatures,customizeable character skills,story rich and ...
one of the games you should play"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"Yenn > Triss
Best game btw, 10/10"
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,What I thought & What I got. An outstanding and breathtaking game. Perfect from each every point of view. It would be more better if Geralt could do & complete some quests with his last partner (Yennefer/Triss/Ciri) after completion of all expansions (Blood & Wine and Heart of Stone). Can't wait for next part of Witcher. Uninstalling this game is really heartbreaking.
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,such a beautiful game
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,Toss a coin to this game. Yes.
The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"I'm 17 hours in and just leaving the tutorial area! It's INSANE the amount of stuff you can find off the beaten path. Combat can be as complex or as basic as you like too thanks in part to the movement options in battle and the character customisation (as basic as that is at times). Get's the Sinny Stamp of Approval, a must play, even if you haven't played the previous 2."

The Forest,Adventure,242760,really good and fun to play with friends that chop trees near your structures and suddenly the structure is gone hmmmmmm
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"This game saved my life.

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.
"
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"es un juego el cual es de mi agrado ya que por el poco espacio que utiliza en la computadora, esta bastante completo y se puede pasar un muy buen rato con tus amigos, pero ultimamente la pase mal porque soy un cagon de mierda, y me da miedo cuando aparecen los otros wachines : /
Recomendadisimo porque es un muy buen juego..."
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"Everytime I play this game I am weirdly tense. Once the enemies actually arrive? I am calm again. The anticipation gets me every time. I hate it. 
Also this game is incredibly bugged. I flew like 50m high, fell down and died after I ran trough a bush with a log sled.
10/10 this game is incredibly fun with friends (i would wait until it's on sale if you plan on buying it though)"

The Forest,Adventure,242760,"This game saved my life.

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The Forest,Adventure,242760,"es un juego el cual es de mi agrado ya que por el poco espacio que utiliza en la computadora, esta bastante completo y se puede pasar un muy buen rato con tus amigos, pero ultimamente la pase mal porque soy un cagon de mierda, y me da miedo cuando aparecen los otros wachines : /
Recomendadisimo porque es un muy buen juego..."
The Forest,Adventure,242760,"Everytime I play this game I am weirdly tense. Once the enemies actually arrive? I am calm again. The anticipation gets me every time. I hate it. 
Also this game is incredibly bugged. I flew like 50m high, fell down and died after I ran trough a bush with a log sled.
10/10 this game is incredibly fun with friends (i would wait until it's on sale if you plan on buying it though)"

The Forest,Adventure,242760,"i love to play idk what to say xD
this game is good btw"
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Ark - Its hard to describe. 

Is it fun. Yep, if your doing your own server your going to really enjoy it. 

If your on official servers PVE.  The servers tend to accumulate a 10/1 Chineese to Other player base.  They will make massive structures and put out max dino's most the time.  This will cause some servers to crash so often that the EU/NA players can't even use the servers. 

For example GenOne.  There are servers that are 9000 days where the other servers are now hitting 10000 days in game.  That means 1/10 of the time more probably more the server was rebooting, destroying play time of players, and causing transferred characters to be deleted.   I believe wildcard tried to region restrict the servers a while back but failed to accomplish this simple task.  It actually cause more Chineese to move to NA servers for example, MANY more. 

SO worst part of the game, severe lag.  If your unlucky enough to find one where the BOX tribes took over. Its going to be MUCH worse.    

I'll still give the game 4.5/5 but be warned.  Ask before building on a server.  The lag spikes and crashes can be extreme.  Also if the server is 500+ days behind its other near numbered brothers... Its a lagbomb/crasher that probably has some box tribe exploit base built inside a restricted area causing it to crash often as people try to use it.  

5000 hours+ played, it is very fun if you find the right server.   Also pre-Transfer you will really enjoy official servers.  After that though the box tribes will cause havoc as they migrate massive numbers of structures and vaults to the server."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,dinosaurs poop in this game
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I desperately want to like this game. On paper, it's everything I could ask for. Dinosaurs and prehistoric beasts! Taming, equipping, feeding them! Going exploring with epic mounts and hunting companions! Gradually building up a base that rivals the grandest of fortresses!

I want to like this game, but it's just too damn buggy. I was able to tolerate it for a while, where it would be frustrating but I could deal. The lost dinosaurs, the clipping, the stupid deaths, the building issues, whatever.

But then my prized Sarcosuchus ended up instantly dying when I was swimming and happened to brush the shoreline. I was very upset, but I went out and captured another one. Then, about five minutes after taming the new one, the exact same thing happened again.

It turns out the the Sarcosuchus's natural sprint speed is fast enough that it insta-kills it if it touches the shoreline, because for some reason the sprint speed is converted to fall damage. The solution to this bug? Just don't sprint, or don't use the Sarcosuchus. A known issue since 2018 that far as I know still hasn't been fixed. Just one of many user complaints that have not been addressed, and it was the last straw for me.

There's so much to like in this game, but the lack of polish just ends up ruining the experience. And it's such a tragedy, because this could really have been my most played game of all time."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,This is a fun game i love the concept of it and the curve balls they put in this game is really good graphics and is worth buying
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I still remember the first time I played this game. I started out on a solo server. Had no clue what I was doing since there was no tutorial at the time, and the game was in early stages. Chain died to dilo's, raptors. Made a small shit shack out of wood. Huddled in a dark corner in pitch darkness hoping my stuff wasn't going to get destroyed by the raptors outside. Fought my way through them by cheesing them using elevation to my advantage. Found my first high lvl dino 120 trike (Max lvl at the time). Took 6 hours to tame with hand picked berries and narcotics to try and keep it down. More raptors kept spawning and trying to get at my trike buddy, but I prevailed. Tamed out only a few levels higher, due to harassment from the raptors. That thing was a beast, ripped through alpha raptors with constant knock back. Killed tons of carnos. Until an alpha rex snuck up on me in pitch darkness and ate my poor buddy. 

I thought I was ready for pvp after that experience gained. Spawned on the beach and went for the same spot to build my wood shack. At the time the alpha tribe of the server was pretty close (Server 1) Veras Vanguard. They came with argies and forcefully told me to relocate my shit shack somewhere else. I said NAH! Instantly picked off by the argy and went for a ride of a life time from a cliff to my death. I chucked a few sling shot rocks at their dinos and killed a few of them off. Merely to be a pest in my sorrow because of my base being ruined. 

This was when I realized to make it anywhere in pvp I must join a tribe to survive. At the time I heard Spartans was a big tribe and Barrys Seals. I felt more welcome in Seals, so that's where my pvp experience began. Raiding other mega tribes, killing countless dinos and players. That's what makes this game great, playing it with other people and creating a community around it.

Ark as a game is a rollercoaster ride. You always have your ups and downs. It's the best survival game I have ever played. The others don't come close to it. The things that make this game so epic is when you think you made it far and can't possibly be killed ark will always say ""Hold my beer"" as it proceeds to reap your soul from your body with a carefully planted troodon. Or an underwater scorpion that knocks you out before you could even shit your pants. Or another player sneaking up on you and smacking you over the head with a club. 

I started on pvp server and ignored the story completely. From a beach bob to a semi-big tribe to a mega. Each had its stories and community of people. Made some friends, enemies which both lead to epic battles.

This game has its share of countless bugs, I wish the developers spent more time fixing those before proceeding to create more content and DLC's. 

As a whole I would recommend this game to people, but know what kind of player you are. PVP is mostly for people who have a large community and can take turns looking after bases, and mostly ignore the story of the game. PvE is more geared for casual players who don't have the time to maintain bases against others and just want to experience the story of the game or RP away with mods.

"
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Oh man, this game is great. Learn to live with lag and frame drops. Do not enable damage numbers unless you hate your PC. Inbreed your favourite dogs to make the best boy dogs. Spend all your day trying to get your dinosaurs organised and have it all destroyed by a fat-fingered tribemate.

But have you ever seen a baby otter? 5/5 stars."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Note: I play on official (PvE) servers. If you pick up this game I recommend looking for a private server or renting your own. Can be fun and has a lot of potential but I can't give it a positive review for the official server experience- for a game that requires a huge amount of time to be sunk in to progress, it's beyond frustrating that you can lose literally hundreds of hours of work to bugs and random server glitches. GMs will try to be helpful (if they respond at all), but you'll likely be told there is nothing that can be done. Servers are insanely laggy, especially on world-save intervals, and you will likely have multiple crashes and rollbacks a day depending on which server you are on. It's not uncommon for a server to go down for days at a time.

Recently my tribe had half of our cryofridges go dead despite being powered and on the same grid as others that were fine and fully charged, and we lost all the dinos (hundreds in total) in them. Might not be a big deal for larger tribes with more people who can recover more easily, but we are only two people. Losing a fridge full of Gigas we had raised and fully imprinted was a huge bummer, not to mention a bunch of event color dinos that we won't have access to for another year.

Bugs like that and many more have been documented for years now and they *still* exist, that's pretty unacceptable given how much of a grind it is to do anything in ARK. I see the appeal in the game, and I might still play casually... but I'm no longer sinking that time and dedication into a game that will only fuck me over in the long run, and I won't be buying ARK 2 unless Wildcard really turn themselves around. Such a shame since it's really a very fun concept, but there are many other open-world survival games out there that are stable and are much more deserving of your time and energy."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Would you like to play on servers where every single source of metal is blocked by an indestructible metal pillar? Want to lose months of progress because you got bombed overnight? Want to spend every waking hour checking into ARK to make sure your tames didn't get killed, only to eventually realize the game isn't even fun now - it's just work? Do you enjoy constant crashes, gamebreaking bugs, and low fps? ARK is the game for you!

Edit: Looks like Ark is on sale at 10 dollars at the moment. While I don't think ARK is worth the full $50, it's definitely worth it at $10"
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,Remember do not play official server
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Expectantly disappointing

     It is an mmo after all, much of the experience is derived from the other players of the game and although I have made some friends through playing I don't think I could recommend this game to people for the following criticism: extreme unbalance in public servers. Making dinos transferable is one of the worst decisions made by the ark team and although it is available to be turned off in server settings, many if not all of the official serves do not do so. This doesn't seem like a problem until someone from another server comes in with a end game, max level dino, flattens a whole server and then leaves again in a raid style. For this very reason people flock to dead servers to try to build up then go raid another server and then return to their 'safe' server where they can't be touched.

     In terms of performance, the game runs fine, if resource heavy. Graphics are alright, other than the blinding bloom and sun shafts, which cannot be adjusted to my knowledge other than through the gamma level and can be prevented from being adjusted server-side.

     For play with a group of friends on your own server, I think this game could be perfect, but it is not viable to play with the general public as of this very moment."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I'd recommend this game but with some caveats, but we'll get to that.

First and foremost: survival game with dinosaurs, multiplayer, base-building and optionally PvP. Heck yes.
I don't like spoiling things too much, but dinosaurs and animals are a core part of the player's engagement in the game, not just the enemies of the world you have to deal with.

However, the game is sometimes extremely rough around the edges.

Having played this as a dino fan myself and with a dino freak friend, we could look past the issues of jankiness, but it did definitely test my patience at times.

If you're the type of player who can look past some flaws and stick with a game simply due to the theme or feel appealing to you more than usual, I'd recommend giving this a go.
If, on the other hand, polish, quality and user experience are paramount, maybe try this at a deep deep sale or simply do not even pick it up.

If you do decide to pick it up, ask around for a friend who knows their way around all the different map options and server parameters etc. because those can also very much change your experience, and make or break the game for you!

As an exemple, the first map I tried out made me want to get a refund, but with some research and setting up, I've had the time of my life in the Ragnarok map.

Dinos are cool."

ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,Toxic community and greedy devs are more concerned with releasing game-breaking DLC than fixing game breaking bugs
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I thought that this game looked dumb, some half dressed woman ridding on a dino, but, once I had played it for over an hour I knew it was going to be one of my very favorite games of all times. And it is. It truly is an amazing game as far as survival and exploration, and if you like dinosaurs its a huge bonus."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"The learning curve on this game is EXTREME. There is virtually no in game guide on what your first few hours in the game should look like, and even online videos are not that helpful. Once you get past the initial steep learning curve on how to actually progress through the game, it is quite enjoyable. There is so much detail in every map, dinosaur, and land feature. The possibilities in this game are truly endless and unique and there is a lot to enjoy in this game. 7/10"
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"fun game, i recommend it. what i DON'T reccomend is exiting the window while on the loading screen, since it completely freezes the game."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,haha dino go grrrrrrrrr
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"1) ark features physically and mentally unhealthy game design in the taming, breeding and farming systems. 

2) the pvp community is among the most toxic spaces that i have ever experienced. this is a problem that wildcard can impact by attentively banning people for harassment, something that they plainly in doing relative to the standards that other games currently uphold.

3) rampant QC issues. there are holes in the mesh. there are aimbots. there are vision hacks. there are dupe bugs. the pvp servers of ark have been in a state for years where your tribe has two choices: either cheat (duping, primarily) or be a ""beta tribe"" of a tribe that does cheat. there is no other way to survive on pvp.

i think it's reasonable to play the game despite #3. just about every game has bugs and if the game is fun enough a lot of people are willing to deal with just about anything. however #1 and #2 are so damaging to the prospective player that i would not recommend this game to anyone."

     In terms of performance, the game runs fine, if resource heavy. Graphics are alright, other than the blinding bloom and sun shafts, which cannot be adjusted to my knowledge other than through the gamma level and can be prevented from being adjusted server-side.

     For play with a group of friends on your own server, I think this game could be perfect, but it is not viable to play with the general public as of this very moment."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I'd recommend this game but with some caveats, but we'll get to that.

First and foremost: survival game with dinosaurs, multiplayer, base-building and optionally PvP. Heck yes.
I don't like spoiling things too much, but dinosaurs and animals are a core part of the player's engagement in the game, not just the enemies of the world you have to deal with.

However, the game is sometimes extremely rough around the edges.

Having played this as a dino fan myself and with a dino freak friend, we could look past the issues of jankiness, but it did definitely test my patience at times.

If you're the type of player who can look past some flaws and stick with a game simply due to the theme or feel appealing to you more than usual, I'd recommend giving this a go.
If, on the other hand, polish, quality and user experience are paramount, maybe try this at a deep deep sale or simply do not even pick it up.

If you do decide to pick it up, ask around for a friend who knows their way around all the different map options and server parameters etc. because those can also very much change your experience, and make or break the game for you!

As an exemple, the first map I tried out made me want to get a refund, but with some research and setting up, I've had the time of my life in the Ragnarok map.

Dinos are cool."

ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,Toxic community and greedy devs are more concerned with releasing game-breaking DLC than fixing game breaking bugs
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I thought that this game looked dumb, some half dressed woman ridding on a dino, but, once I had played it for over an hour I knew it was going to be one of my very favorite games of all times. And it is. It truly is an amazing game as far as survival and exploration, and if you like dinosaurs its a huge bonus."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"The learning curve on this game is EXTREME. There is virtually no in game guide on what your first few hours in the game should look like, and even online videos are not that helpful. Once you get past the initial steep learning curve on how to actually progress through the game, it is quite enjoyable. There is so much detail in every map, dinosaur, and land feature. The possibilities in this game are truly endless and unique and there is a lot to enjoy in this game. 7/10"
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"fun game, i recommend it. what i DON'T reccomend is exiting the window while on the loading screen, since it completely freezes the game."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,haha dino go grrrrrrrrr
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"1) ark features physically and mentally unhealthy game design in the taming, breeding and farming systems. 

2) the pvp community is among the most toxic spaces that i have ever experienced. this is a problem that wildcard can impact by attentively banning people for harassment, something that they plainly in doing relative to the standards that other games currently uphold.

3) rampant QC issues. there are holes in the mesh. there are aimbots. there are vision hacks. there are dupe bugs. the pvp servers of ark have been in a state for years where your tribe has two choices: either cheat (duping, primarily) or be a ""beta tribe"" of a tribe that does cheat. there is no other way to survive on pvp.

i think it's reasonable to play the game despite #3. just about every game has bugs and if the game is fun enough a lot of people are willing to deal with just about anything. however #1 and #2 are so damaging to the prospective player that i would not recommend this game to anyone."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"its alright, not shrek 2 on dvd, but its aight."
ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I love survival games and this is better than The Forest
I enjoyed it so far let's see if i can play it for the next 300 hours"

Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Better than among us
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"""The game is titled 'Don't Starve' and the objective is to, not starve. So yes; I would call that good game design.""
—Shigeru Miyamoto"
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,starved :)
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Much easier than it's multiplayer counterpart. Better for playing solo.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"Fun little game, but it's a bit too much grind for my taste and it's not clear what to do and where to go.

I like games from this dev and have played almost all of their releases.

Worth for people who like survival games. It's a steal for how much it costs right now on sale (2 euros)."
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,good.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,it is very hard but after you learn what to do it slowly gets easy
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,after Klei started to work with Tencent this game should not me in indie category. But the game is still good
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,It's a funny twist on modern neoclassical grim dark humour.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,There is so much more to this game than meets the eye. It's kind of like a more high-stakes version of Animal Crossing or a more entertaining version of Minecraft.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,even if the captain of the titanic had full 24 hour notice of where the iceberg was and slammed into it intentionally he would have done a better job than the devs of this game. 10/10 would recommend
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Very good rogue-like survival game.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Great game. Much fun to be had. Good luck surviving.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"Essentiallt, Tim Burton's Minecraft with a bit of story. If you're into the gothic aesthitic and dark humor, highly recomend"
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"This is hands down my favourite game. I love all the different expansion packs, and it's very affordable."
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Although this game is years old I have only been able to play it on Steam recently. I have played it on my Switch numerous times and always enjoyed the game. I was looking to get Oxygen Not Included on here but when I saw the bundle with DS and DST I thought it was worth getting that instead of just ONI. There are some differences between DS and DST which I look forward to finding more of as I further my progress in each game.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,what da dog doin
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"Don't Starve is one of those challenging games that grab your attention and make you not want to stop playing even though it's hard.
Walkthrough a gigantic map, collect resources, die, learn, find out how to survive longer, die again, get better, improve your survival skills, eventually die and let the cycle repeat itself. It's not just the extremely charismatic, well-made, and unique art, or the wonderfully well-designed and creative world that gives this game a unique touch, a special place in any player's library. The mechanics and survival challenges are very well done, placed in such a way that each discovery makes you even more willing to try to survive (it's true that sometimes you get pretty lost not knowing what to do, but it's part of the experience). Don't Starve is a difficult game that will punish you at any opportunity and will encourage you to improve as a player in order to escape adversity and survive for more days.
For those more hardcore gamers who are tired of surviving for long days, the adventure mode reserves a really big challenge that will test the player's skill to the max.
The map options and their features leave to the player's liking whether you want a more intense or milder challenge, adapt the map to your style and stay immersed in the game because it is amazing!"

Don't Starve,Indie,219740,they tell u not to starve so i didnt because im a LEGEND!!!
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Better than among us
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"""The game is titled 'Don't Starve' and the objective is to, not starve. So yes; I would call that good game design.""
—Shigeru Miyamoto"
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,starved :)
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"sometimes games just click with people. i couldn't really tell you why i love this game so much, but the way it FEELS to play- i have died hundreds of times after 20+ hour games just to sigh and start again. I've done almost everything there is to do and it still gives me a sense of atmosphere and calm that only a game like this could do. Bravo."
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Much easier than it's multiplayer counterpart. Better for playing solo.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"Fun little game, but it's a bit too much grind for my taste and it's not clear what to do and where to go.

I like games from this dev and have played almost all of their releases.

Worth for people who like survival games. It's a steal for how much it costs right now on sale (2 euros)."
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,good.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,it is very hard but after you learn what to do it slowly gets easy
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,after Klei started to work with Tencent this game should not me in indie category. But the game is still good
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,It's a funny twist on modern neoclassical grim dark humour.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,There is so much more to this game than meets the eye. It's kind of like a more high-stakes version of Animal Crossing or a more entertaining version of Minecraft.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,even if the captain of the titanic had full 24 hour notice of where the iceberg was and slammed into it intentionally he would have done a better job than the devs of this game. 10/10 would recommend
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Very good rogue-like survival game.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Great game. Much fun to be had. Good luck surviving.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"Essentiallt, Tim Burton's Minecraft with a bit of story. If you're into the gothic aesthitic and dark humor, highly recomend"
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"This is hands down my favourite game. I love all the different expansion packs, and it's very affordable."
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,Although this game is years old I have only been able to play it on Steam recently. I have played it on my Switch numerous times and always enjoyed the game. I was looking to get Oxygen Not Included on here but when I saw the bundle with DS and DST I thought it was worth getting that instead of just ONI. There are some differences between DS and DST which I look forward to finding more of as I further my progress in each game.
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,what da dog doin
Don't Starve,Indie,219740,"Don't Starve is one of those challenging games that grab your attention and make you not want to stop playing even though it's hard.
Walkthrough a gigantic map, collect resources, die, learn, find out how to survive longer, die again, get better, improve your survival skills, eventually die and let the cycle repeat itself. It's not just the extremely charismatic, well-made, and unique art, or the wonderfully well-designed and creative world that gives this game a unique touch, a special place in any player's library. The mechanics and survival challenges are very well done, placed in such a way that each discovery makes you even more willing to try to survive (it's true that sometimes you get pretty lost not knowing what to do, but it's part of the experience). Don't Starve is a difficult game that will punish you at any opportunity and will encourage you to improve as a player in order to escape adversity and survive for more days.
For those more hardcore gamers who are tired of surviving for long days, the adventure mode reserves a really big challenge that will test the player's skill to the max.
The map options and their features leave to the player's liking whether you want a more intense or milder challenge, adapt the map to your style and stay immersed in the game because it is amazing!"
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,does this count as half life 3?
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,just another example of valve doing an excellent job
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Half-Life Alyx easily makes up for the 15+ years of waiting for Half-Life 3. I can only hope HL3 is this good. I highly recommend playing this on the Valve Index, as it is truly worth the price.

Graphics:
-Insane. I played on ultra fidelity at high refresh rate since my PC can handle it. There is a substantial difference between good graphics on a monitor VS in VR. I'm not quite sure how they accomplished it, as most areas look insanely real. Lighting with a flashlight or laser acts in the way my brain would expect it to, and the amount of detail on simple things such as a notification posted on a wall made me want to constantly stop and look around the environment. The environments alone make this game worth playing, and are a technological marvel.

Combat:
-Unlike anything I've ever played. Using iron sights on weapons requires you to use one eye, just as you would in real life. Manually having to eject a handgun magazine, grab a new one from your backpack, slam it into the gun, then chamber a round is incredibly fun and satisfying. Reloading in itself is a task that requires mastering, and never gets old. This creates a lot of tense moments of fun, such as being grabbed by a barnacle, only to realize you had two bullets left in the magazine and now need to panic reload. I dropped multiple magazines of ammo trying to panic reload in combat, and this only adds to the realism and tension. The shotgun is similar; having to manually chamber shells, then slam the bolt to load. Never gets old. Also, throwing grenades feels extremely intuitive and natural (IF USING THE VALVE INDEX), and objects throw in the way I'd expect them to. If you have a larger play space, you can physically move around to duck behind cover,  walk through doors with your gun ready, shoot around corners, dodge projectiles, etc.

Puzzles:
-Clever use of interaction and physics makes puzzles really interesting and fun in a way that you haven't encountered in other games. Defusing bombs for example is essentially a minigame of trying to carefully thread a needle through small rings without touching them, while being on a timer. Your success is purely based upon your dexterity, and if you fail it all blows up in your face (literally).

Audio:
-I played using the Valve Index, which has the built-in headphones that float near your ears. These provided the most realistic environmental sound I've ever experienced in a game. I'm not sure how Valve even accomplished this. There is excellent kick and bass to guns and things in the environment. At one point I took my VR headset off because I thought an actual bee was in my apartment, but it was the game.

Story:
-I don't want to spoil anything, but the story was FAR better than I thought it would be, and adds A LOT of intriguing questions to the series. There are some extremely key moments in the game that make you stop and be like O_O


TLDR:
-Half-Life Alyx is a technological marvel, and easily makes up for the 15+ year wait for Half-Life 3. I can only hope Half-Life 3 is this good. Far and away one of the most incredible experiences in gaming I've ever had. I 100% recommend buying a Valve Index to play this, since the game was designed specifically for it. Being able to fully open your hand to throw objects or sift through a box of supplies is FAR more immersive, and the built-in audio system of the Index is phenomenal. Even without it though, you will enjoy this."

Update 6.18.21: Hungry,  going back in, must eat Snark..."
Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"I don't even know where to begin... as a long-time gamer and Half Life fan, and early adopter of VR (and all its shortcomings), I didn't understand the hype around this game.  I mean... a Half Life game that wasn't a shooter?  How would you get around the semi-stationary limitations of VR?  Would this be jumping from room to room, shooting at targets that pop out, then moving to the next stationary point?  How cool could that really be?

Well... let me assure you, this game is somehow better than all the (absurd amount of) hype, combined.  This is not only a showcase of what VR can be TODAY, but an incredible honor to the Half-Life franchise.  It's simply put, amazing.  The incredible detail and immersion of environments in this game, the puzzles incorporated throughout, and the semi RPG elements (customization of weapons), along with the scarcity of ammo and thus danger of encounters, makes for an amazingly tense game... and one in which I've spent far too long just looking around in awe.

This is currently THE game to try, hands down.  For the record, I'm 11 hours in and still not done - so this isn't the usual 1-2 hours of VR gameplay for $40-60.  Try it, be amazed, and get ready for what this spurs the VR industry to make next! :)

Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,i wanna eat a peking duck with my dad
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Everything about it is great. Only downside to this game is that there is no Shun Akiyama.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,I was expecting not to like this series becoming a jrpg but boy was I wrong
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"I held off on getting this game for a while, I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy the turn based combat instead of the traditional beat em up. I'm glad I bought this game and I wish I had sooner. This has become my favorite of the franchise and one of the best games I've ever played. The story is incredible and filled with brilliantly written and acted characters. 

The protagonist, Ichiban, has quite the boots to fill now that we're not playing as Kiryu anymore. Ichiban is an amazing protagonist and without question does Kiryu justice. The emotional range is wider, and the positive outlook on everything that Ichiban invigorates sets him apart from Kiryu. They're both masterpieces of character development, writing and acting. 

The gameplay is incredibly fun and addicting. Leveling up your character as well as the Job you have set at any given time. Jobs are essentially specializations that incorporate different roles like healing, magic/melee, or even tanking. There's tons of loot, materials for crafting gear, and an enormous variety of enemy designs. Since the game has taken this turn into JRPG territory it's allowed more traditional aspects of other RPGs. There's dungeons, tons of bosses and minibosses, an endgame activity that's very difficult, and more. There's well over 100 hours worth of content here and it all improves you and your party's abilities. 

My complaints are negligible, there's sometimes too many enemies on the streets. That's pretty much it, Yakuza Like A Dragon is near perfect and a must play for anyone who's played the previous games and for anyone who wants to jump for the first time into this universe. Playing the previous games isn't necessary."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Unironically one of the best games i've played so far
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"Right, where do I start...

Yakuza: Like a Dragon (later in this review Yakuza 7) has been my introduction to the Yakuza franchise as a whole. Prior to this, all I knew about was the Bakamitai meme, which I also only knew as the Dame Da Ne song. I was a bit sceptical about getting into it at first, as I knew absolutely nothing about the game and franchise as a whole, and Brawlers weren't really my thing, but then I heard that this game features a different protagonist, and instead of a Brawler, plays as a turn based RPG. I had some money left over from Christmas, and I'm a big fan of the old Final Fantasy games, so I thought I might as well give it a try. Could always refund it if I didn't enjoy it. 

In Yakuza 7, you play as Ichiban Kasuga, a Yakuza grunt who goes to jail to cover for a higher-ranking member of the Arakawa family, which he belongs to. Thinking that this would make him climb the Yakuza ladder, and that his patriarch will honour and appreciate his cover, he comes back after 18 years of prison time to find out that everybody had abandoned him. Former police officer Koichi Adachi researched about the Tojo Clan and the Arakawa Family, attempts to convince Ichiban to come with him to Yokohama to stay safe, but Ichiban refuses. Ichiban finds his way back to his former patriarch and is then met with an unfortunate fate.

Oh boy, I was immediately hooked from the start. ""That's a lot of cutscenes for a game, it's like I'm watching a movie"" was my first thought. I liked story heavy games, but I felt a little overwhelmed on my first day, as out of the probably 5 or 6 hours that I was playing, 4 of them were just watching cutscenes. Now this might turn some people down, especially if they just want to enjoy the gameplay, but all the introductory scenes got me more invested in finding out about the presented characters and I didn't just want to stop playing until I found a point where I thought ""Okay, now the actual game finally begins.""

The vast majority of this game takes plays in the streets of Yokohama, more specifically, Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama's red light district. The world is incredibly detailed and you'll be pleasantly surprised to know that there's things hidden in every single corner. I really enjoy exploring in video games, trying to see if there's things hidden in places nobody would think of and-- to my surprise, they really thought of everything here. I try sneaking into a corner that I think might not even be intended to go to, and yet, there's something there for me to pick up. 

I personally went for the ""50% main story, 50% side story"" approach, which to me means - I'll do 2 or 3 side quests, of which there are plenty in Yakuza 7, and then I'll do a few story quests so that I can keep up with what is happening. And trust me, there's a lot of content to burn through. All of the sidequests are very well designed, and most of them got at least a little bit of a chuckle from me, so I'd like to think that they are quite humorous. Once done with the sidequests, I grabbed my imaginary bucket of popcorn and started getting immersed in the story. 

After I arrived in Yokohama, and the game properly begun for me, I thought to myself that this would be a silly little hero adventure. One of a redemption arc where Ichiban becomes the hero of a big and epic tale. Well, it's kinda like that, it starts off slow and adventurous, but the more the story goes on, Ichiban falls deeper into this crime drama rabbit hole. I will not spoil anything for the sake of letting you enjoy it by yourself, but I can say you're in for a treat. A big one. 

The gameplay itself is, as mentioned earlier, a turn based RPG. I hit you, then I wait, then you hit me, and then you wait. Yakuza 7 adds a nice little twist to that by adding small, simple QTEs to most of your abilities. Sometimes you might have to press a button repeatedly to give it more power, sometimes you might need to press the button at the proper time instead. Sometimes even both! It's a very, very simple thing but it keeps the combat entertaining, which is the main purpose. All attack animations look nice and polished too, some of the names and descriptions are silly and will put a weird look on your face when you first see it, but all skills feels nice to use. You might not have many skills when you first start the game, but the more you progress, the more and more skills will be added to your arsenal.

This game works in a job system, which you might be familiar with if you played some Final Fantasy games. While each character has their own primary main job, they can also switch to other jobs, which in this game are gender locked. Male characters can choose from a variety of different jobs, and female characters have their own jobs to choose from, too. Some of these jobs exist for both genders, although slightly altered, such as Host for males and Hostess for females. They essentially do the same thing, yet they slightly differ from one another.

Now, apart from the amazing story that this game has to offer, and the ability to throw ridiculous-looking skills at your enemies, there's also plenty of minigames that you can play in this game. Of course, there's Karaoke (also with Bakamitai!), Mahjong, Shogi and Dragon Kart (yes, like actual kart racing) just to name a few. Each of these felt well thought out and they're fun to do, and you can seriously get invested in them if you're dedicated enough. Sometimes I booted this game up just to play a little bit of Mahjong...

But there's probably a few negatives about this game, right? Yes there are, but in my personal opinion, these are just minor things that probably won't even bother you unless you think really hard about it. What I disliked during my playthrough is that there's just. so. many. random. encounters. I was told by a friend that this is common in the Yakuza games, and that you'll have to just deal with it, but god there's just so many. Happens a lot that you walk down one street and you get hit with 3 or 4 different encounters that really badly want to murder you. There is an item in this game that completely removes random encounters, but I feel like you'll get access to it way too late. By the time you have it, you're probably able to finish the game for good already. Another issue that I had in this game is that there was one dungeon that just felt way too long to complete. It wasn't even challenging or anything, you just entered a new floor and thought ""this is it"", only to be hit with a wave of disappointment as you realize this is just another floor with the same enemies as the last one. It was a slog to get through it, but luckily it's only a one time thing.

So, what can I say to finalize this review? I think that Yakuza 7 is an amazing game, with a well written and properly thought out story that is guaranteed to keep you glued to your screen, fun and entertaining combat to keep you playing, and a wide variety of different minigames that you grind out, or even just relax with if you feel like. Ichiban and his party makes it feel like you're part of the crew, that his achievements and goals are yours too, and that you too can overcome any obstacle if you just believe in yourself and don't give up. Ichiban Kasuga has been one of the most relateable characters I have ever met and he's found a place in my heart that I will protect. This game has also made me buy all the other main Yakuza games and I'm motivated to play through all of them, at the time of this review I am currently on Yakuza 4 Remastered. As I found out while playing, there are plenty of references to the older Yakuza games that will make you go ""Oooh, I know this"" when you see them, and they still don't feel out of place when you're new to it. I am very happy that this game introduced me to the series and I have no shame admitting that I cried when it was over."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"Heartfelt and great story telling with Final Fantasy/Dragon Quest combat? Awesome!
Never played a Dragon Quest before this one but I think I'll have to say that it's my favorite one. 
The story is great and there are so many minigames within that can keep you hooked especially with the wackiness that happens based on the side quests and even the different classes.

Cutscenes are super long but aside from that, the story is like a really really long movie."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"As a Yakuza game, its about what you expect. The game is at times a soap opera, then its grounded in reality and then its goes to some REALLY bizarre and absurd places, and thats just great. Ichiban is NOT Kiryu, we trade super manly ideal super strong dad for a gold hearted goofball badass idiot, and its kind of okay, hes way less of a power fantasy and more of a relatable character thats struggling to make it in life, which at times hits too close to home. As an rpg, its kinda clunky and not too deep, visually its very good. The narrative is what I enjoyed the most from this game, and its pretty good. 8/10, worth your time and money."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"[i]--This [b]will[/b] contain some big spoilers. Don't yell at me.--[/i]

The newest entry into the Yakuza franchise, and RGG's first foray into the jRPG genre -- and generally, what a blast this is. It's captivated me with every step and turn, and kept me hooked until the very end -- even with some of its questionable design decisions later in the main storyline.

The game starts out kind of slow, with you learning the ropes in a restrictive tutorial zone throughout Kamurocho. Luckily, this is not how the game stays, and Kamurocho is luckily only a bit of set dressing in this game. Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama, is where the real meat is at -- a delightfully large map (by RGG standards, being that it's four times the size of Kamurocho) with a lot to explore and take in. This is what the game really was designed around, and where the jRPG shenanigans really get into full swing.

Isezaki Ijincho is divided into districts -- each with their own taxi locations that you have to *discover* before you can use them to travel to those locations, making you actually explore and discover Isezaki Ijincho for yourself -- that all have their own ""threat levels."" These threat levels are the game's way of telling you how strong the enemies in an area are -- and thus, how much of a threat they are to you. I love this, I wish more jRPGs told me this info. It's fantastic, and makes the experience of roaming a lot easier, and grinding even easier.

The main story follows Kasuga and his ragtag group of friends throughout the bustling city of Yokohama, as they find themselves slowly wedged into a feud. Bleach Japan are a group that want to cleanse the city of its ""gray zones,"" by any means necessary -- including using Yakuza muscle. Their interactions with BJ, as well as their work for a soapland, eventually lead them to walk into a sprung trap; from there, they really devolve into their big feud, with many twists and turns abound. As always, these games will find a way to make you emotional, and this one might be the most effective at that yet.

As far as gameplay goes, RGG went for a simplistic, but delightful approach. You still roam about the city freely, like any Yakuza game, and the encounters still work similarly as the previous brawler entries -- but it's here where the big twist lies; Upon entering a battle, you are thrown into a very modern jRPG battle system: a simple menu divided into four halves, each for specific functions, your HP/MP counters, and a nice automatic battle system you can opt into and give light directions to. The four-button menu is neatly divided: Attack, Guard, Skills and Miscellaneous. The first three are fairly self-explanatory, and the latter brings you into a second menu for two more items, depending on whose turn it currently is: Items, and if you're Kasuga and have unlocked it, Poundmates. The poundmates are your summons, and include a wild variety from people you meet through sidequests and even a couple through the main story. They're awesome, and a great aid during battles.

Another core mechanic of the game is the Jobs system, which defines what skills, perks and weapons a character can use. Not all characters can have the same jobs, and most of them have in-game requirements to unlock; But rest assured, they're all great and with their own perks, and really allow you to build a good team for your preferred play style. Not to mention they're plenty wacky, with often goofy visuals and animations, to really ham up the silliness of the RPG battle system and its surrounding mechanics.

As I mentioned though, the game does have some critical flaws that have certainly gotten me a bit... [i]annoyed[/i] with the game -- namely how level scaling and difficulty curve intertwine. Up to chapter 9, so long as you do most of the provided content, you will have a breeze of a time, and no hitches. The boss of chapter 9 is where the issues start to arise, where I had to actually start grinding -- but available enemy groups gave little XP for the level I was at, and it was overall just a real slog to get my levels up. That's where a fair chunk of my playtime came from, as that took 32 hours across multiple days where I had the time to go grinding. Okay, so that done -- that was it, right? All good? Nah, it was a breeze up until Chapter 12 -- where it suddenly jumps the difficulty from your general level (Level 32-35 is what I've seen most at, at that stage), up to level 50, with two beefcake bosses that also dish out a friggin' BUTTLOAD of damage. At least this time they offer a battle arena with plenty of battles that dish out XP like scout cookies, and it made the grind a lot quicker! Only 12 hours, as opposed to 32, but that starts to show the issue -- levelling starts to require an inane amount of points, but the game is really stingy about handing that XP out unless you find very specific farming routines. This is where my fun started to fall apart, especially as I approached the final boss and was faced with the reality that I needed to grind again.

The biggest problem with this game, really is its climax. Any sense of satisfaction was taken away from me when I came to realise that the final boss has a conditional One-hit KO. One that favours targeting Kasuga, who, may I add, upon death, is an instant game over. This lead me to have to grind up my levels to a point where I can beat Mister Beefcake, Master of the OHKO, Tanker of All Damage, Owner of Almost All Resists, comfortably and stop his OHKO from actually being an OHKO. I don't know the statistics behind it, or what it's expecting, but it's a darn pain in the butt.

I really felt robbed of a fair chunk of my satisfaction, but even so, I recommend this game wholeheartedly. Just be ready to grind out a lot of stuff. Be ready to get annoyed at this game at spots, as it tells you ""you've not done enough yet!"" But even with all of those grievances, even with it being a slow burn at the start, this game is just a barrel of fun with an expertly written story. I didn't expect a lot of what had gone down in this story, and I'm glad I took my time to play it and enjoy it. Absolutely worth every cent, whether you buy it during a sale or at full price. Support RGG, show them we want more of this, because this was, and is an awesome experience. I'm sure I'll be replaying this with the Japanese VA soon."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"This game has saved my life.

I am 27 years old.

My ex wife and I have a daughter together and we adopted our son . They are both now 4 years old.

When we went through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. One day I got so angry at the spiral that was getting out of hand that I punched the cement in a moment of overflowing emotion. That caused me to break the fifth metacarpal in my right hand.... my working hand... my play hand... the hand I used to hold and carry my children to bed with. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to thrive.

After learning the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was on the verge of suicide. It should be noted that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man alive, with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of anger, nor have I ever been one to burst into tears, but I was at a low point that prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play one-handed while I recovered. Somehow I stumbled across this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a try.... I must admit that I didn't get through the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have only played a day or two. That said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope in life. I was able to let go of the pain and suffering that had been hanging over me. I was able to experience other people's joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes with this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand really hurt, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself, and I became the parent I needed to be at that moment, not the weak child I was.

Today I am very close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

I now have 3 children. My third son is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we stumbled into each other's lives unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year and are very happy together.

The moral of the story is that you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all the odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you,Hentai Mosaique Neko Waifus."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"I recommend it to:

-People who don't like JRPGs (vs Western RPGs) but want to find a JRPG they like.
-Similarly, people who are tired of the usual depiction of Japan in media. This game focusses more on the ""streets"" of Japan for lack of a better term, and the everyday people in them. The homeless, prostitutes, petty criminals, sleazy businessmen, etc...
-People who like Gintama, as the humour, setting and characters share many similar features, aesthetics and themes.
-Similarly, people who appreciate over the top and hammy combat as well as stories and situations (usually applies more to side content rather than the main story)
-People who are looking for a video game main character that isn't two googly eyes stuck on a potato. Ichiban is interesting, dynamic, likeable and in a few ways quite relatable.

"
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"7/10. Enjoyable, but I liked previous Yakuza games a bit more.

Strengths: Larger world than previous Yakuza games.
  good batch of mini games.
  equipment enhancement system gives a reason to grind.

Weaknesses: Combat feels more goofy than epic. Boss fights just aren't as intense as the rest of the franchise. Boss fights just break down to repeatedly doing the same thing over and over which gets real old real fast. Longer isn't better.
  Main story tries to adapt to having a 'party' but that just isn't consistent through the story. Side stories down right ignore the party except during any sort of fight. 

If you are looking to scratch the Yakuza itch, buy this. If you want wacky adventures in Japan's underbelly, buy this. If you want to punch guys and feel epic doing it ... replay a different Yakuza game."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,I still don't know how to play Mahjong.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Essence of the Orbital Laser+ I cried at the ending.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"While I still recommend Yakuza:Like a Dragon and it may interest some newcomers from the RPG crowd, I have to say that as a fan of the series, I feel underwhelmed. The story between mid-chapters to the finale stretch a lot. Too many obvious plot points being elaborated over, and over and over.  Major battles don't feel as epic as any of the past game because it is restricted by the battle system.

However, the game is still fun and its first chapters will manage to pull you in with its charms. The battle system is alright but IMO it needs to be less traditional and more inventive, to capture more of what we expect of the Yakuza series when it comes to epic and emotional battles.

On the technical side, the game runs very well on my PC and during my 100+ hours I experienced only one crash. I hope that SEGA continues this quality of publishing on their future PC ports."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,I'd die for Ichiban because I know he'd do the same
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Yes
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"Overall, I really enjoyed this game, it was my entry point into the Yakuza series. It's got lots of heart and humour.

 The turn-based battle system is entertaining  at the onset but can get a bit tedious, mainly due to big spikes in difficulty in the last 3/4 into the game that force you through dungeons to level up.  That said, the endearing cast (well voiced) and interesting (albeit somewhat predictable) story-line kept me going. The cities in the game are lovingly crafted and there are plenty of side quests and mini games to indulge in if that's your kind of thing. 

The game was also really polished (I didn't encounter any bugs) and it ran over 60 fps at 4K (RTX 3080) with no issues whatsoever.  Refreshing in these days of buggy, poorly optimised games.

Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,10/10 there's a chicken named Omelette who runs a restaurant.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,i wanna fuck the shit out of this game
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Everything about it is great. Only downside to this game is that there is no Shun Akiyama.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"I held off on getting this game for a while, I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy the turn based combat instead of the traditional beat em up. I'm glad I bought this game and I wish I had sooner. This has become my favorite of the franchise and one of the best games I've ever played. The story is incredible and filled with brilliantly written and acted characters. 

The protagonist, Ichiban, has quite the boots to fill now that we're not playing as Kiryu anymore. Ichiban is an amazing protagonist and without question does Kiryu justice. The emotional range is wider, and the positive outlook on everything that Ichiban invigorates sets him apart from Kiryu. They're both masterpieces of character development, writing and acting. 

The gameplay is incredibly fun and addicting. Leveling up your character as well as the Job you have set at any given time. Jobs are essentially specializations that incorporate different roles like healing, magic/melee, or even tanking. There's tons of loot, materials for crafting gear, and an enormous variety of enemy designs. Since the game has taken this turn into JRPG territory it's allowed more traditional aspects of other RPGs. There's dungeons, tons of bosses and minibosses, an endgame activity that's very difficult, and more. There's well over 100 hours worth of content here and it all improves you and your party's abilities. 

My complaints are negligible, there's sometimes too many enemies on the streets. That's pretty much it, Yakuza Like A Dragon is near perfect and a must play for anyone who's played the previous games and for anyone who wants to jump for the first time into this universe. Playing the previous games isn't necessary."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Unironically one of the best games i've played so far
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"Right, where do I start...

Yakuza: Like a Dragon (later in this review Yakuza 7) has been my introduction to the Yakuza franchise as a whole. Prior to this, all I knew about was the Bakamitai meme, which I also only knew as the Dame Da Ne song. I was a bit sceptical about getting into it at first, as I knew absolutely nothing about the game and franchise as a whole, and Brawlers weren't really my thing, but then I heard that this game features a different protagonist, and instead of a Brawler, plays as a turn based RPG. I had some money left over from Christmas, and I'm a big fan of the old Final Fantasy games, so I thought I might as well give it a try. Could always refund it if I didn't enjoy it. 

In Yakuza 7, you play as Ichiban Kasuga, a Yakuza grunt who goes to jail to cover for a higher-ranking member of the Arakawa family, which he belongs to. Thinking that this would make him climb the Yakuza ladder, and that his patriarch will honour and appreciate his cover, he comes back after 18 years of prison time to find out that everybody had abandoned him. Former police officer Koichi Adachi researched about the Tojo Clan and the Arakawa Family, attempts to convince Ichiban to come with him to Yokohama to stay safe, but Ichiban refuses. Ichiban finds his way back to his former patriarch and is then met with an unfortunate fate.

Oh boy, I was immediately hooked from the start. ""That's a lot of cutscenes for a game, it's like I'm watching a movie"" was my first thought. I liked story heavy games, but I felt a little overwhelmed on my first day, as out of the probably 5 or 6 hours that I was playing, 4 of them were just watching cutscenes. Now this might turn some people down, especially if they just want to enjoy the gameplay, but all the introductory scenes got me more invested in finding out about the presented characters and I didn't just want to stop playing until I found a point where I thought ""Okay, now the actual game finally begins.""

The vast majority of this game takes plays in the streets of Yokohama, more specifically, Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama's red light district. The world is incredibly detailed and you'll be pleasantly surprised to know that there's things hidden in every single corner. I really enjoy exploring in video games, trying to see if there's things hidden in places nobody would think of and-- to my surprise, they really thought of everything here. I try sneaking into a corner that I think might not even be intended to go to, and yet, there's something there for me to pick up. 

I personally went for the ""50% main story, 50% side story"" approach, which to me means - I'll do 2 or 3 side quests, of which there are plenty in Yakuza 7, and then I'll do a few story quests so that I can keep up with what is happening. And trust me, there's a lot of content to burn through. All of the sidequests are very well designed, and most of them got at least a little bit of a chuckle from me, so I'd like to think that they are quite humorous. Once done with the sidequests, I grabbed my imaginary bucket of popcorn and started getting immersed in the story. 

After I arrived in Yokohama, and the game properly begun for me, I thought to myself that this would be a silly little hero adventure. One of a redemption arc where Ichiban becomes the hero of a big and epic tale. Well, it's kinda like that, it starts off slow and adventurous, but the more the story goes on, Ichiban falls deeper into this crime drama rabbit hole. I will not spoil anything for the sake of letting you enjoy it by yourself, but I can say you're in for a treat. A big one. 

The gameplay itself is, as mentioned earlier, a turn based RPG. I hit you, then I wait, then you hit me, and then you wait. Yakuza 7 adds a nice little twist to that by adding small, simple QTEs to most of your abilities. Sometimes you might have to press a button repeatedly to give it more power, sometimes you might need to press the button at the proper time instead. Sometimes even both! It's a very, very simple thing but it keeps the combat entertaining, which is the main purpose. All attack animations look nice and polished too, some of the names and descriptions are silly and will put a weird look on your face when you first see it, but all skills feels nice to use. You might not have many skills when you first start the game, but the more you progress, the more and more skills will be added to your arsenal.

This game works in a job system, which you might be familiar with if you played some Final Fantasy games. While each character has their own primary main job, they can also switch to other jobs, which in this game are gender locked. Male characters can choose from a variety of different jobs, and female characters have their own jobs to choose from, too. Some of these jobs exist for both genders, although slightly altered, such as Host for males and Hostess for females. They essentially do the same thing, yet they slightly differ from one another.

Now, apart from the amazing story that this game has to offer, and the ability to throw ridiculous-looking skills at your enemies, there's also plenty of minigames that you can play in this game. Of course, there's Karaoke (also with Bakamitai!), Mahjong, Shogi and Dragon Kart (yes, like actual kart racing) just to name a few. Each of these felt well thought out and they're fun to do, and you can seriously get invested in them if you're dedicated enough. Sometimes I booted this game up just to play a little bit of Mahjong...

But there's probably a few negatives about this game, right? Yes there are, but in my personal opinion, these are just minor things that probably won't even bother you unless you think really hard about it. What I disliked during my playthrough is that there's just. so. many. random. encounters. I was told by a friend that this is common in the Yakuza games, and that you'll have to just deal with it, but god there's just so many. Happens a lot that you walk down one street and you get hit with 3 or 4 different encounters that really badly want to murder you. There is an item in this game that completely removes random encounters, but I feel like you'll get access to it way too late. By the time you have it, you're probably able to finish the game for good already. Another issue that I had in this game is that there was one dungeon that just felt way too long to complete. It wasn't even challenging or anything, you just entered a new floor and thought ""this is it"", only to be hit with a wave of disappointment as you realize this is just another floor with the same enemies as the last one. It was a slog to get through it, but luckily it's only a one time thing.

But even with all of those grievances, even with it being a slow burn at the start, this game is just a barrel of fun with an expertly written story. I didn't expect a lot of what had gone down in this story, and I'm glad I took my time to play it and enjoy it. Absolutely worth every cent, whether you buy it during a sale or at full price. Support RGG, show them we want more of this, because this was, and is an awesome experience. I'm sure I'll be replaying this with the Japanese VA soon."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"This game has saved my life.

I am 27 years old.

My ex wife and I have a daughter together and we adopted our son . They are both now 4 years old.

When we went through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. One day I got so angry at the spiral that was getting out of hand that I punched the cement in a moment of overflowing emotion. That caused me to break the fifth metacarpal in my right hand.... my working hand... my play hand... the hand I used to hold and carry my children to bed with. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to thrive.

After learning the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was on the verge of suicide. It should be noted that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man alive, with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of anger, nor have I ever been one to burst into tears, but I was at a low point that prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play one-handed while I recovered. Somehow I stumbled across this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a try.... I must admit that I didn't get through the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have only played a day or two. That said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope in life. I was able to let go of the pain and suffering that had been hanging over me. I was able to experience other people's joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes with this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand really hurt, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself, and I became the parent I needed to be at that moment, not the weak child I was.

Today I am very close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

I now have 3 children. My third son is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we stumbled into each other's lives unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year and are very happy together.

The moral of the story is that you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all the odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you,Hentai Mosaique Neko Waifus."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"I recommend it to:

-People who don't like JRPGs (vs Western RPGs) but want to find a JRPG they like.
-Similarly, people who are tired of the usual depiction of Japan in media. This game focusses more on the ""streets"" of Japan for lack of a better term, and the everyday people in them. The homeless, prostitutes, petty criminals, sleazy businessmen, etc...
-People who like Gintama, as the humour, setting and characters share many similar features, aesthetics and themes.
-Similarly, people who appreciate over the top and hammy combat as well as stories and situations (usually applies more to side content rather than the main story)
-People who are looking for a video game main character that isn't two googly eyes stuck on a potato. Ichiban is interesting, dynamic, likeable and in a few ways quite relatable.

"
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"7/10. Enjoyable, but I liked previous Yakuza games a bit more.

Strengths: Larger world than previous Yakuza games.
  good batch of mini games.
  equipment enhancement system gives a reason to grind.

Weaknesses: Combat feels more goofy than epic. Boss fights just aren't as intense as the rest of the franchise. Boss fights just break down to repeatedly doing the same thing over and over which gets real old real fast. Longer isn't better.
  Main story tries to adapt to having a 'party' but that just isn't consistent through the story. Side stories down right ignore the party except during any sort of fight. 

If you are looking to scratch the Yakuza itch, buy this. If you want wacky adventures in Japan's underbelly, buy this. If you want to punch guys and feel epic doing it ... replay a different Yakuza game."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,I still don't know how to play Mahjong.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Essence of the Orbital Laser+ I cried at the ending.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"While I still recommend Yakuza:Like a Dragon and it may interest some newcomers from the RPG crowd, I have to say that as a fan of the series, I feel underwhelmed. The story between mid-chapters to the finale stretch a lot. Too many obvious plot points being elaborated over, and over and over.  Major battles don't feel as epic as any of the past game because it is restricted by the battle system.

However, the game is still fun and its first chapters will manage to pull you in with its charms. The battle system is alright but IMO it needs to be less traditional and more inventive, to capture more of what we expect of the Yakuza series when it comes to epic and emotional battles.

On the technical side, the game runs very well on my PC and during my 100+ hours I experienced only one crash. I hope that SEGA continues this quality of publishing on their future PC ports."
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,I'd die for Ichiban because I know he'd do the same
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Yes
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"Overall, I really enjoyed this game, it was my entry point into the Yakuza series. It's got lots of heart and humour.

 The turn-based battle system is entertaining  at the onset but can get a bit tedious, mainly due to big spikes in difficulty in the last 3/4 into the game that force you through dungeons to level up.  That said, the endearing cast (well voiced) and interesting (albeit somewhat predictable) story-line kept me going. The cities in the game are lovingly crafted and there are plenty of side quests and mini games to indulge in if that's your kind of thing. 

The game was also really polished (I didn't encounter any bugs) and it ran over 60 fps at 4K (RTX 3080) with no issues whatsoever.  Refreshing in these days of buggy, poorly optimised games. 

"
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,10/10 there's a chicken named Omelette who runs a restaurant.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,i wanna fuck the shit out of this game
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,Local schizophrenic man goes on a mission to become a better person.
Yakuza: Like a Dragon,RPG,1235140,"The game is really slow to start off, so those of you used to the older Yakuza games might get turned off initially. I certainly wasn't sold on Y7 until past mid point. The changes to turn based combat did leave me a bit miffed, but I got over it. 

The story is certainly the strongest of the serie, after Y0 imo, but it does take a while to get the train going. Past villains often had one scene with not much characterization, but the great thing about Y7 is that everyone gets well developed, so there's a lot less plot holes compared to past games.

Ichiban can be a bit cringe at time with his power of friendship talks, but he does have a lot of charm to him nonetheless."

Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"[h1] Pros : [/h1]
(All the good stuff from the 2013 game is still here so i'm just going to copy the pros from my review of that game.)
+ Movements and controls are very fluid
+ Great combat system (you can play it stealthy but some missions forces you to go full on rambo mode)
+ A lot of ugradable skills and weapons
+ Parkour is great and fun
+ Puzzles are challenging
+ Open world with many things to explore and wander around
+ Great graphics and well optimized
+ Epic music that tells you sh*t's about to get down

[h1] Extra pros : [/h1]
+ Very fun fast-crafting mechanic for stealth and loud
+ A lot more variety of weapons to use
+ Better costumes
+ Story's not bad

[h1] Cons : [/h1]
- I've had some glitches here and there but it's not that bad
- Sometimes the assets doesn't load. (objectives, guards, etc.)
- Movements sometimes a bit glitchy and hard to control. (ledge jumping, etc.)

[b] Overall it's an amazing game with all the pros from its predecessor and some glitches.
Best adventure game i've played. [/b]

Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"First of all I have to say, Although it has been about 5 years since the production of this game, but we can still say with confidence that it is ahead of many new production games. 

Everything in this game is gathered like adventure - excitement. Thinking . Story and .... . 

 I emphasize again if you have not experienced this game for any reason. Do not hesitate and buy this game now.

Finally, I will mention some positive features of this game:

1- Lara croft's unique and lively design.
2- Beautiful artistic designs.
3- Attractive construction and upgrade system.
4- Appropriate story and characterization.
5- A glamorous world.
6- Return of temples and puzzles to their roots.
7- Low defect concealment system.
8- Very good artistic and technical graphics.

This game has definitely been one of my best purchases. I told you everything you needed to know. But the final decision is with you ...."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"I love this game so much.
So many improvements from the last game, and many fun activities and quests added."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"The Rise of the Tomb Raider serves as the sequel to the 2013 Tomb Raider remake, following events of Lara Croft's first expedition to Yamatai. While the second game does not necessarily need the first to understand the events and story that unfold, having played the first game provides a better understanding of Lara's character development and some references brought up from the first game from time to time.

The most appealing aspects and strong points of Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider series remake is its cinematic graphics, the details on Lara Croft's design (with this game displaying an even better definition than the first game), and the breathtaking landscapes creating the world in Lara's journeys. New features are also introduced to make the gameplay more interesting and interactive when solving challenges and surviving brutal terrains in accomplishing optional objectives or progressing with the story. The story itself is typical for a thrilling escapade to hidden worlds waiting to be discovered, one fit for a Lara Croft adventure.

The Rise of the Tomb Raider also includes the ""Croft Manor: Blood Ties"", which is a great addition to the game that gives more depth to Lara, her family history, and her background. It gives a sense of people from Lara's past you never knew, some of who you never even see, but from whom you can feel emotion in relaying experiences, thoughts, and events, to create a history all leading to Lara's destiny.

Rise of the Tomb Raider sees another fun and challenging adventure into a new unknown world, and becomes the defining moment where Lara fully embraces her family name and forges her own legacy as a Croft."
Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,I mix up all these Tomb Raider games in my head man. But I recommend them on sale. The third one has awesome graphics. I think this is the first or second one?

-Yes, yes, YES, WUAHAHAHA EVRYON LAIKKS COLECTABL :D

South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,RPG,213670,"South Park: The Stick of Truth is a Hilarious RPG that anyone can pick up and is easy after a few minutes of playing, It is definitely aimed toward a certain audience so if you find a talking shit and Nazi enemies up your alley in terms of jokes go for it. 
If you like the South Park tv show this game will definitely strike a chord with you with its humour and action.

you will not regret picking this game up as it can be found on sale and online for cheap."
South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,RPG,213670,"Coming back to the game after more than five years, I had forgotten how funny this was. It is difficult to say if the game, or its cartoonish predecessor, excelled at the no-holds-barred satire and dark humor where nothing is held sacred... especially for the game's protagonist, ""Douchebag"". (It should be noted that this game is [i]definitely [u]not[/u][/i] for kids, for obvious reasons.)

Aside from a couple of non-game breaking bugs, my only complaint is that this game is way too short. I would love it if the Obsidian developers would take a page from Postal II and expand the game to fill an entire week. For example, if the protagonist started his adventure on a Sunday, leaving the following days until Tuesday - why not create a few more DLCs to include Wed., Thurs., Fri. [i]and[/i] Saturday. This game would be worth it then to revisit with fresh content! 😍

Note: If you're playing for the achievements, you could probably do the majority in one playthrough - but with several reloads - and two for sure. It took me a total of three playthroughs to get all of the achievements, including those I earned years ago because I was casually playing back then."
South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,RPG,213670,It's Awesome.
South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,RPG,213670,"good game, good story line and the humour is just what you expect from southpark.
Only thing is: after finishing the game twice i noticed that i played the game just to get the achievement, not because i enjoyed it."
South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,RPG,213670,"If you're a fan of South Park, I highly recommend you get this game. There is a TON of South Park humor in this game, which is exactly what you want from this kind of game. The RPG elements are a bit limited, but not so limited that you feel like it's lacking. It just feels a bit dumbed-down, but that by no means makes the game bad. 

Anyone going for achievements, you can get 100% in one solid run. Might have to reload a couple times to different spots in the game to clean up loose ends but that is no big deal. Took me about 10 hours total. TIP: If you're trying to collect all the weapons and costumes, you do NOT need to have them all in your inventory at the same time. For some reason, not a single guide I read mentioned this. You just need to pick up the item one time and it will count towards your collection. This means you don't need to do unnecessary grinding for cash, simply collect everything until the end of the game, then sell everything to buy what you're missing. This also goes for items sold only in Canada. Simply sell items to the shops there and they will give Canadian currency. :)"
South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,RPG,213670,A bit glitchy when it comes to audio but other than that i love this game. the references are hilarious and well thought out. ive always loved the show its nice to play something where i feel like im apart of it. Overall id give this game a 9/10 it would be a 10/10 if there where no bugs in audio and very rarely combat but dont let that deter you. This game will have you playing and laughing for hours.

The Walking Dead,Adventure,207610,"Basically, it's a great story, and playing it is fun. The only downside I saw in the game was the limits of how much your choices really altered the story.

If you regularly play video games then you need to know what you are in for. It is an adventure game exclusively. No shooting (almost) or intense action, it mainly focuses on decisions using quick time events and dialogue options. It's extremely story-heavy, in fact, it is pretty much the only story using the aforementioned mechanics to drive it forward. You will hear people complain about how your choices don't matter but that isn't true. Your story will start and end the same way and you will follow the same general path but a lot of cool little things will change depending on your choices.

It's one of the few video games I've played where I've actually felt an emotional connection with the characters. I'd say it is definitely worth the 20 bucks!"

It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"[h1]What I liked: [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Heartfelt and charming story and world design
    [*]Insanely creative mechanics and levels
    [*]Pacing and overall design is top tier
    [*]Humor and Dr. Hakim
 [/list]
[h1]What I didn’t like: [/h1]
[list]
   [*] Human character parts are weak
 [/list]
[h1]My Score: [/h1]
[b]A++[/b]

[h1]Quick Summary [/h1]
As a champion for unique and creative games over anything, it’s a rare when one comes out and even rarer when it happens to be a CO-OP game. The amount of content could easily be split between 2 games. The levels, mechanics, world, humor, heartfelt and pure fun this game gives, makes me not care that it’s a casual baby game in terms of challenge that I slam other games for. Here it’s so non-gamers can take part in a once in a lifetime game that will be forever loved by all and sets a new bar for co-op design.

 [h1]More in depth: [/h1]
[list]
    [*]The STORY tackles divorce and the struggles of it with a child who is caught in the middle of it. The child part on execution is the weakest part of the whole game as she is very stiff and lifeless from both writing and voice acting, and was easily joked during my playtime. The trauma even though I couldn’t imagine having gone this this isn’t to be taken lightly, but most of the human scenes you can tell it’s a budget indie game, but it doesn’t affect the overall vibe. I care more about atmosphere and feel, not graphics. Luckily the human scenes are very few and are there to push the story forward and the ending scene has the emotional impact overriding the lower budget look.

    [*]Now it’s going to be all praise from here on. First the CHARACTERS especially the eyes of the dolls make them FEEL SO ALIVE and easy to get attached to their personalities. The book character, Dr. Hakim, along with his interactions with the main characters had so many humorous moments, with the fast edits punctuating the great pacing. There are some stereotypes of certain ethic groups and some played for laughs, and the fact that the wife works and the dad stays at home to some could be controversial but it’s not that bad. Also there are some scenes and what happens to justify it can be weird, laughable and horrific without spoiling, but the absurdity of it can make it comical, we all know what that scene is, a certain animal toy.

   [*]    Speaking of pacing, THIS GAME NEVER LINGERS ON ANYTHING TOO LONG WITH SOME BEING TOO SHORT. Platforming, boss fights, cutscenes. You literally can’t get annoyed because it will be moved past in a few minutes with big sections dedicated to exploring for stuff to interact with that is optional and there are a lot of these. You can sometimes feel like a kid in a sandbox and some rewards are just nice interactables and fun distractions and others are these minigames that range from childhood classic games, a few rigged games, some lackluster and my personal favorites being shuffle board and the racing ones, that add a neat little treat for those wanting  to compete. There are 25 minigames in total, which is insane, and even after 2 playthroughs I’ve missed 4 and one is a laser tennis that I need to play

    [*] The variety in this game has you going through just about anything that exists I think, without spoiling this aspect, this is a huge praise and hard to really describe and kind of melds into the BEST ASPECT OF THE GAME, CO-OP DESIGN. Now I don’t really go in depth that often at what makes a great co-op game as most people just want something to play with their friends and are mostly just tag along games in terms of design. Here this is objectively one of the greatest co-op designed games, first as you can’t play it alone so that’s a start, even if the game isn’t for you, you can’t argue why it’s great. 

    [*] Each level has both players given a UNIQUE GIMMICK THAT FORCES EACH TO PLAY TOGETHER to solve whatever is thrown at them, whether it’s simple like you shoot the goo that so that the other can explode, to opposite magnets, different weapons and gadgets that on their own can’t win and forces “collaboration” in terms of both gameplay and also for the story in ways that fit great. While leaning on the easy side when compared to harder puzzle or platforming co-op games. None can touch the creative, charm and variety this game has for the price and content delivered and will weirdly make you look at other co-op games in a new light and make them feel lackluster in terms of this co-op design perspective.

After playing [i]A Way Out[/i] last year, it was very refreshing to play a pure co-op experience since there's not much of that on the market currently, and it left an itch that nothing's come close to scratching. So, I guess it's a good thing that Josef Fares and the talented folks at Hazelight decided to release another pure co-op game that expands upon the foundation laid by [i]A Way Out[/i] called [i]It Takes Two.[/i] And I'm happy to report that [i]It Takes Two[/i] is an incredibly entertaining experience that is a significant improvement over its prison break predecessor that surprised me in more ways than one.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

While I think most people are going to compare this game's visual style to something out of a Pixar film, I would say this game feels a lot closer to something like [i]LittleBigPlanet.[/i] It's a delight, with so much variety in the environments considering that the story is basically contained to one house. The game also did an excellent job of not being too overwhelming with color, which on top of being paired with great character designs (especially in regards to the playable characters), made everything visually distinct enough that you could tell who was supposed to interact with what without getting in the way of the style that the game was going for. While I did play this game with slightly messy settings because I was streaming it, I could tell that this game is an absolute looker in terms of its style and environments, so the game absolutely succeeded in this regard.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

As I said before, [i]It Takes Two[/i] expands on basically all of the concepts laid by its predecessor. While it is still largely a puzzle platformer, one of the game's biggest strengths is in its variety, as it would switch up the genre very frequently. The parts of the game where I was witnessing my partner take on a boss structured like Street Fighter, or where we were tearing through a castle using fire and ice powers like a Diablo game were my absolute favorite parts. They didn't overstay their welcome, and were always a great way to change the pace as soon as the platforming/puzzle segments started to feel dull. Both characters had ample opportunities to shine, and I didn't feel like the power-ups were skewed in favor of one character at any point. While the game's on the easier side, I still found it incredibly engaging and didn't mind the difficulty since the game was meant to be accessible to as many people as possible. The boss fights were also very fun, and never felt mindless to beat since they all had different mechanics that felt like a proper assessment of your skills with whatever tool you're using. In terms of a pure co-op experience, this is arguably as good as it gets. It's balanced, engaging, and a constant delight from start to finish. I have nothing to negative to say here.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Where the gameplay was near perfect in execution, this game's biggest weakness is its story. The game tries to foreshadow a few things, (for example: [spoiler]Moon Baboon's parting words set him up to be an interesting recurring antagonist considering the players' intentions at that point in the game[/spoiler]) but ultimately get disregarded as soon as they move on to the next setting. I also feel like the game was too lighthearted tonally, and should've leaned more into its Pixar-esque appearance by suddenly changing the tone to something heavier in order to drive home the game's themes and sticking to that tone for more than one scene. While I did like the characters, and the game was genuinely pretty funny, I thought they were the only redeeming qualities in a story that felt like an excuse to throw the players into different situations, when it had plenty of potential to expand upon its themes using player interaction. The story is funny and entertaining, but its unwillingess to take itself seriously makes it disappointingly shallow overall.

[h1]Audio[/h1]

Not much to talk about here. The voice acting wasn't particularly remarkable, and there were a handful of moments that took me out of the game, but it wasn't noticeably bad. The music is also serviceable, though I'd say it is of a higher quality than the voice acting overall, outside of the final song which I found rather underwhelming. The sound design also works well enough, though again I'd say it's nothing to write home about. Overall, it's fine, though it's nothing I'll be talking about years from now. 

[h1]Content Value[/h1]

In terms of value, I'd say it's worth it at full price just for the reason that [b]you only need to buy one copy to play with a friend.[/b] But even then, I'd still say it's worth it simply because you'll remember your time with it because of how it constantly finds ways to reinvent itself. Sure, the story isn't anything to write home about, but it's still very memorable just for how good the gameplay is. You're not going to play it more than once most likely, but it's definitely fun enough to warrant doing another playthrough with someone else if you wanted to.

[h1]Overall[/h1]

[i]It Takes Two[/i] is an absolutely amazing co-op experience with a story that holds it back from being an all-time great. But even then, the story isn't going to significantly ruin your experience because the way the gameplay constantly finds ways to keep you engaged definitely makes up for this to a degree. If you have someone to play this with, it is absolutely worth your money just to help these types of short, story-driven co-op games become more commonplace. It's not the ""perfect co-op game"", but it comes quite close. I loved my time with this game and I cannot wait to see what Hazelight does next.

It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,origin client is the absolute worst
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"This game is beautiful. The graphics are amazing. The gameplay isa alot of fun and very engaging, The puzzles are mostly very easy but still fun to solve. The Dialoges and most of the carackter cast is pretty humoures to listen to and watch.

The 2 Player integration is really well made and if you play with your girl or boy, that makes it a time well spend together, letting the hours just vanish together. Also sound design, Worldbuilding, the details all around, the levels and and and... its simply beaufifully done and deserves just the bests of praise. 

well.... for the first 6-7 hours....
then suddenly, cody and amy decide like the psychopathic parents they are, to kill their daughters most loved toy... we laughed at the insane conclusion and laughed all the way to her play room.... and then, in a VERY TWISTED way... the two still go through with their plan.. AFTER getting a hug from cutie, after cutie asked then about their feelings and wanted to help them, after chaising her, while cutie was begging for mercy, after ripping out a leg, after dragging her slowly towards a cliff slowly, after listening to her pleads for felt hours, after a needle stapped into cuties ear, pining it to the ground... well... they didnt even pull the needle out, instead they just wanted to drag cutie further, ripping also the ear off... thats there we stopped playing, my girl sad, tears dropping down the chin, after SIX HOURS of fun and laughter... well done dude! 

who ever got the idea of for this scene in that game is a psychopath, the whole game was not in this mood at all up to this point, it was all fun and games and from yet to now it changed to psychopathic torture scene...

Amy: ""i am feeling quite evil doing this..."""
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,haha divorce
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"I don't think its an exaggeration to say this game is the best two player co-op game ever made.

Every level is so fun and unique, and the game is always giving you new abilities so it rarely feels dull.

Grab a friend and get this game. You won't regret it."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Play with a friend, lover or family to go trough multiple breathtaking environments and fun bosses. 
You maneuver your way trough the levels following an amazing story of a divorced couple.

I personally recommend this game."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Could be a spoiler, but doesn't really matter.










This game is about murderous couple slaying both living and humanized object just to make their one and only daughter cry.
Including mutilation of the daughter's favorite doll(living and talking) before murdering it.

Then they never looked back at their daughter until the end of the game. 

THE most psychopathic parents ever, under the brainwashing process of a Latino book who is forcing a relationship.

Very very horrible story line. Well, other than that, the storyline is intended to be heart-warming and it is.



The co-op playing experience was nice. Awesome game design too.

Easy for those who play action game regularly, a bit challenging to those who are not so familiar with aciton platformers.

If you have someone else to play with, go ahead and try it!

Play time is about ~11 hours."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,amazing and beautiful and content rich game! I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to have good time with their friend.
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Awesome cooperative game. Be prepared to work together.
Through the course of the 100% we only fought once."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"If only this game had come out 15 years ago, my parents might not have divorced."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Best game to get your purely hypothetical girlfriend into gaming.

Phrases that you normally never hear will leave her mouth:

""We make a great team!"",
""Can you nail me please?
or 
""Woah you're so big!""
"
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"It takes two, one of the most amazing games i've played by Hazelight Studios, i can imagine the amount of effort invested in this game, that said, investing in this game with only 30€ is a steal and you get a lot more than what's it worth. 

This game has a stunning level design, a good story line (not my cup of tea however, still very good).
Dr. Hakim appearance will trigger your anticipation as with his arrival, new game mechanics are always introduced.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
The visual design of all elements are wonderfully crafted.
The environments are imaginative and cleverly designed.

[h1] Bugs [/h1]
Only noticed one particular bug during the whole gameplay. As i was playing with friend, he was invisible on my side of the screen in the garden section.

[h1] Price [/h1]
Worth every penny.

[h1] Game time [/h1]
If all the puzzle are solved quickly then it will take about 10h during your first walkthrough. However, the average is set to 12-16h, so if you take in all the mini-games and take longer with puzzle solving.

[h1] Story [/h1]
It's pretty lovely to play with your partner, but if you're playing with your bro, it will still be pretty lovely, just consider that there's a 50% chance of you guys dating.

[h1] Grind [/h1]
From my experience, no grinding was involved.

[h1] PC requirements [/h1]
Honestly, this game is highly optimized, impressively so. So i'd say a carrot or a potato from the supermarket should get this going. All the jokes aside, check the PC requirements, they're not much.

[h1] Audience [/h1]
Honestly, i will want to point the target audience to all ages, however, i think i will be pointing it to adults, as i've never felt so bad about an elephant doll and a girls tears so much. Note: There's a whole bunch of references to other games and movies, like the lion king, a way out, Mario, +++.

[h1] Gameplay[/h1]
The variety introduced was a vital piece as it lead to the lack of repetivity in the game. So, VERY GOOD. In one game, i felt like a played soo many games.
As said, this coop game is worth EVERY PENNY.

[h1] Audio[/h1]
 Can go from good to eargasm!

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
I'd like to thank the developer and publishers for this wonderful game, the experience that was offered will most likely never be forgotten. I would like to congratulate everyone involved as this game was simple, ""AMAZING"".
Thank you very much (Except for the elephant, that wasn't cool)."

[h1]Quick Summary [/h1]
As a champion for unique and creative games over anything, it’s a rare when one comes out and even rarer when it happens to be a CO-OP game. The amount of content could easily be split between 2 games. The levels, mechanics, world, humor, heartfelt and pure fun this game gives, makes me not care that it’s a casual baby game in terms of challenge that I slam other games for. Here it’s so non-gamers can take part in a once in a lifetime game that will be forever loved by all and sets a new bar for co-op design.

 [h1]More in depth: [/h1]
[list]
    [*]The STORY tackles divorce and the struggles of it with a child who is caught in the middle of it. The child part on execution is the weakest part of the whole game as she is very stiff and lifeless from both writing and voice acting, and was easily joked during my playtime. The trauma even though I couldn’t imagine having gone this this isn’t to be taken lightly, but most of the human scenes you can tell it’s a budget indie game, but it doesn’t affect the overall vibe. I care more about atmosphere and feel, not graphics. Luckily the human scenes are very few and are there to push the story forward and the ending scene has the emotional impact overriding the lower budget look.

    [*]Now it’s going to be all praise from here on. First the CHARACTERS especially the eyes of the dolls make them FEEL SO ALIVE and easy to get attached to their personalities. The book character, Dr. Hakim, along with his interactions with the main characters had so many humorous moments, with the fast edits punctuating the great pacing. There are some stereotypes of certain ethic groups and some played for laughs, and the fact that the wife works and the dad stays at home to some could be controversial but it’s not that bad. Also there are some scenes and what happens to justify it can be weird, laughable and horrific without spoiling, but the absurdity of it can make it comical, we all know what that scene is, a certain animal toy.

   [*]    Speaking of pacing, THIS GAME NEVER LINGERS ON ANYTHING TOO LONG WITH SOME BEING TOO SHORT. Platforming, boss fights, cutscenes. You literally can’t get annoyed because it will be moved past in a few minutes with big sections dedicated to exploring for stuff to interact with that is optional and there are a lot of these. You can sometimes feel like a kid in a sandbox and some rewards are just nice interactables and fun distractions and others are these minigames that range from childhood classic games, a few rigged games, some lackluster and my personal favorites being shuffle board and the racing ones, that add a neat little treat for those wanting  to compete. There are 25 minigames in total, which is insane, and even after 2 playthroughs I’ve missed 4 and one is a laser tennis that I need to play

    [*] The variety in this game has you going through just about anything that exists I think, without spoiling this aspect, this is a huge praise and hard to really describe and kind of melds into the BEST ASPECT OF THE GAME, CO-OP DESIGN. Now I don’t really go in depth that often at what makes a great co-op game as most people just want something to play with their friends and are mostly just tag along games in terms of design. Here this is objectively one of the greatest co-op designed games, first as you can’t play it alone so that’s a start, even if the game isn’t for you, you can’t argue why it’s great. 

    [*] Each level has both players given a UNIQUE GIMMICK THAT FORCES EACH TO PLAY TOGETHER to solve whatever is thrown at them, whether it’s simple like you shoot the goo that so that the other can explode, to opposite magnets, different weapons and gadgets that on their own can’t win and forces “collaboration” in terms of both gameplay and also for the story in ways that fit great. While leaning on the easy side when compared to harder puzzle or platforming co-op games. None can touch the creative, charm and variety this game has for the price and content delivered and will weirdly make you look at other co-op games in a new light and make them feel lackluster in terms of this co-op design perspective.

After playing [i]A Way Out[/i] last year, it was very refreshing to play a pure co-op experience since there's not much of that on the market currently, and it left an itch that nothing's come close to scratching. So, I guess it's a good thing that Josef Fares and the talented folks at Hazelight decided to release another pure co-op game that expands upon the foundation laid by [i]A Way Out[/i] called [i]It Takes Two.[/i] And I'm happy to report that [i]It Takes Two[/i] is an incredibly entertaining experience that is a significant improvement over its prison break predecessor that surprised me in more ways than one.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

While I think most people are going to compare this game's visual style to something out of a Pixar film, I would say this game feels a lot closer to something like [i]LittleBigPlanet.[/i] It's a delight, with so much variety in the environments considering that the story is basically contained to one house. The game also did an excellent job of not being too overwhelming with color, which on top of being paired with great character designs (especially in regards to the playable characters), made everything visually distinct enough that you could tell who was supposed to interact with what without getting in the way of the style that the game was going for. While I did play this game with slightly messy settings because I was streaming it, I could tell that this game is an absolute looker in terms of its style and environments, so the game absolutely succeeded in this regard.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

As I said before, [i]It Takes Two[/i] expands on basically all of the concepts laid by its predecessor. While it is still largely a puzzle platformer, one of the game's biggest strengths is in its variety, as it would switch up the genre very frequently. The parts of the game where I was witnessing my partner take on a boss structured like Street Fighter, or where we were tearing through a castle using fire and ice powers like a Diablo game were my absolute favorite parts. They didn't overstay their welcome, and were always a great way to change the pace as soon as the platforming/puzzle segments started to feel dull. Both characters had ample opportunities to shine, and I didn't feel like the power-ups were skewed in favor of one character at any point. While the game's on the easier side, I still found it incredibly engaging and didn't mind the difficulty since the game was meant to be accessible to as many people as possible. The boss fights were also very fun, and never felt mindless to beat since they all had different mechanics that felt like a proper assessment of your skills with whatever tool you're using. In terms of a pure co-op experience, this is arguably as good as it gets. It's balanced, engaging, and a constant delight from start to finish. I have nothing to negative to say here.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Where the gameplay was near perfect in execution, this game's biggest weakness is its story. The game tries to foreshadow a few things, (for example: [spoiler]Moon Baboon's parting words set him up to be an interesting recurring antagonist considering the players' intentions at that point in the game[/spoiler]) but ultimately get disregarded as soon as they move on to the next setting. I also feel like the game was too lighthearted tonally, and should've leaned more into its Pixar-esque appearance by suddenly changing the tone to something heavier in order to drive home the game's themes and sticking to that tone for more than one scene. While I did like the characters, and the game was genuinely pretty funny, I thought they were the only redeeming qualities in a story that felt like an excuse to throw the players into different situations, when it had plenty of potential to expand upon its themes using player interaction. The story is funny and entertaining, but its unwillingess to take itself seriously makes it disappointingly shallow overall.

[h1]Audio[/h1]

Not much to talk about here. The voice acting wasn't particularly remarkable, and there were a handful of moments that took me out of the game, but it wasn't noticeably bad. The music is also serviceable, though I'd say it is of a higher quality than the voice acting overall, outside of the final song which I found rather underwhelming. The sound design also works well enough, though again I'd say it's nothing to write home about. Overall, it's fine, though it's nothing I'll be talking about years from now. 

[h1]Content Value[/h1]

In terms of value, I'd say it's worth it at full price just for the reason that [b]you only need to buy one copy to play with a friend.[/b] But even then, I'd still say it's worth it simply because you'll remember your time with it because of how it constantly finds ways to reinvent itself. Sure, the story isn't anything to write home about, but it's still very memorable just for how good the gameplay is. You're not going to play it more than once most likely, but it's definitely fun enough to warrant doing another playthrough with someone else if you wanted to.

[h1]Overall[/h1]

[i]It Takes Two[/i] is an absolutely amazing co-op experience with a story that holds it back from being an all-time great. But even then, the story isn't going to significantly ruin your experience because the way the gameplay constantly finds ways to keep you engaged definitely makes up for this to a degree. If you have someone to play this with, it is absolutely worth your money just to help these types of short, story-driven co-op games become more commonplace. It's not the ""perfect co-op game"", but it comes quite close. I loved my time with this game and I cannot wait to see what Hazelight does next.

It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,origin client is the absolute worst
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"This game is beautiful. The graphics are amazing. The gameplay isa alot of fun and very engaging, The puzzles are mostly very easy but still fun to solve. The Dialoges and most of the carackter cast is pretty humoures to listen to and watch.

The 2 Player integration is really well made and if you play with your girl or boy, that makes it a time well spend together, letting the hours just vanish together. Also sound design, Worldbuilding, the details all around, the levels and and and... its simply beaufifully done and deserves just the bests of praise. 

well.... for the first 6-7 hours....
then suddenly, cody and amy decide like the psychopathic parents they are, to kill their daughters most loved toy... we laughed at the insane conclusion and laughed all the way to her play room.... and then, in a VERY TWISTED way... the two still go through with their plan.. AFTER getting a hug from cutie, after cutie asked then about their feelings and wanted to help them, after chaising her, while cutie was begging for mercy, after ripping out a leg, after dragging her slowly towards a cliff slowly, after listening to her pleads for felt hours, after a needle stapped into cuties ear, pining it to the ground... well... they didnt even pull the needle out, instead they just wanted to drag cutie further, ripping also the ear off... thats there we stopped playing, my girl sad, tears dropping down the chin, after SIX HOURS of fun and laughter... well done dude! 

who ever got the idea of for this scene in that game is a psychopath, the whole game was not in this mood at all up to this point, it was all fun and games and from yet to now it changed to psychopathic torture scene...

Amy: ""i am feeling quite evil doing this..."""

It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"I don't think its an exaggeration to say this game is the best two player co-op game ever made.

I personally recommend this game."
It Takes Two,Adventure,1426210,"Could be a spoiler, but doesn't really matter.










This game is about murderous couple slaying both living and humanized object just to make their one and only daughter cry.
Including mutilation of the daughter's favorite doll(living and talking) before murdering it.

Then they never looked back at their daughter until the end of the game. 

THE most psychopathic parents ever, under the brainwashing process of a Latino book who is forcing a relationship.

Very very horrible story line. Well, other than that, the storyline is intended to be heart-warming and it is.



The co-op playing experience was nice. Awesome game design too.

Easy for those who play action game regularly, a bit challenging to those who are not so familiar with aciton platformers.

If you have someone else to play with, go ahead and try it!

Play time is about ~11 hours."

Dr. Hakim appearance will trigger your anticipation as with his arrival, new game mechanics are always introduced.

Only noticed one particular bug during the whole gameplay. As i was playing with friend, he was invisible on my side of the screen in the garden section.

[h1] Price [/h1]
Worth every penny.

[h1] Game time [/h1]
If all the puzzle are solved quickly then it will take about 10h during your first walkthrough. However, the average is set to 12-16h, so if you take in all the mini-games and take longer with puzzle solving.

[h1] Story [/h1]
It's pretty lovely to play with your partner, but if you're playing with your bro, it will still be pretty lovely, just consider that there's a 50% chance of you guys dating.

From my experience, no grinding was involved.

Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Vanilla game: 2/10, bland, empty, not too much content.

Modded game: fucking 10/10, incredible, so much potential for fun and exploration, building, RP, etc. 
The modding community for this game is unreal, one of the best modding communities I've ever seen for a game. Modded Starbound is the complete experience. 

I'd recommend Frackin' Universe + the related Frackin' mods if you're looking for good mods."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,its like terraria but not
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Terraria in space with mods, I love it."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Starbound overall is an absolutely fantastic game. The amount of content available in this game is incredible, and the game is still engaging after clocking 250+ hours. The random generation of planets, dungeons, and weapons keeps the game fresh, even after you have explored every system, planet, and moon in the universe. You never get to see everything, no matter how long you play the game for.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

   - Massive universe to explore, no matter how long you play, you will never explore it all.
   - Random generation creates fun and sometimes wacky planet types, every planet feels unique in its own right.
   - Super fun to play with friends, the adventure never ends.
   - This game is a builder's paradise. Paint, wiring, 100s of blocks to build with, let your creativity run free.
   - The music in Starbound fits absolutely perfectly. Curtis Schweitzer did an [b]incredible[/b] job with making the universe feel more lively and mysterious when it needs to be.
   - By far the most incredible part of this game is the [b]ATMOSPHERE[/b]. Some of the best moments in Starbound is when the atmosphere is just [i]right[/i]. Rainy nights in a small wooden house, standing by an ocean in the dead of night, some moments can give you the chills.

I praise Starbound for everything it has done right, but there are a few complaints I have with the game, though they are quite small and not game breaking.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

   - You may have heard this from other people before, but the optimisation is not the best. At some points, even on the best of PCs, the game will either freeze for a split second, enemies may stop attacking, and your character may not deal damage.
   - Another thing you may have heard before is the linear storyline. Yes, on your first playthrough this type of story is great, but after many playthroughs, it starts to feel annoying. The storyline isn't necessary for you to progress in terms of items, but helps to aid in terms of exploration. Heck, you can get top tier armour after the first mission.

Overall, Starbound is a game that you can really get stuck into once you complete it the first time. With random generation, plenty of items and cosmetics to collect and the ability to play with friends, Starbound is incredible in both singleplayer and multiplayer.

Overall, I give Starbound a 9/10."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"I. Love. This. Game.

The art style is absolutely beautiful. Coupled with the incredible amount of items you can collect is mind blowing.

This game alloys you to create an absolutely stunning amount of visually beautiful structures. The questline is cool, and the characters are actually really likeable! There are so many different things to collect too. From fossils, the fish, to little critters you might find on different planets with different atmospheres. Being able to terraform an entire planet and build it exactly the way you want to is just fantastic. Especially when you've been travelling the stars for weeks, only to head back on home to see where it all started.. 

You've also got a pretty cool wiring system you can play with too, to make lights turn on when you open doors, or path a rail with a cart on it, that can take you all over your world, with customisable junctions too! There are timer blocks and delay blocks as well. Wiring stuff up after you've created a structure is super fun.

The crafting in this game is forgiving too. Instead of what most games do: ""you need 5000 iron to craft this one block lol"", the recipes are super reasonable. but still challenging enough that you will still need to make recourse runs. The difficulty curve is exceptional too. Once you have started collecting iron, and upgrading your ship, armour, weapons ect, you'll have to head out of your cozy little start system, to another more hostile one, to find better ores. Travelling the stars is fantastic!

The music in this game is absolutely stunning. The theme song for this game is enough to bring a tear to your eye. This is an absolute GEM of a game, so i highly, HIGHLY recommend it. This game has brought me many memories with friends and my partner, that i will never, ever forget."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Starbound is a very fun game in the same art style as Terraria with similar controls and exploration ""gameplay loops."" While similar to Terraria in terms of how the player obtains loot and how monsters and the environment are generated, in SB you travel to different solar systems and planets with multiple biomes that feel like a mini-world from Terraria. The loot and monsters are RNG drawn from tables associated with the planet type (snow, desert, forest, jungle, volcanic, etc.) There are also some core missions that are tracked within the in-game log journal for easy reference, in direct contrast the often-inscrutable summoning requirements for some of Terraria's bosses. The game itself is very fun - exploring new worlds, finding equipment and cosmetic armor that range from neat space marine-type clothing to unicorn masks and pirate gear, or weapons like stun batons, rocket launchers, machine pistols, broadswords, or magic wands and staves.

All of the above would earn SB a ""Recommended"" here, HOWEVER, there is a persistent issue with regular, consistent lag spikes that has been known and not patched since at least 2017.

These lag spikes effect the player's orientation in the world against other objects, leading to many, MANY otherwise avoidable deaths due to long drops, enemy teleporting due to the latency catching up, and even falling off of platforms and rail systems that you set up for yourself - EVEN IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE WITH ALL MULTIPLAYER AND INTERNET CONNECTION TURNED OFF.

I can honestly say I enjoy each of the 29 seconds of gameplay between lag spikes much more than Starbound's closest cousin Terraria, but the lag has made playing on anything other than casual to be an exercise in frustration.

Do yourself a favor and watch a Let's Play or YT walkthrough for this game, enjoy seeing the neat monsters and sights and the Pokemon-style monster pod capturing, and then pat yourself on the back for saving yourself from spending $15 USD on a game that the developers once loved but then abandoned, unfinished, but left it on the Steam storefront for full price. 

If the lag issue is ever officially patched, then I would definitely recommend this game."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"game had a lot of potential, but was cut too short by lack of updates / meaningful progression / terrible story.

Starbound,Adventure,211820,"after playing this game for a week or 2 now. i feel i know what resonates with me about this game.

If I were in the mood to play a game of this kind, id go between 3. Minecraft, Terraria, and Starbound. each appeals to a different part of why i love these block-based games with exploration and such.

Minecraft is my go-to if I want to build, Terraria is for if I want a good combat and boss encounter. Starbound is for the Exploration and seeing what the world's gonna have. This game, with its varying worlds and randomly spawned in villages of each race and small mini dungeons and houses make this game feel super alive and vibrant. Minecraft and Terraria are about being the only one to colonize or truly try and experience things in your world. Here it feels like you are going out across a vast universe and finding groups everywhere, you aren't alone in this universe. You can make your own township, or ""colony"", on a world, travel around it and find a massive temple of Floran origin, and its amazing! my fondest memories so far are moments where I was just walking on a new planet, and finding these massive complexes stretching for ages underground when I wasn't even expecting to find it on this random desert planet I decided to land on to pick up a few pieces of Tungsten"

base building is booboo and the best materials you have to steal from other npc bases
matter manipulator upgrades feel like trash
think how much money this game wouldve made if they hired HOME or oddling to do the OST. 
i guess they had no budget? ive heard many people say the game was better in beta than it was now lmao


i was able to write better lore for this game than the actual writers and they're getting paid to do it. thats a big issue.

Now that I have your attention: look, the game is actually pretty okay, and I really do enjoy some of the aspects of it, but as someone who hasn't played it in years because 

1. The combat got stale within the first two days of playing it
2. The progression was hardly linear; it was so frustrating to find out what I should do if I really wanted to progress a certain plot or sideplot
3. I had more fun with roleplaying rather than the game itself

I should give you a very, very serious warning that is beyond any kind of personal interest: there's been some serious allegations within the last couple of years that claims the devs behind Chucklefish (at least a dozen) were completely unpaid for their work, not to mention there's been [i] at least one [/i] individual who was asked to do an incredible amount of work (i.e. the entire soundtrack) completely unpaid.

Side with whichever side you like, but I personally am NOT interested in that kind of corporate bullshittery. This is an indie company! This isn't some huge, triple-A project or studio that should even remotely have this kind of stupidity and exploitation happening."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,this game ruined my life

Starbound,Adventure,211820,"I got this game on sale because my friends were playing it. It's not terrible in concept, but it is just not original. All of the fun parts of this game have come from other sources. The small amount of lore is very cliche. But even beyond un-originality I have one major problem with this game.

The tutorial SUCKS. Like it is absolutely wretched - one of the worst I've ever seen.
First steps in the game are very scripted and super uninteresting. Once you finally get into the actual world, the tutorial pop-ups are mixed in with wordy lore, and they disappear, never to be seen again after 5 seconds, so if you miss it, it's gone forever.
I have had to read through stupid amounts of google just to figure out how to click a dang button I didn't even know existed, or to try a control option I swear I had tried before.

The crafting system is a slog because it requires lugging around like 10 different crafting stations, each with 3 or 4 different tabs, none of which are difficult to craft, and none of which gate off any real progression.

The trading prices are wretched. Like yeah resources are unlimited, but your stuff sells for nothing, and everything costs a ton - but far more egregious is the idea that 90% of your inventory actually doesn't have any value other than as cosmetic building blocks. The trees you chop down - the sand you mine, the cobblestone, it all has 0 value. You can mine thousands and get 0 of the common currency.

The combat is somewhat interesting, but very clunky.

If you want to pick this up to play with friends, have at, but be warned it's merely mediocre at best, and very cumbersome at its worst."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Vanilla game: 2/10, bland, empty, not too much content.

Modded game: fucking 10/10, incredible, so much potential for fun and exploration, building, RP, etc. 
The modding community for this game is unreal, one of the best modding communities I've ever seen for a game. Modded Starbound is the complete experience. 

I'd recommend Frackin' Universe + the related Frackin' mods if you're looking for good mods."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,its like terraria but not
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Terraria in space with mods, I love it."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Starbound overall is an absolutely fantastic game. The amount of content available in this game is incredible, and the game is still engaging after clocking 250+ hours. The random generation of planets, dungeons, and weapons keeps the game fresh, even after you have explored every system, planet, and moon in the universe. You never get to see everything, no matter how long you play the game for.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

   - Massive universe to explore, no matter how long you play, you will never explore it all.
   - Random generation creates fun and sometimes wacky planet types, every planet feels unique in its own right.
   - Super fun to play with friends, the adventure never ends.
   - This game is a builder's paradise. Paint, wiring, 100s of blocks to build with, let your creativity run free.
   - The music in Starbound fits absolutely perfectly. Curtis Schweitzer did an [b]incredible[/b] job with making the universe feel more lively and mysterious when it needs to be.
   - By far the most incredible part of this game is the [b]ATMOSPHERE[/b]. Some of the best moments in Starbound is when the atmosphere is just [i]right[/i]. Rainy nights in a small wooden house, standing by an ocean in the dead of night, some moments can give you the chills.

I praise Starbound for everything it has done right, but there are a few complaints I have with the game, though they are quite small and not game breaking.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

   - You may have heard this from other people before, but the optimisation is not the best. At some points, even on the best of PCs, the game will either freeze for a split second, enemies may stop attacking, and your character may not deal damage.
   - Another thing you may have heard before is the linear storyline. Yes, on your first playthrough this type of story is great, but after many playthroughs, it starts to feel annoying. The storyline isn't necessary for you to progress in terms of items, but helps to aid in terms of exploration. Heck, you can get top tier armour after the first mission.

Overall, Starbound is a game that you can really get stuck into once you complete it the first time. With random generation, plenty of items and cosmetics to collect and the ability to play with friends, Starbound is incredible in both singleplayer and multiplayer.

Overall, I give Starbound a 9/10."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"I. Love. This. Game.

The art style is absolutely beautiful. Coupled with the incredible amount of items you can collect is mind blowing.

This game alloys you to create an absolutely stunning amount of visually beautiful structures. The questline is cool, and the characters are actually really likeable! There are so many different things to collect too. From fossils, the fish, to little critters you might find on different planets with different atmospheres. Being able to terraform an entire planet and build it exactly the way you want to is just fantastic. Especially when you've been travelling the stars for weeks, only to head back on home to see where it all started.. 

You've also got a pretty cool wiring system you can play with too, to make lights turn on when you open doors, or path a rail with a cart on it, that can take you all over your world, with customisable junctions too! There are timer blocks and delay blocks as well. Wiring stuff up after you've created a structure is super fun.

The crafting in this game is forgiving too. Instead of what most games do: ""you need 5000 iron to craft this one block lol"", the recipes are super reasonable. but still challenging enough that you will still need to make recourse runs. The difficulty curve is exceptional too. Once you have started collecting iron, and upgrading your ship, armour, weapons ect, you'll have to head out of your cozy little start system, to another more hostile one, to find better ores. Travelling the stars is fantastic!

The music in this game is absolutely stunning. The theme song for this game is enough to bring a tear to your eye. This is an absolute GEM of a game, so i highly, HIGHLY recommend it. This game has brought me many memories with friends and my partner, that i will never, ever forget."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"Starbound is a very fun game in the same art style as Terraria with similar controls and exploration ""gameplay loops."" While similar to Terraria in terms of how the player obtains loot and how monsters and the environment are generated, in SB you travel to different solar systems and planets with multiple biomes that feel like a mini-world from Terraria. The loot and monsters are RNG drawn from tables associated with the planet type (snow, desert, forest, jungle, volcanic, etc.) There are also some core missions that are tracked within the in-game log journal for easy reference, in direct contrast the often-inscrutable summoning requirements for some of Terraria's bosses. The game itself is very fun - exploring new worlds, finding equipment and cosmetic armor that range from neat space marine-type clothing to unicorn masks and pirate gear, or weapons like stun batons, rocket launchers, machine pistols, broadswords, or magic wands and staves.

All of the above would earn SB a ""Recommended"" here, HOWEVER, there is a persistent issue with regular, consistent lag spikes that has been known and not patched since at least 2017.

These lag spikes effect the player's orientation in the world against other objects, leading to many, MANY otherwise avoidable deaths due to long drops, enemy teleporting due to the latency catching up, and even falling off of platforms and rail systems that you set up for yourself - EVEN IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE WITH ALL MULTIPLAYER AND INTERNET CONNECTION TURNED OFF.

I can honestly say I enjoy each of the 29 seconds of gameplay between lag spikes much more than Starbound's closest cousin Terraria, but the lag has made playing on anything other than casual to be an exercise in frustration.

Do yourself a favor and watch a Let's Play or YT walkthrough for this game, enjoy seeing the neat monsters and sights and the Pokemon-style monster pod capturing, and then pat yourself on the back for saving yourself from spending $15 USD on a game that the developers once loved but then abandoned, unfinished, but left it on the Steam storefront for full price. 

If the lag issue is ever officially patched, then I would definitely recommend this game."
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"game had a lot of potential, but was cut too short by lack of updates / meaningful progression / terrible story.

you can get hooked on the progression, but the different progression systems feel disjoint and meaningless, and stop abruptly without much impact. 

it feels hollow, but at least the music is good. 

"
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"The base game is quite fun with its humor, base building and exploration, has a pretty good story to go along with the building and progression in which it can guide you through to end game.

Starbound,Adventure,211820,"This game might be a lot of fun. I will never find out. Because these wonky controls are driving me mad and kill all the fun that might be in this game. I just don't get how one can make such a bad design choice - ignoring the well established and millions-of-times-proofed-working-perfectly-fine Minecraft inventory system. Why on all god sakes names should someone decide to replace this one by something so irritating? Turning a nobrainer into a frustrating, never-ending challenge? I just don't get it..."

Starbound,Adventure,211820,an amazing story and gameplay much like terraria but with more content
Starbound,Adventure,211820,"after playing this game for a week or 2 now. i feel i know what resonates with me about this game.

If I were in the mood to play a game of this kind, id go between 3. Minecraft, Terraria, and Starbound. each appeals to a different part of why i love these block-based games with exploration and such.

Minecraft is my go-to if I want to build, Terraria is for if I want a good combat and boss encounter. Starbound is for the Exploration and seeing what the world's gonna have. This game, with its varying worlds and randomly spawned in villages of each race and small mini dungeons and houses make this game feel super alive and vibrant. Minecraft and Terraria are about being the only one to colonize or truly try and experience things in your world. Here it feels like you are going out across a vast universe and finding groups everywhere, you aren't alone in this universe. You can make your own township, or ""colony"", on a world, travel around it and find a massive temple of Floran origin, and its amazing! my fondest memories so far are moments where I was just walking on a new planet, and finding these massive complexes stretching for ages underground when I wasn't even expecting to find it on this random desert planet I decided to land on to pick up a few pieces of Tungsten"

all planets feel the same, this game needs better textures badly

should have a leveling system, not just random armor stat buffs that dont allow you to have a build
the devs for this game are absolute shitheads. they have no idea what they are doing
all the letsplays for this game are sickening furry orgies
multiplayer is a pain in the ass.
you HAVE to get lucky enough to find a teleporter core if you even want to TRY to make a base

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,"INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE
Introduction

1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.

3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.

4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.

5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important."

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,It just works
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,"In short, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim captures so many of the finest gaming experiences I've ever had.  So much so...that it's my favorite video game of all time.  Why?  

<big inhale>

So I've been a gamer since the Atari 2600 days and have always been fascinated with those 'senses of wonder' video games typically offer.  Perhaps its because of the addictive nature of sheer discovery as we press ever deeper into what a game has on tap.  I'm not necessarily into fast-twitch types of games, mind you (except for the original Marble Madness...that was ahead of its time), but deep story-driven games that give you freedom to role-play without tons of linearity are my ultimate cup of tea.  I'm an exploration nut, so I really love to go wherever I want to, whenever I want to, and however I want to...simply to seek out spots where it [i]feels[/i] like I'm just not supposed to be there and be rewarded for it.  The first game ever for me that offered up that kind of experience was the original Legend of Zelda on NES.  When I opened that well-earned (savings from cutting people's grass) golden cartridge for the first time, I had no idea what I was in for (there was no YouTube or anything like that...only word of mouth from friends who either had it or had read about it in Nintendo Power magazine).  For that game, I had neither.  I went into it [b]cold[/b].  And it was amazing.

Fast forward significantly from there, and I've mowed through so many great gaming experiences that are just too many to recount.  But...with all those great gaming moments I so thoroughly enjoyed...in the back of my mind, none had compared to the magnitude of grandeur that the Legend Of Zelda (and its subsequent follow-ups up through Ocarina of Time) gave me.  For me, those were true pinnacles for an exploration nut like me.  However, I noticed that though I did enjoy Ocarina of Time a lot, it felt like the franchise wasn't aging with me (becoming too 'kiddy"" for lack of a better term).  In other words, it was clearly targeted to a younger age group than that of my own.  My outlook changed, and I realized then that perhaps what I loved about the series was based primarily on the nostalgia I tried to keep internally encapsulated.  The series went another direction, leaving me bittersweetly behind.  I wasn't mad about it...just accepting of the fact that the magic I enjoyed of those games was becoming more distant.  And no, I didn't become full of woeful anguish, jamming R.E.M.'s ""Losing My Religion"" and all that.

So around May of 2012, a work colleague of mine and I began to talk about our respective plans for the soon-approaching weekend just before parting ways.  In that conversation, I asked him, ""So what are you guys doing this weekend?""  I'll never forget his answer; ""I am going to get a bucket of KFC and some Mountain Dew, strip down to my boxers for the entire weekend, fart, and play 'Sskyrim.'""  I laughed my ass off and was taken aback [b]quite[/b], then I responded with, ""Sounds like a firm plan you've got there, and might I ask what the hell 'Sskyrim' is...is that a video game?""  He said,""Oh yeah...it's THE video game.""  You may be laughing, but during this particular time, you can indeed say I was living under a rock to not know about Skyrim (even Elder Scrolls in general...I know), and you'd be right to say so.  Anyway, I started asking about what was so good about this 'Sskyrim' to warrant this interesting resolve for the weekend that completely seemed to give no purchase to any other potential plans.  So then he started telling me about it...followed by me asking more questions, as my interest was admittedly and increasingly piqued.  He then began to pull up some videos on his phone, showing me the first moments of the game's intro.  I was floored by 'this-game-I've-never-heard-of's' opener.  The setup in that short teaser had me ready to go buy this game at that moment from the nearby Wal-Mart, but not before my work colleague described to me his first account of stepping out into the land of Skyrim from the dark breaches of Helgen Keep, as that Skyrim sun bathed his weary eyes, having so nearly succumbed to the darknesses just endured, in a golden splendor.  I was sold.  Period.

Enter The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim...

3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.

4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.

5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important."

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,RPG,489830,"In short, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim captures so many of the finest gaming experiences I've ever had.  So much so...that it's my favorite video game of all time.  Why?  

<big inhale>

So I've been a gamer since the Atari 2600 days and have always been fascinated with those 'senses of wonder' video games typically offer.  Perhaps its because of the addictive nature of sheer discovery as we press ever deeper into what a game has on tap.  I'm not necessarily into fast-twitch types of games, mind you (except for the original Marble Madness...that was ahead of its time), but deep story-driven games that give you freedom to role-play without tons of linearity are my ultimate cup of tea.  I'm an exploration nut, so I really love to go wherever I want to, whenever I want to, and however I want to...simply to seek out spots where it [i]feels[/i] like I'm just not supposed to be there and be rewarded for it.  The first game ever for me that offered up that kind of experience was the original Legend of Zelda on NES.  When I opened that well-earned (savings from cutting people's grass) golden cartridge for the first time, I had no idea what I was in for (there was no YouTube or anything like that...only word of mouth from friends who either had it or had read about it in Nintendo Power magazine).  For that game, I had neither.  I went into it [b]cold[/b].  And it was amazing.

Fast forward significantly from there, and I've mowed through so many great gaming experiences that are just too many to recount.  But...with all those great gaming moments I so thoroughly enjoyed...in the back of my mind, none had compared to the magnitude of grandeur that the Legend Of Zelda (and its subsequent follow-ups up through Ocarina of Time) gave me.  For me, those were true pinnacles for an exploration nut like me.  However, I noticed that though I did enjoy Ocarina of Time a lot, it felt like the franchise wasn't aging with me (becoming too 'kiddy"" for lack of a better term).  In other words, it was clearly targeted to a younger age group than that of my own.  My outlook changed, and I realized then that perhaps what I loved about the series was based primarily on the nostalgia I tried to keep internally encapsulated.  The series went another direction, leaving me bittersweetly behind.  I wasn't mad about it...just accepting of the fact that the magic I enjoyed of those games was becoming more distant.  And no, I didn't become full of woeful anguish, jamming R.E.M.'s ""Losing My Religion"" and all that.

So around May of 2012, a work colleague of mine and I began to talk about our respective plans for the soon-approaching weekend just before parting ways.  In that conversation, I asked him, ""So what are you guys doing this weekend?""  I'll never forget his answer; ""I am going to get a bucket of KFC and some Mountain Dew, strip down to my boxers for the entire weekend, fart, and play 'Sskyrim.'""  I laughed my ass off and was taken aback [b]quite[/b], then I responded with, ""Sounds like a firm plan you've got there, and might I ask what the hell 'Sskyrim' is...is that a video game?""  He said,""Oh yeah...it's THE video game.""  You may be laughing, but during this particular time, you can indeed say I was living under a rock to not know about Skyrim (even Elder Scrolls in general...I know), and you'd be right to say so.  Anyway, I started asking about what was so good about this 'Sskyrim' to warrant this interesting resolve for the weekend that completely seemed to give no purchase to any other potential plans.  So then he started telling me about it...followed by me asking more questions, as my interest was admittedly and increasingly piqued.  He then began to pull up some videos on his phone, showing me the first moments of the game's intro.  I was floored by 'this-game-I've-never-heard-of's' opener.  The setup in that short teaser had me ready to go buy this game at that moment from the nearby Wal-Mart, but not before my work colleague described to me his first account of stepping out into the land of Skyrim from the dark breaches of Helgen Keep, as that Skyrim sun bathed his weary eyes, having so nearly succumbed to the darknesses just endured, in a golden splendor.  I was sold.  Period.

Enter The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim...

A short game narrate unique creepy plot with so cruel, depressed atmosphere and greatfull soundtrack. Gameplay is pretty simple: run, hide, crawl and cross the puzzles. Here's clear that the developers put heart into their creation and I believe we'll see continuation little nightmares."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,I'm just gonna copy paste my Little Nightmares 1 review because it still fits it. Does a fantastic job scaring the crap out of you with no (big) in your face jumpscares. The game makes you feel really uncomfortable in a very pleasant way. I would definitely recommend this game for some one that wants to play a horror game but really hates getting scared. I mean I was able to play through the whole game.
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Creepy, disturbing, beautiful!"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Up all night playing this game, strongly recommend."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,Good Game.
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,This game is fun and scary. I played this game after midnight and it made the experience phenomenal that I had to sleep with the lights on. I got it for sale for the price of $29.99 (Deluxe Edition).
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,i almost wet my self playing it  but it was a great adventure
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Great game! I played it with friends who aren't gamers and it was easy enough for them to play (i took over for the hard, scary bits). Definitely will play through again on my own and would recommend. Interesting story and surprising ending!"
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"This is even better than the 1st LN and I didn't think that was possible. Amazing game, and would probably be easier with a controller. Trying to pass the mannequins using a keyboard isn't great."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,wew.
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"I want to like this game I really do. The aesthetics are beautifuly creepy. The character designs and sense of fear in some areas are fantastic. But the controls and frustratingly annoying gameplay hold this game back from being something I can enjoy. 

The room with the dozen mannequins was the tipping point. Being the additional axis and the wonky camera, makes that area the sole reason I went from a neutral to a negative review. Don't get this at full price, because it is not worth it."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"I loved this game as much as i loved the first one. It's creepy in a magnificent and unique way.
The only downside is it's price. In 8,4hrs i completed 2 full playthroughs. One for experiencing the story and one for gathering any remaining collectibles and achievements. I find a 30$ price tag for a ~5hrs game a bit too much for my taste.
So although i would recommend it, i would also recommend to wait for a discount before purchasing."
Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,"Puzzles are really good, the music and atmosphere really hit you and shake you up hard (in the positive way of course). The new adults(?) are super creepy and disturbing as hell, so that means they are hella good. I say get this game. 5/5"

Little Nightmares II,Adventure,860510,good game

Human: Fall Flat,Adventure,477160,"""Human: Fall Flat"" is a well-done, fun game.  It's especially fun when played co-op (watching your friends thrash around is hilarious).  My complaints about it are minor:

- Even though the game is predicated on moving floppy bodies around with loose controls, many of the optional paths, areas or Achievements need fairly tight control.  In general, though, because of the ensuing hilarity, this is fine.

- The ability to climb walls would be nice.  From what I've read, this was removed from the game for being overpowered.  Looking at a lot of the speedrun videos on YouTube, I've got to agree with that.  But, having the ability to just use our chins or something to edge us up that last inch or two of a slightly botched jump would be great.

- I don't know if this was a generic connection issue or something with the game, but in co-op, we experienced quite a few momentary freezes.  It's more than a stutter.  The game appears to just stop for 5 or so seconds at a time.  Unfortunately, when it happens, things are still  happening in the game and when things un-freeze, you can find yourself in a less than stellar situation.

And that's pretty much it.  Just a few minor issues with a great game.  It took me 46.7 hours to complete it with 100% Achievements (though that was with a lot of repeat co-op play -- a more focused approach would be significantly faster).  So, it's worth it even at its list price of nearly $20 (though it historically goes on sale for between $6 and $7.50 quite often).  Recommended."

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you Behemoth."

Thank you Behemoth."

Half-Life,Adventure,70,"Half-Life is definitely a game-changing FPS, inspired by the classics but also genre-breaking. The levels are linear but it follows a coherent story, there's puzzles to solve outside of the shooting - sometimes optional to get some ammos and/or health but usually they are actually needed to continue onto the next area or level!

So gameplay-wise it's your standard FPS. You have a full set of various weapons - everything from a regular 9mm to an RPG. There's also some experimental weapons you get later on. The enemies are... I'd say kinda hard. Health is generated by either health packs or health stations, so no re-gen here. Ammo are in certain areas scarce and there's several enemy types that are bullet sponges, especially later on in the game.

Has it aged well? I don't know, it's playable but at the same time it's quite rough around the edges. Perhaps Black Mesa is the better version these days?

It's overall good tho and I had a fun time with it, although I do have to admit that in certain areas... I had to ""turn off"" my health. It was a bit too hard for my taste otherwise and I had no real interest in re-playing certain areas over and over."
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"[h1] An experiment that cost humanity everything[/h1]
[b]Half-Life[/b] is one of the best games ever made by man. A game with a huge universe, which is much deeper than it might seem at first glance. This is not just a shooter. And this is not just a story about one late-come scientist wearing distinctive glasses. The Black Mesa incident is just a prelude to what humanity will have to face in a matter of days. And Gordon's journey through the entire complex is just one of many destinies that are being decided right here and now. And Freeman is clearly not the kind of person who gives up in the erupting nightmare, where your next step can be the last. And the story of Gordon Freeman is an example that there are no impassable obstacles, no matter how insurmountable they seemed. A simple scientist with a crowbar in his hands and wearing an H.E.V 4th model protective suit with a basic military expertise. What this particular person could achieve by the end of this longest day of his life? But he achieved a lot. He survived in this seething hell from unseen before aliens and exactly the same people but in a soldier's uniform, who came here with one goal - to clear the complex. Literally. Including him. Against the background of Gordon's survival, we see the fate of other people - not only the same scientists, security officers, but also the soldiers, the very ones who came to ""cleanse"" us. Half-Life is, first of all, the tragic story of the fate of many hundreds of people who became the first, but far from the last victims of this criminal experiment, whose result was known for a long time to that very man in a business suit and administrator Breen. In 48 hours the history of the complex will come to an end. Towards the end, which will be the beginning of an even greater nightmare that will befall the entire planet and its population. Most of the Black Mesa personnel will die, as will many of those who were sent to clean it up. But those who survive will devote the rest of their lives to trying to turn things around. After all, from the waste of Portal Storms, a force will come, which will open a new chapter in the history of the Earth. The darkest and bloodiest."

Half-Life,Adventure,70,"Good morning and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit System. This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of the Black Mesa Research Facility personnel. The time is 08:47 AM. Current topside temperature is 93 degrees, with an estimated high of one hundred and five. The Black Mesa compound is maintained at a pleasant 68 degrees at all times.

Half-Life,Adventure,70,"OK, Half Life is from 1998, so it's pretty old - I'll try to keep that in mind when writing this review.

It's not brilliant, I'll be honest. The sound design is the same loop and when other sounds are playing,it becomes a horrible cacophony of noise. If you like tinnitus - this is perfect for you. 

The graphics are old, yet very good even today. They really do set the mood of the whole game. The enemy design is also brilliant, every enemy is very different from the other and so you always have to learn how to counter every new enemy. 

In combat, things fall apart. You are always the weaker enemy, which is partly the point, and bullets are scarce so really count if you don't want to take loads of damage. Combat is, however, the dominant feature, and you have to fight endless enemies that you have already met. It becomes almost a chore towards the end of the game, and it spoiled the experience for me. 

Half Life is a long game. It took me about 15 hours to beat the game on my first playthrough (on normal difficulty). At times there were long parts (one up to 2 hours) that felt like fillers and that didn't need to be there. There were puzzles that gave you no help to solve so you're stuck trying to solve the puzzle until you randomly get to the answer. 

It's not the best game ever, it's old and I got really motion sick at times. The thing that made this game enjoyable for me is the moments that aren't bad. If you stick with the game, there's so much it does right and these moments really make the game enjoyable and massively outweigh the negatives in Half Life.

Overall, I'd probably give this game a 5/10 - not the best, but not by far the worst I've ever played either."
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"Now if you have the choice between Black Mesa and Half-Life definitely choose Black Mesa as it is a more modern remastered version of this game that fixes most the bugs. Half-Life isn't a bad game by any means  and is still a great game to this day however in my opinion it hasn't aged that well with it's slippery physics, enemy placement, damage dealt vs damage received, bland soundtrack, etc. I will say that if you want to check out some gaming history this is a great game to play but if you just want to have great time while playing the first chapter of Gordon Freeman's adventure then I would heavily advise choosing Black Mesa."
Half-Life,Adventure,70,"Despite still being old, it's such a good game. The existence of this proves you don't need good or realistic visuals to have the time of your life."

Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"I'm not an AC fan, so I don't give a crap that this isn't a traditional AC game. I just wanted to play as an Ancient Greek warrior, and that's what I got"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"I went into this game without the mindset of [b]""it's an Assassin's Creed game, therefore it must be like every Assassin's Creed game prior and it has to have hidden blades, assassins and the templar order because it's an ASSASSIN'S CREED game!""[/b] and it feels ABSOLUTELY great! I fail to understand how people hate Odyssey for what it is, because what it is is genuinely fantastic. I think everyone should dedicate enough time towards exploring the Ancient Greek world and truly experiencing it.

The main element of ""Assassin's Creed"" is still there, it's just utilised in a different form to its predecessors.

Given the chance, Assassin's Creed Odyssey has the potential to very swiftly become anyone's all time favourite. This game has enough content to keep an average completionist playing for a hundred hours and then some!

In my opinion, people who hate the new instalments are those who have grown too accustomed to what this franchise used to be. [i]It's time to move on.[/i]"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,very many good
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"I’ve played almost every AC game in existence. From the Ezio trilogy to this. And while it’s true that this is only an AC game by name, that doesn’t mean the game is bad. I’ve played 122 hours of this game and had lots of fun with it. From the surprisingly good gameplay to the funny conversations. THIS is what I call a good open world game.

[h1]STORY:[/h1]
You play as a mercenary in Greece during the Pelponesian war. And from then on, you find out about a secret organization that’s plotting to take over Greece. So of course it’s your job to stop them by teeming up with familiar faces and taking them out. The story has some twist and turns which caught me off guard most of the time. Although the final act seems a bit weak if you ask me. Nevertheless, it’s still good and funny sometimes lol. 

You also have dialogue choices that do have consequences. It’s not as deep as some other games but it does its job.

[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]
The graphics of this game look great, but the optimization is terrible. I played this game on an i7 6700k. Most of the time my CPU went to 100% usage and was between 80-95%. Really wished Ubisoft fixed it. Otherwise, the game is detailed and pretty to look at.

[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]
The combat in this game is superb. The number of weapons and abilities you can use is astounding. From swords to spears to hammers. This game has it all. You can mix and match between abilities to give you some sick builds. You want to be a tank that outputs massive damage? Go on ahead. A glass cannon that’s fast and nimble? No problemo. 

The quests are great. You’ve got legendary beasts quests where you fight monsters, Naval quests and the usual quests. Surprised that I wasn’t bored from them lol. 

I’ve heard from a lot of people that the games is grindy and that you need to buy time savers in order to have fun. WRONG. If you play the game like you would any open world RPG, you’d see the opposite. I was over-leveled by the end because I played the game as intended: By doing side quests and exploring. Don’t listen to those who tell you otherwise.

[h1]VERDICT:[/h1]
While AC: Odyssey isn’t the typical AC game we’ve known and love. It’s still an amazing game that’s fun to explore. Combat is amazing, story is decent, and overall the game deserves to be played as long as your specs are good.

I RECOMMEND.
"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"Best assasins creed, probably should have a different name."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"After putting in some decent hours I must say this game is fantastic. There is a lot to do here, The campaign is quite lengthy and has many tasks that have to be done, so there is no shortage of stuff to do there. Although, some of the side missions are pretty much copy and pastes of each other, and the cities aren't exactly %100 unique, (you can definitely see some repetition in the smaller countries) it is still absolutely gorgeous in this game, and if your PC can handle it ultra high settings is a dream come true here. However, regardless of that fact I've done more side missions and bounties than I can count and haven't been bored yet, so that says something. I've never played any other assassins creeds before this one so I can't compare, but as a no-bias, first time experience, this game satisfies all of my needs. I %110 recommend this game to anybody who's contemplating purchasing it, it is without a doubt worth every penny."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,Pretty awesome game though I wish it was more optimized for pc.
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"My first day of playing Odyssey was great, just shy 8hrs of gameplay with zero issues. The next day I logged on and I have been consistently getting the same auto close issue where Ubisoft Connect needs to properly save and upload. So, I went offline on Ubisoft Connect and have had zero luck playing longer than 5-10mins at a time before it randomly out of nowhere auto closes the game again."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,fun
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,Best AC !
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"Pros:  
-Nice looking game
-Nice setting

Cons: 
-Most characters and quests feel shallow and uninteresting - quantity rather than quality
-It seems like every quest you get turns into 3 others, making the game a chore to get through
-Enemies are sponges in combat, they mostly scale to your level too, so they stay spongy 
-Missing the elements of an AC game, missing the elements of a good RPG

Just buy an older AC game (not origins) for an AC experience, or Witcher 3 for a good RPG; get this on sale if you want to play for the setting.

"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"This is easily my favorite entry into the series. Kassandra was an extremely likeable main character for me. The gameplay took the best parts of Origins and polished them. Loved the mercenary mechanic. This was also the game that handled the First Civilization storyline to the best degree, in my opinion. Maybe it was because with the rest of the game dealing in ancient greek culture, there was less of an immersion break when doing the Elysium/Underworld/Atlantis DLC. 

I think what really sets this game apart from the others in the series though, is the comedic writing. I liked Origins for Bayek and Aya, and for all of the ancient Egyptian history and culture it portrayed. But I adore Odyssey for it's commitment to poke fun at itself, and for constantly seeking out to break the fourth wall. You know what makes boring fetch quests more interesting? When your character grumbles about how irritating and/or ridiculous those quests are. Or when you have to kill people like Chestoros, Braceras, Helmidios, and Legoras in order to acquire the corresponding parts to an armor set. The humor takes the sting out of the monotony & makes the main character more relatable. 

My very favorite quest turned out to be one of the last ones i did. I was wrapping up the Atlantis DLC side stories - the smaller stand-alone quests that were released between the chaptered DLCs - and let me tell you. One Really, Really Bad Day was just straight up comedy gold. Whomever was in charge of writing that one, kudos to you. And thank you. <3

Anyway, I really, really, really love this game. It's going to be hard to jump to Valhalla, where the tone is much more serious."

Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"If a vast, beautiful open world, engaging combat/stealth, fantastic side missions and tons of activities is what you're looking for this game is worth a buy.

I loved AC4 and the fact that this game doubles down on the freedom of that game and removes the super annoying ""real world"" sequences and frustrating tail missions makes this game a vast improvement in my opinion."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"                   As much time I've spent playing this game, I can't recommend it. The 60 hours i spent is how long it took me to finish the main story line. The biggest issue I have with this game is how much fake content they put in it just to fill the empty spaces of the giant world they made. By fake content I mean the same copy and pasted fetch quests, littered all over the world. The amount of low effort, uninteresting, boring quests and npc's in the game is just so disappointing. 

          Another big problem I have with this game is the scummy business practices. Leveling up takes hours of grinding, just to rise a few levels. Each new story quest you're given is a few levels above you, sometimes even more. Forcing you to spend hours on fetch side quests, just to finally play a 10 minute story fetch quest with a couple sentences of exposition. Plus enemies are hit sponges. The combat is decent if it werent so grindy and repetitive. 

         Ubisoft's solution to the slow xp leveling? Micro-transactions. There's a $10 xp boost you can buy that makes the leveling function like a normal game. You pay $60 for the base game, then an extra 10 to be able to play it how it's meant to be played. 

         The beginning and final acts of the game are actually pretty good and entertaining. However, there is about a 25-30 hour long middle period where you're running around doing jack shit and trying to level up. overall, the game is boring with extremely grindy mechanics and scummy business practices. the game looks pretty but that's all it has to offer. everything else is extremely low effort. Thanks for reading, please don't buy this game.

Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"I'm not an AC fan, so I don't give a crap that this isn't a traditional AC game. I just wanted to play as an Ancient Greek warrior, and that's what I got"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"I went into this game without the mindset of [b]""it's an Assassin's Creed game, therefore it must be like every Assassin's Creed game prior and it has to have hidden blades, assassins and the templar order because it's an ASSASSIN'S CREED game!""[/b] and it feels ABSOLUTELY great! I fail to understand how people hate Odyssey for what it is, because what it is is genuinely fantastic. I think everyone should dedicate enough time towards exploring the Ancient Greek world and truly experiencing it.

The main element of ""Assassin's Creed"" is still there, it's just utilised in a different form to its predecessors.

Given the chance, Assassin's Creed Odyssey has the potential to very swiftly become anyone's all time favourite. This game has enough content to keep an average completionist playing for a hundred hours and then some!

In my opinion, people who hate the new instalments are those who have grown too accustomed to what this franchise used to be. [i]It's time to move on.[/i]"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"Best assasins creed, probably should have a different name."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,very many good
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"I’ve played almost every AC game in existence. From the Ezio trilogy to this. And while it’s true that this is only an AC game by name, that doesn’t mean the game is bad. I’ve played 122 hours of this game and had lots of fun with it. From the surprisingly good gameplay to the funny conversations. THIS is what I call a good open world game.

[h1]STORY:[/h1]
You play as a mercenary in Greece during the Pelponesian war. And from then on, you find out about a secret organization that’s plotting to take over Greece. So of course it’s your job to stop them by teeming up with familiar faces and taking them out. The story has some twist and turns which caught me off guard most of the time. Although the final act seems a bit weak if you ask me. Nevertheless, it’s still good and funny sometimes lol. 

You also have dialogue choices that do have consequences. It’s not as deep as some other games but it does its job.

[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]
The graphics of this game look great, but the optimization is terrible. I played this game on an i7 6700k. Most of the time my CPU went to 100% usage and was between 80-95%. Really wished Ubisoft fixed it. Otherwise, the game is detailed and pretty to look at.

[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]
The combat in this game is superb. The number of weapons and abilities you can use is astounding. From swords to spears to hammers. This game has it all. You can mix and match between abilities to give you some sick builds. You want to be a tank that outputs massive damage? Go on ahead. A glass cannon that’s fast and nimble? No problemo. 

The quests are great. You’ve got legendary beasts quests where you fight monsters, Naval quests and the usual quests. Surprised that I wasn’t bored from them lol. 

I’ve heard from a lot of people that the games is grindy and that you need to buy time savers in order to have fun. WRONG. If you play the game like you would any open world RPG, you’d see the opposite. I was over-leveled by the end because I played the game as intended: By doing side quests and exploring. Don’t listen to those who tell you otherwise.

[h1]VERDICT:[/h1]
While AC: Odyssey isn’t the typical AC game we’ve known and love. It’s still an amazing game that’s fun to explore. Combat is amazing, story is decent, and overall the game deserves to be played as long as your specs are good.

I RECOMMEND.
"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"My first day of playing Odyssey was great, just shy 8hrs of gameplay with zero issues. The next day I logged on and I have been consistently getting the same auto close issue where Ubisoft Connect needs to properly save and upload. So, I went offline on Ubisoft Connect and have had zero luck playing longer than 5-10mins at a time before it randomly out of nowhere auto closes the game again."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"After putting in some decent hours I must say this game is fantastic. There is a lot to do here, The campaign is quite lengthy and has many tasks that have to be done, so there is no shortage of stuff to do there. Although, some of the side missions are pretty much copy and pastes of each other, and the cities aren't exactly %100 unique, (you can definitely see some repetition in the smaller countries) it is still absolutely gorgeous in this game, and if your PC can handle it ultra high settings is a dream come true here. However, regardless of that fact I've done more side missions and bounties than I can count and haven't been bored yet, so that says something. I've never played any other assassins creeds before this one so I can't compare, but as a no-bias, first time experience, this game satisfies all of my needs. I %110 recommend this game to anybody who's contemplating purchasing it, it is without a doubt worth every penny."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,Pretty awesome game though I wish it was more optimized for pc.
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,fun
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,Best AC !
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"Pros:  
-Nice looking game
-Nice setting

Cons: 
-Most characters and quests feel shallow and uninteresting - quantity rather than quality
-It seems like every quest you get turns into 3 others, making the game a chore to get through
-Enemies are sponges in combat, they mostly scale to your level too, so they stay spongy 
-Missing the elements of an AC game, missing the elements of a good RPG

Just buy an older AC game (not origins) for an AC experience, or Witcher 3 for a good RPG; get this on sale if you want to play for the setting.

"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,RPG,812140,"This is easily my favorite entry into the series. Kassandra was an extremely likeable main character for me. The gameplay took the best parts of Origins and polished them. Loved the mercenary mechanic. This was also the game that handled the First Civilization storyline to the best degree, in my opinion. Maybe it was because with the rest of the game dealing in ancient greek culture, there was less of an immersion break when doing the Elysium/Underworld/Atlantis DLC. 

I think what really sets this game apart from the others in the series though, is the comedic writing. I liked Origins for Bayek and Aya, and for all of the ancient Egyptian history and culture it portrayed. But I adore Odyssey for it's commitment to poke fun at itself, and for constantly seeking out to break the fourth wall. You know what makes boring fetch quests more interesting?

A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"TL;DR ver:
Only game other than Witcher 3 that I bought DLC for, and I hate DLC/microtrans. That is how good this is. 
10/10 Very cute, almost as cute as my bunny. 

long ass readinisbad4health version, read on if your don't care for your health :
The statment that older games are better is true. Some argue that it is just nostalgia, WRONG. A Hat in Time is a game made with modern sensibilities (memes, references, female protag, female sidekick, female antag becoming female protag's BFF, female...etc), yet it is as good as any classics such as Mario 64, Spyro, or Crash Bandicoot, if not better. I mean a FOV slider and good camera options for a 3rd person game? In a brave new world where FPS don't have FPS sliders? Female PC, this and that without the usual man hating sexism? What a novelty! 

In all serioue though, the game is really fun. Give you loads of options, freedom and cosmetic. Art style is cute without making you puke. Game maps are divided into Acts, with different stages. Dialogues are actaully funny. All the Acts have an interesting theme, Stages are VERY creative without being gimmicky (a bit on the short side so not to overstay their welcome). Music is surprisingly...diverse, ranging from whimsical to smooth jazz to arr-se kicking to suspenseful. My friend overlay the OST on top of Assasin Creed and it fits 100%. Online mode is a anmeic, but there is actual mod support (unlike Vermintide 2), so there is plently to make it better, even it is still barebone. 

No p2w BS, no cut content lock behind 100 paywalls, no offical server needed, no ""content updates"" that remove contents/nerf your fav items/break the game and the mods (but don't bet on it, get it on GOG instead of steam), just pure wholesome fun. Fun. To paraphrase Zero Punctuation: Remember that strange little concept we are not allowed to have anymore? In the name of balance, because every game is constant online DRM multiplayer service since devs can't make good levels anymore...nah who am I kidding devs these days will nerf anything, even if its a single player game with 0 competition, otherwise who the fork would wanna buy their lastest, laziest, overpriced p2w DLC? 

Only negative is not Quick Save, but each stages are short and sweet, so not a big problem.

This game is an amazingly fun and cute lil platformer that defy modern trends, made in the ways games are supposed to be made. If you like classic games, this game is for you. If you ever played Dad sims like Witcher 3, God of War 4 or The Last of Us and thought, ""Hey these kids are awesome, I wonder what it'll be like when they are 5?"", buy this right now, sale or not. If you think the new ""Here Comes Niko"" being published by these devs is too pink and is making your eyes bleed, buy the 2 DLCs as well (while on sale)."
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"A Hat in Time is a game that will take you back to the days of Mario Sunshine this game is absolutely adorable inside and out with so much personality beaming from the worlds to the characters it is an absolute blast 
 The base game is a fun little collectathon story about a little girl known as Hat Kid as she visits an alien planet and although its a simple concept it tells individual stories quite well. 
 Seal the Deal the dlc adds on to the fun on a voyage trip and the Deathwish brings a challenge for any who dare to face it mean't only for the hardcore players quite honestly 
Nyakuza adds a fun end of the main story with this character and although the finale was ok for a final boss it was fun regardless
at the time of this review there are about 4k mods on the workshop with at least 1k being levels and if you are willing to go back to earlier versions of the game for some of those that will add on hours and hours of content for you to enjoy and best of all from fellow fans such as yourself.
SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR GET THIS GAME ITS A MUST HAVE!!!"

A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,Love it
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"This is one of those indie gems. It's got it all; wholesome seals, the literal mafia, a penguin dj, babies with knives... WAIT WHAT?!?! Ok, let's back up a bit here. Oh, and don't worry, I'll try to keep this spoiler free. A Hat in Time is a platformer game about a kid with a hat (surprise!) that is on a quest to get back her hourglasses so she can continue her trip home. You can get different hats with different abilities by collecting yarn around maps in order to stitch them. I really like this system, since it makes unlocking hats more than just getting to a certain area and getting it. The game has a wide variety of likeable characters, from the ones I mentioned earlier to a cat that chases you in an epic escape scene to a Scottish train conductor bird thing that really likes rolling his Rs, One nice thing is that Hat Kid is really fun to move around. She can dive, wall jump, sprint, double jump, and even more all with the press of a button. It's all so fluid and smooth that you always feel so in control. And all her different hats each give her a unique ability, with you switching between them on the fly sometimes with a handy hat wheel. This... brings in one of my critisisms though, It feels like most of the hats are just extra abilities that you just use whenever its thing pops up and switch back to the sprint hat, or it's the sprint hat and you literally always have it on. That's the reason why basically every hat skin on the workshop is for the sprint hat. This leads nicely into my next point,  The game is fairly short, but if you buy the Seal the Deal DLC, there is a very big rage mode that makes the game have a signifigant amount more content, and there's the workshop for even more. The boss fights are also a real challenge, which is really nice, and they feel meaningful since you fight characters after an entire chapter. There's a lot more I could get into here, but overall, if you're done with Mario Odyssey and looking for another platformer, or just want a good game, here it is."
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"Without exageration, this is one of the best games I've ever played, you can clearly see the amount of effort used to create this game. Although with a few issues the controls are great, as good as how mario controls in his games. An amazing soundtrack with a lot of great songs. This an absolute must for fans of platformers, collectathons or indie games in general. 100% recomended"
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"I've been telling people this and Slime Rancher are two of the best non-triple A games of the 2010s ever since they came out, but I guess I forgot to review specifically AHIT.

It's cute, it's funny, it feels amazing to move around in, and the challenge available goes from beginner all the way up to some of the hardest content I've [i]ever[/i] experienced in a video game, with Death Wish contracts.

Add in the modding support with tons of custom-made maps and rifts (which continue giving tokens you can literally use to unlock [i]modded-in[/i] cosmetics of your choosing), and this game is an easy 10/10."
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"hats, yes. i run around doing stuff and get hourglasses, cool. reminds me of super mario sunshine, i love the sunshine. yes."
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"As an alien that looks like Willy Wonka as a child once said; ""This game is good and is well worth the combined price of $42."""
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,10/10 pog game
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,Best gamecube game ever not made for the gamecube
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"This is easily my favorite game on steam. Whats not to love? The characters and scenes are amazingly created and the mastermind behind the soundtrack, Pascal Micheal Stiefel, is an absolute genius. I listen to the OST over and over, I don't think i'll ever get tired of it. The online capabilities are a lot of fun too, you can very easily make new friends and run around the different levels with them, just by walking up and emoting. Despite the cherry exterior, this game can be REALLY hard. The Seal the Deal DLC adds 114 death wish stamps for you to complete, and when the first boss has been made harder than the final boss in the main game, you know you're in for a struggle. But, believe me, completing all of the death wishes is very satisfying and I was left with a sense of pride and accomplishment. 

I could probably ramble on about how much I love this game for hours, but nobody wants to read that, so, concluding, If you don't have this game yet, BUY IT NOW! I promise you it will not disappoint.

A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"I've been telling people this and Slime Rancher are two of the best non-triple A games of the 2010s ever since they came out, but I guess I forgot to review specifically AHIT.

It's cute, it's funny, it feels amazing to move around in, and the challenge available goes from beginner all the way up to some of the hardest content I've [i]ever[/i] experienced in a video game, with Death Wish contracts.

Add in the modding support with tons of custom-made maps and rifts (which continue giving tokens you can literally use to unlock [i]modded-in[/i] cosmetics of your choosing), and this game is an easy 10/10."
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"hats, yes. i run around doing stuff and get hourglasses, cool. reminds me of super mario sunshine, i love the sunshine. yes."
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"As an alien that looks like Willy Wonka as a child once said; ""This game is good and is well worth the combined price of $42."""
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,10/10 pog game
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,Best gamecube game ever not made for the gamecube
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"This is easily my favorite game on steam. Whats not to love? The characters and scenes are amazingly created and the mastermind behind the soundtrack, Pascal Micheal Stiefel, is an absolute genius. I listen to the OST over and over, I don't think i'll ever get tired of it. The online capabilities are a lot of fun too, you can very easily make new friends and run around the different levels with them, just by walking up and emoting. Despite the cherry exterior, this game can be REALLY hard. The Seal the Deal DLC adds 114 death wish stamps for you to complete, and when the first boss has been made harder than the final boss in the main game, you know you're in for a struggle. But, believe me, completing all of the death wishes is very satisfying and I was left with a sense of pride and accomplishment. 

I could probably ramble on about how much I love this game for hours, but nobody wants to read that, so, concluding, If you don't have this game yet, BUY IT NOW! I promise you it will not disappoint.

10/10"
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,got dam is this a good platformer
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,Peck!
A Hat in Time,Indie,253230,"If you love early 2000s platformers (like the GameCube / PS2 era) this it's a must.

Pros:
[list]
    [*] Charming Art Direction and music
    [*] Fun to play
    [*] Great value considering its pricing, a lot of hours of content despite being an indie dev
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] A few bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking
[/list]

If you want the nostalgia of your childhood, but at the same time something modern A Hat in a time it's a game that deserves a chance."
Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Stop right here!

Do not read anything further. Do not look at screenshots or reviews etc. 

Just start the game and jump into it without any expectations.

If you don't know why I can only tell you this: If you would describe yourself as a curious person then this is a game for you. Curiosity is the natural ally of this game."

The rest is up to you to find out."

Outer Wilds,Adventure,753640,"Outer Wilds es un jueguito cautivador construido de manera inteligente y muy cuidada que plantea un misterio inicial en un mundo completamente abierto.
Conforme exploramos los rincones del sistema solar encontramos pistas y piezas del puzzle que forman la historia, permitiéndonos atar cabos sin ningún orden en particular. Esto quizás requiera algo de paciencia a veces y de atención al detalle, pero el juego sabe compensarte y picarte la curiosidad.

Es un poco difícil hablar de este juego porque cuanto menos se sepa antes de entrar en él, casi que mejor. 

Recomendaría Outer Wilds a todo el mundo. Es muy bueno, tiene una historia y una banda sonora preciosas, y sin duda es de esos que dejan huella."

Truly a once in a lifetime game.

The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320, I'm going to need season 2 ASAP !
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,"""I'm not saying it's fair, but it's real. People are scared of you."" 

If this is your first Telltale game then you're in for a surprising treat and if not then you know to expect a compelling story. The Wolf Among Us is one of my favorite Telltale game alongside The Walking Dead. The voice acting is phenomenal and I really love the character designs, they were really creative with it. In this tale you play as Bigby Wolf, the sheriff of Fabletown, trying to solve the mystery of a fable that's been murdered and why their head was placed on your doorstep. There are a bunch of fairy tale characters we all know and love that you'll come across in Fabletown like Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, and so on, but don't let that fool you. The Wolf Among Us is not a child's fantasy story. These characters had to abandon their homes and happily ever afters to live alongside mundies (regular humans) in Fabletown. In doing so they're faced with real serious problems and issues like debt, forced prostitution/labor, and because of the corrupt people in power the only one they can truly rely on is Bigby Wolf. As hesitant as they are to go to him for help (considering his brutal past) they really have no other choice. Either go to the once 'Big Bad Wolf' for help or suffer in silence.

While uncovering the mysteries behind the murders in Fabletown will you play as *the* Big Bad Wolf or the Sheriff? The choice is yours."
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,the wolf is amogus sus !!!!!! :D
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,"The Wolf Among Us is my definitive highlight of the old branch of Telltale's games, without any doubt. 

The game exudes atmosphere and ambience like nobody's business, coupled with this universe's fascinating premise of fairy tale characters of old being trapped in our modern reality, having to live in the shadows to protect their secret society from the mundies (us regular, non-suspecting folk). A stellar moody soundtrack breathes life into the already superb graphic novel-inspired visuals, and all of this is supported by a world with rich lore (based on Bill Willingham's [i] Fables [/i]) that leaves me wanting for so much more. While it does suffer from this studio's illusion of choice in that your decisions are ultimately funnelled down a fairly linear storyline, and there's an excess of combat since this is still a ""big dumb video game"", the story here is nuanced and solidly told to mostly negate your limited ability to shape it. Bigby Wolf is a riveting protagonist and his struggle against his true nature (being the Big Bad Wolf and all) makes for a compelling personal story, coupled with the fantastic noir-esque main plot that has you sleuthing around Fabletown, following the footsteps of an elusive killer. 

This review might seem a tad bit redundant, considering the overwhelmingly positive reception on the game's page, but I love it so much to throw my cent(s) in there regardless. This is a game not-to-be-missed!"
The Wolf Among Us,Adventure,250320,"If you missed out on The Wolf Among Us, now is a good time to enjoy the entertaining fairy tale crime story in all its glory. I truly enjoy Telltale, so this game is the epitome of that love. And yeah i want a season 2"

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,This game really shows how something cute and cuddly can piss off and please even one of the most hard core gamers.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,"If you asked me if I'd recommend this game when it first came out, I'd say no. Back then, it was pretty much the same 10 minigames over and over, which got boring REALLY fast. 

But now, as of the time I'm writing this (season 4.5) there are 46 different minigames, and that number doesn't include the fact that many minigames have random variations that might change up the game significantly, so really the amount of UNIQUE minigames is probably up in the hundreds. Now I can play for an hour and barely see any repeat minigames, which was basically impossible when this game first launched. 

TL:DR The game used to be boring, but now it isn't since the devs added (and are continuing to add) a bunch of new minigames which helps keep it fresh.

Plus the music has no right being that good"

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,Um...for me fall guys was not a bad game aand sometimes we win and lose when i got to the easy place with many people i almost done but my time was up its making me what ahahha even i didnt win but i still like it i just play this game if i wanted it i hope you guys like this game i dont know you guys like or not but for me this is a normal fun game

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,"I'd love it if I could recommend this game to you people out there. I really do. But if they're going to charge 30 dollars for it, I can't morally tell anyone to buy it. This game is really fun... for the first 3-4 days. Once you get the initial hype out of it, the game just becomes repetetive and annoying. Once you get your first win, the game just becomes completely stale. Even with the new maps, I find myself playing cheap knockoffs more often than the actual game. For a ""chill"" game, most of the stages are just unreasonable punishing and extremely difficult to get any practice in. If you like that and have the budget, go ahead. But if you re just looking for a relaxing challenge to sink some hours into, this game is really just a waste of money. I did enjoy this game, but only for about 5 hours."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,Not for me. Friends convinced me to get it after saying it 900 times. Wish I didn't spend the money.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,It's a fun game to play either alone or with friends. It gets boring after a while though and it is too expensive for what it offers.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Casual,1097150,"Overall It's a good game, its fun and challenging, its fun with friends, and yes i know its a negative review and it is because,

IT IS NOT WORTH £16,

That is what i call overpay and a half, this game gets repetitive fast and it has simple graphics (Ik that's what the dev's were going for) that didn't take much effort to make, maps that didn't take much effort to make, skins that didn't take much effort to make, so why the fu- does this game cost 16 pounds??

This game died months ago yet they still charge 16 pounds.

Get it on sale when its super cheap because that is what this game is worth."

Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition,Strategy,3590,"Plants vs. Zombies is quite the addictive tower defense game, where you protect the house from goofy-looking zombies, using a variety of flowers and varierty of plants, mushrooms and such. It's quite the relaxing game, and if well the adventure mode is short, it has a lot of replayability with the Adventure Mode replay mode, the Mini-Games, the Puzzle modes, Survival Mode, and also getting upgrades for plants and taking care of stuff at the Zen Garden for some pretty pennies. For a simple game, it has a lot of depth, and the variety of plants makes it open for various strategies.

The graphics are cartoony and vibrant, quite the charming game for his age. As for the music, it has a lot of catchy tunes, composed by Laura Shigihara, bringing a lot of the charm for the music composed for this game.

Do I recommend it? Absolutely! This is a modern classic that can be enjoyed for most people. Just make sure that to get the zombies off your lawn, will ya?"

Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"Only 2.3 hours in and I can see myself playing way more of this. 

Play casually, or challenge yourself by meeting the level conditions in order to get the achievement(s) for the stage. Earning the stage achievement(s) seems to give you more experience than without earning them, and goes towards unlocking songs with each level up. Regardless of whether or not you actually get the stage achievement(s), you still earn experience, and you obtain miscellaneous items that are used to unlock characters, companions, etc.

If you've played rhythm games before, this game should be an easy adjustment from what you're used to. Highly recommend."
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"I fully recommend this awesome game to everyone. 
Muse Dash is a rhythm game featuring flashy visuals and mostly electronic music."
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"PROS:
-Great sync and flow to the maps
-Overall very fitting songs to the game
-The design of the game is mostly very nice

CONS:
-The style to unlock more songs and difficult songs
-Unnecessary fanservice that can leave an odd taste in your mouth should you stumble upon it.
-A lot of maps are restricted and you need to buy the DLC to get them, and that thing is EXPENSIVE

OVERALL:
A solid game overall that will give you lots of entertainment and satisfaction, but if I open the game to hear an anime girl moan ""peroperogaming"" again then I'm going to throw something

Muse Dash,Casual,774171,I bought it for boobs but I guess this is cool too
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"I've been playing this game so much since I bought it, it's a super fun rythem game that's not too hard.

I mean, i'm bad at rythem games but this one looked fun so I decided to buy it and it's really fun, really recommend it."
Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"If you're looking for a non-bland rhythm game, this is a must-try. Vibrant colors, exciting music, unusual music notes, and horizontal gameplay, are what made Muse Dash a unique rhythm game.

From my 15 hours of playing, Muse Dash is quite easy to get a grasp since it only has 2 lines of notes, but quite difficult to master, especially the speed and patterns in higher difficulties. There are up to 3 difficulties in a single song, which leaves you no worries of not being able to complete your favorite song.

It might take quite a time to get used to the game due to its unusual music notes and horizontal gameplay. Also, high refresh rate monitors (120Hz+) are recommended.

For the cons, the game has specific characters and elfins (a creature floating next to the character) which can help boost your score. Simply, the score isn't solely based on your ability, but also the character and elfin selection, which is the feature I quite dislike.

I also hope for the game to make more use of the Steam features not just putting the game up in the store, for example, Steam achievements, collectible cards, and ranking between friends.

Overall, Muse Dash is really an exciting game with many pros and a cheap price that anyone can try. If you really love the game, there is a DLC for you to pick up, which helps you level up faster, unlocks tons of more songs, and a few characters."

Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,10/10 Game Dev and Simulation is a great combo - Average Gamer
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,"i will make ubisoft games withtout bugs 
and i will make gta 6 and half life 3"
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,tbh there's not much to say. You develop games. You can choose genres and platforms.  You can follow wiki's combos if you don't want to test them out yourselves. Make money and build up your fan base. Solid time killer 👍
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,"This game is great, but provides some ridiculous expectations. While helming my company, Speed Racist, I hired a few programmers that were apparent morons who had never seen computers before. I had to pay these bags of idiocy $35,000 a month just to have a functioning studio. As someone who's worked in the industry, you can put an entire QA team in indentured servitude for a whole year for this amount - just ask CD Project Red.

Additionally, my first game, the dancing simulation wonder Dance France Revolution, had underwhelming sales. I assigned perfect sliders and marketed exclusively to rebellious teenagers trying to break their puritanical roots, but it still flopped. Frankly, I can't fathom a time and place this game wouldn't be a resounding success.

My next foray into gaming, NBA 0K: Christ Rises 4 the Jam, also flopped. Again, due to the considerable idiocy of my team, who spent literal weeks scratching their heads, we scored a solid 3/10 on a genuine gold mine of a franchise. If 2K has taught me anything, it's that it takes no effort to make a sequel to a sports game. 

Overall, it's a fun but frustrating simulation. Obviously, it mimics game development 100%, so if you can succeed at this game you can make a game dev studio. I recommend that we all spend our entire life savings making a game studio that develops game development simulations development. It's a guaranteed success - I know this because my attempt at it scored an 11/10 in Game Dev Tycoon."
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,"Quite fun. With plenty of opportunity to test out a different genres and mix them up in the weirdest of ways, a nice way exploring the game developers world. There's plenty of stuffs to do, even after you get the ""victory"" message. Definitely recommended."
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,"I've played this game for far longer than 4 hours before I purchased it here (cough). The game is good in theory, but the disconnect between what the game appears to be about (trying to make good games while balancing your time and budget) and is actually about (trying to maximize the difference in quality between the games you make) is incredibly disorienting and frustrating.

Ironically, my first few playthroughs were far more successful than my more recent playthroughs because I got better at making games as the campaign progressed, but once I was able to make a perfect games every time and for lest cost I started getting terrible reviews for every game I made and going bankrupt.

This is because there is no in-game market which your games are compared against, only your own. So, if you make good games early on, your first game will get good reviews and all subsequent games will get mediocre and progressively-worse reviews. If you improve the quality of your games incrementally, this will not outweigh the bad reviews, until you slowly go bankrupt. The game essentially forces you to make bad games and release quality improvements slowly, even if you're capable of doing tons better.

So, basically I find this game very frustrating to play because the way the game expects you to play is so different from the way which is both most intuitive, and in my opinion, the most fun to play. I would recommend against buying or playing it. If you disagree, that's fine, but I'm leaving my review nonetheless in hopes of warning any potential future players."
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,"Fun game, you can tell it was made with love."
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,"play game make game big game

money make

yeeeeee 

good game"
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,"Buy it
Now
I bet you have 10 dollars lying around so buy it.
IT'S SUCH A GOOD GAME!"
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,A funny and...interesting one. The game reminds me the Reigns series but better. 100% worth the price!
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,"My most sold game was "" The Sims in my butt 2""

 2.5 million copies sold"
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,the weird thing about this game is you get an achievement by buying the game and only 97 percent of people who own the game have the achievement wtf?
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,Game Dev and Simulation is a great combination.
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,"Ok-ish but underwhelmed after seeing this game has a review level of ""overwhelming"". Very basic gameplay whereby you need to find the right balance of maybe 5 to 6 variables. Will give it a ""positive"" rating for now but only because i bought it heavily discounted."
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,"Super fun. Takes some effort to figure out where to allocate your attention when making games and as you begin unlocking research to try new genres or combinations of them or new technology in general you'll find that if you want good results you'll need to do more than just point, click, and wait. Love the love put in to this game. I give this game a solid A out of 5. If you like the tycoon genre give it a try."
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,"This game is amazingly fun when you have a creative side. it isn't long but it isn't short either. You can have a lot of fun trying to get better reviews and scores. It's considerably one of the funniest small games I've played in a long time. To the developers, your game is extremely well made. Although, I wish you could have a longer story span. Reaching over 70 or 100 years. It would be cool to see new workers come as go as time goes by as well as new owners. That's only my opinion though. The game could use a few newer ways. Like be able to develop technology even further than what the game allows. The game can be stale at times with the repetitiveness but because it's such a small game with a small developer, it's promising nonetheless. Thank you for an amazing experience. I will be playing this for days on end in the future <3"
Game Dev Tycoon,Strategy,239820,"I pirated this game (then bought it)

So, this is a very good game so far. I love cleaning things with a pressure washer.
The level´s are very cool and the gameplay is really fun. I would like to see a lot more missions in the future.
The only thing that !bothers! me is just that the game steals the dirt. Just before finishing a component, the game washes away the dirt on its own.
That takes the fun a little out of the game, because you want to clean up the dirt by yourself.

PowerWash Simulator,Simulation,1290000,"As someone who enjoys the cleaning portion of House Flipper more than the decorating and selling parts... man, this game was a dream come true.

The game is early access, so I can only hope that it'll be improved over time, but I think it's a great game if you want to do something peaceful and monotonous for a few hours. It seems like it takes ~15-16 hours to finish the available jobs.

My current criticisms are that the game really needs to balance out its criteria for enough dirt having been washed away to consider a segment complete--it'll either jump to finished with a substantial chunk left to clean and deprive you of that experience, or you'll spend forever walking around in circles, hitting tab, trying to find the angle that'll show you the minuscule speck of dirt that's left to clean up. 

Definitely recommend if you like the cleaning portions of House Flipper or Viscera Cleanup Detail, although it's a little flatter on the ground so far than either of those."

Whether that was due to it actually being longer or from me getting bored out of my head, no one will know. Some of them was good and bad. 

Overall, Senren Banka was a good game with an overall decent efforts to explain the story to the readers, In previous Yususoft title, Sanoba Witch is much better compared to this one."

Super Animal Royale,Massively%20Multiplayer,843380,"Alright so I've seen a lot of my friends finally start playing this game so I might as well write this review.

I've been addicted to this game for a while now and there are only a couple of small issues with the game that aren't game breaking. The game is fun, a lot of fun with friends. It's the only battle royale game I like and I dont feel bad about playing it often.

I've met a ton of friends on this game as well, some insanely close friends and I always look forward to playing it with them. The developers of this game are also so kind and caring and I'm glad to even know a couple.

This is definitely a game worth your time to check out, it's free as well so why not give it a try?"
Super Animal Royale,Massively%20Multiplayer,843380,"Honestly, I love this game.  It's fast, cute, hilarious and fun.  With that said, and I hate that I'm leaving a negative review for this, I feel like I've been lied to by the developers.

The recent update brought 'cross-play' to the game.  To quote the developers, this means 'cross-play matchmaking support for Steam and Xbox players to play together'.  In literally every game that's ever been cross-play (that I can remember at least), that means you and your console peasant friends on different systems can finally play a game together.

But that's not the case here- you will play -against- people from other platforms (with PC having the obvious advantage), but you cannot play -with- people from other platforms.  This was never explained pre-update, nor has it been explained since.  After talking this game up for over a month with my Xbox friends (who I can never game with as I'm a PC master race guy), I discovered that you cannot party up with people on other platforms- you can only (possibly) play against them at random.  Oh, and half of my unlocks that I spent weeks/months on magically disappeared, so that was cool too.

This is confusing at best, misleading at worst, and regardless of where your personal thoughts fall on this scale, ultimately disappointing.  Please devs, if you're reading this or hearing similar feedback, fix this or at least explain it."

Super Animal Royale,Massively%20Multiplayer,843380,"Uh how have I played this game for 1600 and forget to review it lmao? Yeah its good.

It's actually a really easy to grasp and simple game to pickup. At first glance it might seem like ""oh this looks like an EZ game I can sweep the floor and dumpster other players no problem"". No, not even close, it can be really intense and crazy despite the looks of the game. And when you down to the wire everyone flying over the place maneuvering and trying to outshout and outplay you it's such an adrenaline rush sometimes. And when you come out on top whether solo or with a squad and the match is over. It just makes you go ""whew, that was crazy!"", then you just want to keep playing more. 

Also, matches are pretty quick too (5-10 minutes if you were to reach it to the end) and thats a major thing I like. Also, unlike most BR/Multiplayer games where if you quit you may get a temporary suspension or put into a ""bad player lobby"" like major retail games, you don't get penalized other than you won't recieve XP/drops. Not that I like quitters, but if you are a person with bad internet/disconnection, or if something comes up urgently, or if you have to get off the computer expecting an average game of ~45 minutes turns into a 2 hour match for no real good reason  (*cough cough* Dota 2, LoL, etc. etc.), its the worst feeling getting penalized for it."

Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,u really get to play golf with ur friends but i spend most the time spectating as im the greatest and always get my ball in first
Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,"If you play without collision, You don't deserve to win ;)"
Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,"I normally don't comment on any forums, but I feel this amount of frustration can be taken care of being hopefully reaching the developers. 

While I love this game, and spend lots of hours practising, but it seems the game has a lot to do with lucky and skill. I can take criticism time and time again and improve my scores only so much on a recognised course, but I fail to see how some unthinkable score cards are a reflection of my ability to play your game. We all have very basic access to the likely basic controls of the game.

This has led me to understand and notice some understandable yet doable updates. 
1. Improve the speed at which we painlessly can watch our ball roll to any place on the map that isn't in the hole. Yes this would include out of bounds areas that auto glitch to last play position. I am aware there are sweet points off grid course. I don't need to see it roll along...or float...I know this is possible as older games have it. Just a thought. please.

2. More direction on the course. You offer a brief ability to skim the course ahead. 15 sec. In many cases this is not long enough for me. In turn, I fail to get an appropriate angle at a shot. Assuming I haven't used all my view time. If there is a way to keep the flag option on during play that would make a huge difference.

3. The roll and bounce of the ball is a little too much. I'm not sure if there will or can be settings which would allow for more realistic bounce. Its a little tricky to gauge the need of shot at times. Even with the meter level reader. The problem may be in the environment settings and not the game play. Shot which roll in different points of any course have varying effects. Not sure if a settings open in general can be added to reduce realistic values if this is a standard mode. Perhaps a more relaxed version.

4. Great game Overall. I would enjoy it more if it had more holes by steam as well. Super awesome this came out. A nice way to sit back and hound away at a ball. or Puck. Golf With your Friends 2 will be great with all the other suggestions i've seen. The workshop has been a blast to play. 

Way to go developers. Solid efforts indeed. 4.5/5"
Golf With Your Friends,Sports,431240,"Best golf game I've played. The power, and direction is 100% predictable so for many holes you could just memorize the hole in one tricks.

I don't personally like the single player, but with friends I don't think I'll ever lose a taste for a lil gwyf."

VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"I bought this game the night after I lost my father back in December of 2020 and it's truthfully a purchase that I'll never regret. I loved the soundtrack and the story and everything about the game, and although I'm yet to 100% the game, it's still a game that I can't help but to say it's one of, if not, it is my favorite game I've ever played. I look forward to getting to play the next game once it's released but I can't really say there's nothing wrong with the game. The story did make me tear up a bit, but that was okay. I'm happy that I played the game."

"
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"-I bought this game and played it YEARS ago. It was featured a lot at the 2016 vidya gaem awards and I though it looked really cute. 

-I never played a VN before so I was afraid I wasn't going to be kept engaged in the story, but that's why the drink mixing minigame is there. Serving as an incentive to keep you focused to receive optimal dialogue between Jill and her clients and it works perfectly. I found myself being invested in some of the characters hoping I'd be able to see them again soon, or being riddled with curiosity when a new customer stumbled into the bar and what their story was. I was encapsulated and didn't want to put the game down back then, but I did, I'll talk about that later and with a spoiler warning. 
-VA-11 Hall-A, provides probably one of the most human experiences in a video game that I can think of. Working in a service style job and listening to the everyday problems of , for the most part, regular people. They're so well established as people with their own lives that sometimes you don't get conclusions to some of their stories. As it currently stands, some of them are still working their jobs and have their ongoing problems. It's really bittersweet. I may never know how their story concludes, but I'm happy they came across Valhalla however they did, and felt comfortable enough to share their stories with me.

[b]Warning spoilers ahead for one of the major themes of the story[/b]
[spoiler]I want to preface this with a personal story, I stopped talking with my mother a couple of years before this game. I don't really remember the reason, but she wasn't evil and didn't do anything that made me distrust her. I was just incredibly frustrated and hurt one day, and I left her to live with my dad. Years passed and I started wondering I left so abruptly and without word, and I started to feel bad about it. However, I couldn't bring myself to talk to her. I felt so much fear, anxiety, anger(?) with the idea of finally confronting her and talking about it.[/spoiler]
[spoiler]Those that have played the game probably know why I'd bother bringing this up. Jill's relationship with Lenore and Gaby and how that ended, before resurfacing years later forcing Jill to confront Gaby and talk about what happened, reminded me of my situation with my mother. I cried for a while before saving my progress and quitting the game. I didn't resume my playthrough for a while after that.[/spoiler]

-Years later after an emotional break, that I eventually solved, I came back to finish the game I was so invested with from the beginning. It only felt fair to give the game a fair completion for what it had provided me. With a fresh start with the intention to get the good ending, I set off to experience the world again. Remembering all the ups and downs as I had experienced them initially.  Finally finishing the base game recently, I'm finally comfortable enough to try and put my feelings into positive words for the game.
-My words may be jumbled and excessive, but I don't know how else to express how much I love what this game offers and what it means to me."
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,A very comforting game to play after a depressing day and you just want to lie back and play without the worry of many choices.
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"Cute story about a bartender in a cyberpank world.

Play this game if you like:
- Stories
- Well written dialogs
- Good background music
- Relatable, believable characters

Do not expect from this game:
- Meaningful gameplay choices
- Novella-like experience

And remember to pay your rent!"
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"This game has more world-building than most other AAA titles out there. It really made me wanna travel to Glitch City, become a bartender and serve drinks.

VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action is what it strives to be and it delivers. You're a bartender and you serve drinks, talk with customers, have regulars that say the cliché line ""the usual, please"" and takes place in a bar in the Cyberpunk, Glitch City. 

Pros:
+Great music,
+Fun dialogue,
+Interesting characters,
+Immersive world,
+Aesthetic visuals

Cons:
-Serving drinks can get repetitive

In my honest opinion, the game is best enjoyed playing while midnight with your favorite drink, snacks. It's a very relaxing and a unique game, experience."
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,Now I can be a Bartender like Jill!
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,yep
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"[i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] was a surprisingly potent and intelligent game, even if it did have some misses here and there.

Going into this title, I did not have any sort of expectations as to how the game would go. Seeing as it was a bartending game, I wasn't positive if it would be a very involved or overly simplistic approach to said genre of food preparation releases. Well, the gameplay is a bit strange at first and you might need to practice with the system for a few minutes, but after you get a basic grasp of it, the game is rather simple. Sure, there are some orders you must know to serve with intuition and deduction skills, but besides this, it would be hard to fail a day or somehow manage not to pay your rent on time, which is the main objective of the game. There are items you can buy to increase your performance later on during your shift, websites you can visit to squeeze out more lore from the game, and even a mini-game you can attempt to complete on the side after purchasing the game console in the aforementioned store. Luckily, the main focus is not on the gameplay, but rather, the characters and the narrative they are all intertwined in in some way or another, as the gameplay, in all honest, would not be strong enough to carry an entire game. 

[i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] is more so about the people that walk into your place of work and tell you about recent news, personal information, and just small talk about whatever they find worthwhile. You can build relationships with them through getting their orders correct, and in some cases, deciding what is best for them under certain circumstances, which can unlock their respective endings if you guess correctly. What I did not really expect from this game that I got was a sense of maturity when handling certain subject matters, such as dealing with grief and moving forward in life. What I did sort of expect, however, were unrealistic fantastical elements that are reminiscent of other anime-inspired pieces. When I say fantastical, it is not to say that it is enchanting, but rather unrealistic. Obviously, this game is not meant to be realistic in the slightest when it comes to the premise, but there are good and bad qualities pertaining to being unrealistic one must compare to understand what I mean. Cat woman cyborg hybrids and talking dogs with Hawaiian shirts and sunglasses can be charming and creative additions to a game, but when you attempt to create a game or really any media that is both funny and serious, there had to be a good balancing act taking place. Most of the time, the game does a great job, but sometimes, it misses and I was left with either a bad taste in my mouth or just bored and uninvolved.

During the game, there will be very eventful days and some throwaway ones. Since the game is focused on the rather mundane goal of being able to afford a porn subscription (yes, that is the first primary objective) and ultimately pay your rent, the ending feels rather anticlimactic as a result. Even though there is a main plot point that takes hold around the halfway point which gives the player a look further into the protagonist's  past and present personal life and this leads the rest of the story to this specific concluding point, the point still stands that this piece can lack direction at times. Now, if you have seen any type of story in which this type of character development takes place (meaning the one [i]Jill[/i], the protagonist, faces), you won't really get that much more out of the way this story goes through the same motions, especially because it doesn't try to do anything but the bare minimum to get across its message. Some other characters fell flat for me as well, such as [i]Dana[/i], the boss, and [i]Gillian[/i], your co-bartender, leaving two core characters I was supposed to be acquainted with not fulfilling their purpose, which is rather disappointing in its own right.

Besides these two main gripes, though, I really did have a good time with this game. It surprised me in some ways that I didn't really expect and made up for its flaws in other ways, such as the brilliant art design, sound direction, and character interaction. A lot can be forgiven since it is not supposed to be some brilliant or profound work, which is why I only really fault it for what it lacks as far as the [i]Slice of Life[/i] and [i]Visual Novel[/i] genres go because that is what it is at its core. [i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] is a quaint and heartfelt hybrid that is worthwhile to play through, even if it may not seem life your type of game, as it is more mature than many of its contemporaries and makes an attempt at being human even when dealing with a cybernetic and perhaps even dystopian future.

I picked this game up on a whim, not knowing anything about it, just that the cover art intrigued me. I'm very happy to say this is one of my favorite visual novel style games, hell, it might be one of my favorite games period. 

You play as Jill, a non-nonsense bartender who tends bar at a rundown and shoddy bar which seems to have a penchant for attracting all kinds of odd customers. At first the thought of having to make ""drinks"" for these random characters seemed stupid. But as each character comes in, night after night, and you remember their orders and various conversations you've had, you realize that this is a very well written story. 

Every character feels like someone who could actually be real. From the obnoxious and domineering Mr Donovan (who could very well have been my first boss in real life), to the crazy hyper Streamer-Chan (who is basically a walking LSF poster child), to all the other not-so-random characters who start to frequent your bar, they all feel alive. 

One of my favorite mechanics in the game is that each night at the start and midpoint of your shift, you get to reset the jukebox with 12 of your choice songs. Some of these songs you start with, others you collect throughout the game. The music is absolutely amazing and legitimately one of the best OSTs I've listened to in a while. 

The visual styling of this game proves that 3D and fancy ""life-like"" graphics are not needed to make beautiful art. Every character is unique and memorable, from the ""John"" face of your colleague Gillian, to the tomboyish look of Sei, the paramedic Valkyrie who is more interested in the carnage at the scenes she visits, they all look amazing. 

So, yes, buy the game, it's worth it."

VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"-I bought this game and played it YEARS ago. It was featured a lot at the 2016 vidya gaem awards and I though it looked really cute. 

-I never played a VN before so I was afraid I wasn't going to be kept engaged in the story, but that's why the drink mixing minigame is there. Serving as an incentive to keep you focused to receive optimal dialogue between Jill and her clients and it works perfectly. I found myself being invested in some of the characters hoping I'd be able to see them again soon, or being riddled with curiosity when a new customer stumbled into the bar and what their story was. I was encapsulated and didn't want to put the game down back then, but I did, I'll talk about that later and with a spoiler warning. 
-VA-11 Hall-A, provides probably one of the most human experiences in a video game that I can think of. Working in a service style job and listening to the everyday problems of , for the most part, regular people. They're so well established as people with their own lives that sometimes you don't get conclusions to some of their stories. As it currently stands, some of them are still working their jobs and have their ongoing problems. It's really bittersweet. I may never know how their story concludes, but I'm happy they came across Valhalla however they did, and felt comfortable enough to share their stories with me.

[b]Warning spoilers ahead for one of the major themes of the story[/b]
[spoiler]I want to preface this with a personal story, I stopped talking with my mother a couple of years before this game. I don't really remember the reason, but she wasn't evil and didn't do anything that made me distrust her. I was just incredibly frustrated and hurt one day, and I left her to live with my dad. Years passed and I started wondering I left so abruptly and without word, and I started to feel bad about it. However, I couldn't bring myself to talk to her. I felt so much fear, anxiety, anger(?) with the idea of finally confronting her and talking about it.[/spoiler]
[spoiler]Those that have played the game probably know why I'd bother bringing this up. Jill's relationship with Lenore and Gaby and how that ended, before resurfacing years later forcing Jill to confront Gaby and talk about what happened, reminded me of my situation with my mother. I cried for a while before saving my progress and quitting the game. I didn't resume my playthrough for a while after that.[/spoiler]

-Years later after an emotional break, that I eventually solved, I came back to finish the game I was so invested with from the beginning. It only felt fair to give the game a fair completion for what it had provided me. With a fresh start with the intention to get the good ending, I set off to experience the world again. Remembering all the ups and downs as I had experienced them initially.  Finally finishing the base game recently, I'm finally comfortable enough to try and put my feelings into positive words for the game.
-My words may be jumbled and excessive, but I don't know how else to express how much I love what this game offers and what it means to me."
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,A very comforting game to play after a depressing day and you just want to lie back and play without the worry of many choices.
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"Cute story about a bartender in a cyberpank world.

Play this game if you like:
- Stories
- Well written dialogs
- Good background music
- Relatable, believable characters

Do not expect from this game:
- Meaningful gameplay choices
- Novella-like experience

And remember to pay your rent!"
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"This game has more world-building than most other AAA titles out there. It really made me wanna travel to Glitch City, become a bartender and serve drinks.

VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action is what it strives to be and it delivers. You're a bartender and you serve drinks, talk with customers, have regulars that say the cliché line ""the usual, please"" and takes place in a bar in the Cyberpunk, Glitch City. 

Pros:
+Great music,
+Fun dialogue,
+Interesting characters,
+Immersive world,
+Aesthetic visuals

Cons:
-Serving drinks can get repetitive

In my honest opinion, the game is best enjoyed playing while midnight with your favorite drink, snacks. It's a very relaxing and a unique game, experience."
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,Now I can be a Bartender like Jill!
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,yep
VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"[i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] was a surprisingly potent and intelligent game, even if it did have some misses here and there.

Going into this title, I did not have any sort of expectations as to how the game would go. Seeing as it was a bartending game, I wasn't positive if it would be a very involved or overly simplistic approach to said genre of food preparation releases. Well, the gameplay is a bit strange at first and you might need to practice with the system for a few minutes, but after you get a basic grasp of it, the game is rather simple. Sure, there are some orders you must know to serve with intuition and deduction skills, but besides this, it would be hard to fail a day or somehow manage not to pay your rent on time, which is the main objective of the game. There are items you can buy to increase your performance later on during your shift, websites you can visit to squeeze out more lore from the game, and even a mini-game you can attempt to complete on the side after purchasing the game console in the aforementioned store. Luckily, the main focus is not on the gameplay, but rather, the characters and the narrative they are all intertwined in in some way or another, as the gameplay, in all honest, would not be strong enough to carry an entire game. 

[i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] is more so about the people that walk into your place of work and tell you about recent news, personal information, and just small talk about whatever they find worthwhile. You can build relationships with them through getting their orders correct, and in some cases, deciding what is best for them under certain circumstances, which can unlock their respective endings if you guess correctly. What I did not really expect from this game that I got was a sense of maturity when handling certain subject matters, such as dealing with grief and moving forward in life. What I did sort of expect, however, were unrealistic fantastical elements that are reminiscent of other anime-inspired pieces. When I say fantastical, it is not to say that it is enchanting, but rather unrealistic. Obviously, this game is not meant to be realistic in the slightest when it comes to the premise, but there are good and bad qualities pertaining to being unrealistic one must compare to understand what I mean. Cat woman cyborg hybrids and talking dogs with Hawaiian shirts and sunglasses can be charming and creative additions to a game, but when you attempt to create a game or really any media that is both funny and serious, there had to be a good balancing act taking place. Most of the time, the game does a great job, but sometimes, it misses and I was left with either a bad taste in my mouth or just bored and uninvolved.

During the game, there will be very eventful days and some throwaway ones. Since the game is focused on the rather mundane goal of being able to afford a porn subscription (yes, that is the first primary objective) and ultimately pay your rent, the ending feels rather anticlimactic as a result. Even though there is a main plot point that takes hold around the halfway point which gives the player a look further into the protagonist's  past and present personal life and this leads the rest of the story to this specific concluding point, the point still stands that this piece can lack direction at times. Now, if you have seen any type of story in which this type of character development takes place (meaning the one [i]Jill[/i], the protagonist, faces), you won't really get that much more out of the way this story goes through the same motions, especially because it doesn't try to do anything but the bare minimum to get across its message. Some other characters fell flat for me as well, such as [i]Dana[/i], the boss, and [i]Gillian[/i], your co-bartender, leaving two core characters I was supposed to be acquainted with not fulfilling their purpose, which is rather disappointing in its own right.

Besides these two main gripes, though, I really did have a good time with this game. It surprised me in some ways that I didn't really expect and made up for its flaws in other ways, such as the brilliant art design, sound direction, and character interaction. A lot can be forgiven since it is not supposed to be some brilliant or profound work, which is why I only really fault it for what it lacks as far as the [i]Slice of Life[/i] and [i]Visual Novel[/i] genres go because that is what it is at its core. [i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] is a quaint and heartfelt hybrid that is worthwhile to play through, even if it may not seem life your type of game, as it is more mature than many of its contemporaries and makes an attempt at being human even when dealing with a cybernetic and perhaps even dystopian future.

I actually wrote the top half of this review before completing all the chapters... and lemme tell you... I didn't expect to be this emotionally affected by the end of it. What a brilliant story, and I'm not gonna lie, even the annoying parts had me laughing out loud because they were so cleverly meta."
There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension,Casual,1240210,I enjoyed the game. The puzzles are good and not too hard. The story and comedy were solid.
There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension,Casual,1240210,"In [i]There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension[/i], you play as a User who is attempting to play a video game only to be dissuaded by the narrator, known only as The Game, who says that there is in fact no game and the User should just do something else. The User attempts to do an end-run around The Game which only unleashes a glitch in the programming and sets the duo off on a bizarre, meta, and comedic adventure through gaming.

This game is an expansion of the short and similarly titled [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1241700/There_Is_No_Game_Jam_Edition_2015/]There Is No Game[/url][/i] (2015). It is mainly a comedy type game parodying video gaming while also containing several puzzles to solve.

To start with one of the best aspects of this game, the art used is excellent throughout. The style throughout most of the game is stylized pixel art. I found that the art was beautifully done in all respects not just for the main scenes of the game, but it also nails different styles of art from the games it parodies from the 1990s. The game's creators really did a great job of mostly sticking to pixel art, but using it in a variety of creative ways to create different types of scenes.

The sound design works quite well in multiple respects, too. The music in the game is a joy to listen to. As with the artwork, there are many types of musical tracks depending on the section of the game from a heartfelt song about love and loss to a hilarious rap track. The sound in the game is bolstered by the excellent narration work done by Pascal Cammisotto playing The Game and a few other characters as well (and who also was a writer).

The real meat of this game would be the writing and story. As mentioned above, this is mainly a comedy and parody game. I will try to avoid spoilers here as it is best to go into the game knowing little for the fullest enjoyment. I will say that the writing and experience of the game is quite enjoyable. At its core, the game is essentially a parody of video games much in the same vein as [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/221910/The_Stanley_Parable]The Stanley Parable[/url][/i] (2013). Indeed, it seems that [i]There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension[/i] took much inspiration from [i]The Stanley Parable[/i] from the over-the-top narrator frustrating or being frustrated by the human player to the meta humor and commentary on video gaming as a medium. Suffice it to say that if you liked the type of humor and writing in a game like [i]The Stanley Parable[/i], you will enjoy [i]There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension[/i].

In addition to the meta-humor, the game nails its parodies of video games themselves taking a good amount of inspiration from games of the 1990s. These parodies include a sequence based on LucasArts adventure games such as [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/388210/Day_of_the_Tentacle_Remastered/]Day of the Tentacle[/url][/i] (1993) and some of the earlier titles of [i]The Legend of Zelda[/i] series. The game does a good job of evoking the styles, including art and sound, of these games.

While mostly a comedic game, this also contains many puzzles to solve to progress the story. I found that the puzzles were enjoyable and not so difficult as to be aggravating. The game does have a built-in hint system if you truly get stuck while the narration will offer a few subtle clues to push you in the right direction. Some of the puzzles were definitely on the easier side, though, so if you really want to play this specifically for the puzzles, you may be disappointed.

Overall, I really enjoyed what this game had to offer with its bizarre and meta sense of humor, stunning graphics, and enjoyable music. I only scratched the surface with the type of writing to expect in this game as there is much to discover. I would recommend this game to those looking for something comedic with some puzzle solving along the way."

Kind Words (lo fi chill beats to write to),Casual,1070710,"[b]Kind Words[/b] isn't a game, per se. 
It's a lot more.
It's an anonymous network that allows people from all over the world to share their woes, or hear a kind word or two to brighten up their day.
I need to seriously define this right away: 
[b]This game is NOT a source of professional mental help, and must not be treated as such.[/b]
This is a way to express your current feelings/worries, be it happyness or apathy, but it nonetheless provides a way to find professional support easier -- there are several sources listed in this game, and should a request be beyond one's competence, you can always report it as ""Worrying"" to have the game's moderators send a list of helpful sources to the person in question.
Still -- it's a pleasing little zen-microcosm with a warm and endearing colour palette, and a lovely soundtrack composed by Clark Aboude.
And it's a place you can always turn to when you just need to hear an uplifting word or two. There's people from all walks of life here, and if you have a problem, you can surely at least discuss it here.
Whatever the case, someone in Kind Words is always all-ears. As an exception to what you may expect from the Internet, the letters here are sincere, genuine, even heartfelt. The friendly community that this game has created given its complete anonymity is nothing short of a wonder.
Sadly, there's the odd outliers every once in a while, but they're definitely a minority. There's so many nice people here that you'll be surprised -- I sure was. These people helped me out immensely with things I'd find hard to even spill to people I hold closest.
Still, as said before:

Kind Words (lo fi chill beats to write to),Casual,1070710,"Kind Words made me feel very special when I first launched it. I had never seen a place on the Internet where everyone was so nice and friendly while also remaining completely anonymous. Most of us know from first-hand experience that anonymity tends to bring forth the worst in people, but something about this app keeps the vile and the bitter at bay. Suffice it to say that I [i]almost[/i] shed a single manly tear while going through paper aeroplane letters with simple encouragements and words of wisdom. This was a special moment; I was thinking to myself that I'd found the ultimate way of spending my free time – writing supportive letters to strangers, asking for advice and guidance myself, using screensavers with chill lo-fi music while I'm working or studying. However, what felt like love turned out to be a mere infatuation that died as quickly as it had come – four hours later it was gone without a trace. If you look at other reviewers, you will notice a similar trend.

[h1]Why?[/h1]

Well, ask yourself: [b]do you [i]actually[/i] need Kind Words?[/b] I mean, have you got something gnawing away at your heart, something that keeps you awake at night, the burden you want to get off your chest? Maybe the stuff that you wouldn't share with your dearest friend or even your loved ones for fear of judgement or ridicule? Do you have any mental health issues; are you depressed? If so, then this application might be just the right thing for you, and it's the main reason I recommend it. However, I'm happy to say that I don't really need any help or words of support; I'm doing all right, have been for a long time now, and I'm planning to keep it that way. The only option for me (and for many of you as well, I suppose) would then be to respond to requests submitted by those whom I described above. This might be very rewarding for a couple of hours and you might feel like you're actually making a bit of a difference, but...
[list]

[*]...the requests are a mess. [i]""What's your favourite band/videogame/book?"", ""Tell me about something good/bad that happened to you today"", ""I want stickers, send me stickers!"", ""Tell me a joke – looking to laugh out loud!""[/i] – these are so common that sifting through the list gets a bit frustrating at times. People forget that Kind Words is not supposed to be a run-of-the-mill chat app, but a safe space for those who are struggling. Problems don't end there; if you are hurting and you want to submit a request, you're only allowed to do so in a very limited number of lines. This drives many people to send multiple requests as parts of one story and give them numbers: 1/3, 2/3, 3/3... Unfortunately, you view a random selection of requests in no particular order, and oftentimes stumble upon a ""2/3"" with no way of knowing what the person is talking about as there is no way to read neither the beginning nor the end of it;

[*]...your letters can only be 14 lines long, and the influence of this limitation is tremendous. I understand that the developers made a conscious choice here and I see why they would do that – no need to write a scientific thesis in reply to a simple request asking for a piece of advice – but what I've found is that this restriction kills the uniqueness of each letter and stifles its potential impact. Most things you'll send are bound to be generic [i]""Don't worry, it'll be all right"".[/i] [u]The person who's hurting is not allowed to express their feelings completely,[/u] thus forced to send multiple requests and have their voices not be heard, and [u]you're barely able to offer anything other than a few watery clichés,[/u] those hang ons and stay strongs, with very few exceptions.
[/list]

By and large, if you're doing fine and life is good, Kind Words will test the very nature of your supposed altruism. Are you able to put up with these things that turned me away so fast? Maybe. But I still think that if you want to [b][i]give[/i][/b], you also need to be able to [b][i]receive[/i][/b] in return – at least that's how I believe it works with most people. Only replying to requests and not leaving any will create an imbalance, the feeling of an annoying chore which is bound to get old fairly quickly, and the issues I told you about won't make it any easier. Keep this in mind when you decide to purchase. 

However, if it takes everything that you have to face the day, if you feel like a disappointment, if your heart is broken, if your loved one is sick – there is probably no better virtual place you can be, even with all its shortcomings. Nothing beats professional help, of course, but Kind Words comes to your aid if seeking counsel is not an option.

It's not a long game but it sure is a roller coaster of emotions the entire time.

House Flipper,Casual,613100,i love this game but you need to add more houses to flip
House Flipper,Casual,613100,"Look, I really like this game. Its a mild experience, something to just mindlessly play and easy to pick up and put down. It has a lot of strengths, letting you express a sizable amount of freedom in what you make, it has a lot of options and props for you to choose from when building, and you really can do a lot with what you have. 

It needs a lot of polish though. There have been several dlcs, and a new one on the way. But there are still a lot of bugs in the base game. Sometimes the game just... stops working for me, ill be playing it and then lose the ability to do everything until I close it down and reopen it, sometimes losing a lot of progress, sometimes only a little. There are a lot of attention to detail things that really bother me, like when plastering tiles the serrations in the grout are the wrong way than what you stroke. It seems lazy. When you're planting multiple plants in the garden dlc, after you have dug to the bottom of any of the holes, you automatically put the shovel away and have to take the shovel out if you want to keep digging. This, combined with other mildly infuriating things upsets me, content is nice, but it seems to be quantity over quality and its getting kind of frustrating, especially since there is more on the way. 

I really think this game could benefit a lot from having the same level of care put into the appearance as someone playing it might put into their home."

House Flipper,Casual,613100,"this game is just, wow. the words i have to describe the game are just endless. i mean this wholeheartedly, this game is worth it. everything in it just captivates me till ive been on it for hours and dont even realize it. from the cleaning of the windows to the painting of the walls, i feel 100% entranced in this game. the graphics are phenomenal and the various situations and jobs you are tasked to do with are so unique and well thought out. this game will exceed all your expectations i guarantee you. not only that but theyre also constantly adding new things and changing the game so you never finish it completely. i give all my kudos to the game developers because they really outdid themselves with this one. i am absolutely in love with this game and would do anything for it. ive recommended it to friends and theyve also had an extremely positive reaction to it. if youre on the fence about this game heres your sign, get it. its so worth it if you enjoy cleaning and decoration or if you just want something to do to pass your time because i will tell you from firsthand experience that it will fulfill your needs in both categories."

Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I love this game. But it's not a city builder. 
It's a tile placing puzzler with rural landscape as its setting. 

Dont get me wrong. I'm hooked. But if you're looking for a city builder this isnt it.

This is carcasonne and Islanders smooshed together, which are also two of my favourite games. 

And while I can and have spent hours playing this little gem, I'd love to see more tile variety eventually, like carcasonne expansions. 

Thank you developers for this great little creation."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Experience the euphoria of creation in this high-octane, top-down build-'em-up. Contend with the ever-more-extreme demands of the Brandenburg Rural Development Committee for yet more lush wheatfields, serene forests, and cozy woodland hamlets, all to feed the insatiable hunger of the German peace machine. Deploy the hexagon, nature's perfect shape, to construct a sprawling network of countryside fixtures. Erect dread monuments to your terrible might, such as the Maze of Endless Maize and the Three-Tile Circular Railroad To Absolutely Nowhere. Learn to fear and respect the hidden power of the otherwise-innocuous river, as its conniving curves and bewildering bends ruin round after round after raging, tearful round. Experience the nail-biting thrill of wondering if the tile you need for that one spot you've left vacant for the entire game even exists in the first place. Realise that it doesn't. Lose. Quit the game in childish fury. Come back for more.

This game has it all. If you don't buy it, then your brain is stupid."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Pros: 
- Relaxing atmosphere is perfectly executed
- sound effects are varied and delightful
- music is great
- plenty of strategy and planning involved, despite the simple appearance
- hexagons

Cons:
- I found the learning curve a little frustrating for ~30 minutes because I didn't understand the differences between the 3 kinds of quests. But a little reading outside of the game fixed that for me, and now I find it quite a nice system. So maybe I just didn't pay enough attention to the tutorial. 

This game is great."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,This is the perfect chill game to pass time during boring work meetings!
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,I put tiles together and my brain likes it a lot
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Awesome puzzle game that is very simple by its rules and limitations, but at the same time there is this underlying challenge that requires finesse. Getting high score isn't that easy, took me 5 hours of playing before even getting above 5000 points! (I know this doesnt mean anything to you unless you have played)

Loop is simple: you have limited amount of tiles and you get more by placing perfect pieces and completing quests that come with tiles (and few from the map as they spawn through your game). Controlling the map space from the get go is important, as you want to start zoning different areas from the first moments! Keeping that up is the key, and also do not limit your options by for example colliding big city's space with your farmlands.

Great little game. Definately worth its price."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Dorfromantik is a casual tile-based landscape building puzzler with soothing music and pleasing visuals.  You place hexagonal tiles from a randomized ""deck"" of tiles and try to match up elements (farmland, houses, trees, waterways, and railways) to satisfy size requirements that are associated with random tiles in the deck.  When you meet a requirement, you get more tiles added to your deck, and when the deck is empty the game ends.  The trailer on Steam explains the game perfectly and after watching it you pretty much know what to expect from the game.  By the end of the run, the rules of the game cause a pleasantly complex landscape to emerge, with towns, railways, farms, and rivers with boats.  

This game has a lot in common with the also very excellent casual city-building game ""Islanders"", to the point where I'm almost certain the two games share developers in common - although the publisher of this game on Steam is different.  The music, scoring system, progression, and even the voice narrating the trailer are so similar that I'm convinced it's the same people.  

Despite being simple, learning how to progress in the game can get fairly complex, as you learn more about how the different kinds of tiles fit together and the ""meta"" of the game (best practices for where to put certain types of tiles to prevent blocking yourself later).  Like Islanders, the game is simple but not easy.  Accessible without being shallow. 

This is a solid full-price purchase if you appreciate a chilled-out puzzle experience with consistent and pleasing aesthetics, or if you enjoyed the game ""Islanders"".  If you're looking for more of a management simulation city-builder, the complexity is not there in this game but it's still worth playing for the novel puzzling aspects, clean design, and excellent music and visuals."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Bought it four hours before it got 20% off and it was worth all the money.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"An oddly addictive game that strikes the right chords of building puzzler and casual strategy. It also has nothing to do with Romantic Dwarf's. It's hard to describe this game, it's a solid chill yet challenging game experience for those who enjoy a causal puzzle that can get complex quick. The game plays like a more in depth Islanders, with a bit more challenge as well. One of the strengths of this game is how much time travel you will do when you zone in and it's 3 hours later on a match end. I'm an avid Sim City fan & collector and this hits me in a place I wasn't even entirely sure I had anymore with the general placement and development of your layouts. I am very curious to watch this ""Minimalistic city builder"" genre develop. 

This is one of those casual, chill types of games you throw on before bed or during some downtime and just zone out to. Well worth your time if you're into the gameplay videos or have played Islanders and really vibed with it. I just wish they had dark mode cause holy hell does that background start to burn your eyes after 3 hours. Now to just figure out how to get passed 11k on the scores."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"Perfect relaxing/chill puzzle game. Though it's listed to be an early access game, it already feels complete.

PS to devs: Your facebook ads worked! :)"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"TL;DR - Not a bad game, but even for a lightweight city builder, it feels lacking in depth. 

After having fallen into an obsession with the similar lightweight city-builder Islanders, I thought this would be a great companion game. However, DorfRomantic feels inferior to it in most respects. This isn't to say that the game is bad in and of itself, but it feels underwhelming in comparison. As a lightweight, low-stress, affordable, visually appealing game, it's perfectly serviceable. But Islanders does all that and provides interesting gameplay, which DorfRomantic doesn't quite deliver on. Specific pain points are listed below. 
[list]

[*] The terrain features don't really interact in any interesting ways - in fact, most of the goals provided incentivize lumping all the similar features together in big blobs, which gets pretty boring. There's no incentive to place farms near towns, or woods next to rail lines, or any interesting buildings except the Rail Station (a hybrid Water/Rail tile with very lenient placement requirements).

[*] Besides the aforementioned Rail Station, pretty much all the unlocks are cosmetic only. The Windmill is just a reskinned farm tile, boats and trains are just kinda there but don't do anything, and the different biomes don't impact gameplay. This isn't bad in and of itself, but the lack of interesting mechanics means that there's not much incentive to actually push for achievements or challenges.

[*] The hex grid is very limiting in terms of placement. New tiles have to be placed adjacent to existing ones. There's many times where you'll get a tile that doesn't really do anything for your current plans. So instead of throwing a useless tile to the side or putting it in storage, you are forced to slap it down someplace random and just hope it works out and doesn't screw you somewhere down the line. 

[*] Water and Rail tiles have restrictions on where they can be placed and what can connect to them, meaning you start to dread seeing those tiles show up in your stack. There's been times where water or rail has blocked otherwise good plays. Instead of giving an opportunity to adjust your strategy or try something new, you instead feel screwed over when forced to place them. When I start actively disliking 2 out of the game's 5 terrain features, I feel like that's a problem. 

[*] Numerous times I've placed a tile and realized it didn't connect in the way I wanted or there was a better placement/rotation somewhere else, but there's no undo option and I just have to live with my failure or torpedo the town entirely.
[/list]
I understand that this is an Early Access game, and additional content is slated for the game. If content comes down that addresses some of these issues, this game will be great, especially at this price point. But for now, Islanders does more for me than DorfRomantic."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,10/10 The little boats are animated and move throughout their given terrain. More of this please
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I BARELY recommend.. It lacks a LOT in the point/reward/unlock system to keep me wanting to play over and over again. Even when taking the time to make perfect matches every single time to maximize ""Perfect"" placement, you are at the mercy of the random tile generator to keep the game going without depleting your moves, which isn't very long at all. Skill should keep the game going, not random chance of the tile generator stealing away my dopamine kick and leaving me feeling disappointed in the gameplay mechanics. There is no point in trying to beat a previous score if it doesn't rely at least MOSTLY on skill to get the score!

I like the game.... It has potential to be something really good!.... but right now it's a ""Fun At First"" game that loses it's replay appeal a little too quickly.

Skill based unlockables for score multipliers or other bonuses would be a nice added feature.... Maybe ""Natural Disasters"" that negatively affect your score and multipliers which could also reduce the number of tiles on the screen making it more skill-based to increase the size of your kingdom and gain more points. Your ""Enemy"" could be the elements causing the disaster. Something to outwit skillfully to keep the game going. 

More modes!... a ""Beat the clock"" mode would be cool, Multi player for competition, Creative mode is okay, but meh.... 

I know some of my ideas kill the ""Relaxing"" humdrum type feel that is hyped as a core feature of the gameplay.... But casually placing little tiles until the random tile generator has decided you are entitled to go no further gets super old super fast!

UPDATE.... Never mind... I see the developers are satisfied and consider the game complete... So I had to change my vote from recommend to NOT recommend. This game will most likely remain a ""Fun at first"" novelty that quickly devolves into a ""Why am I doing this"" task.

“We are a small team of 4 Game Design students and have set ourselves a clear goal with Dorfromantik for the year 2021. We are happy with the current core gameplay mechanics and don't want to make any more big changes to it."""
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"During messy times, it's nice to have a simple and friendly looking game to simply relax. I've only played it for a few minutes, and it helped me release much stress."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"I only played this game once so far, and it was already well worth the $8.

This game is charming, soothing, artful. It feels like playing a board game like Settlers kind of, only you get animated countrysides and soundtrack. And there's no resource management really, but you do have to keep track of branching patterns in the map for forests, rivers, fields etc. It was designed by game dev students in Berlin...indie gem <3"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"It's a cute and colourful game, with lots of potential. It's not a city building game, but more like a tile puzzle placement game. It's very addicting and satisfying (my smol brain likes it when the tiles are matching like I want).
However, some upcoming tiles may be random and can f*ck up your landscape, leading to its end or ruining your ideas.
Besides this, it's worth to play it even at full price, and it's so good when you earn achievements.
Can't wait to see the next updates and improvements of this game soon!"
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,Awesome game. My only regret is that it doesn't have hill and mountain tiles.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,I think this will be one of my favorite games to just chill to for quite a while.
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"This is the perfect ""relax in the evening"" game that I've been looking for. It doesn't take too much concentration for my over-tired brain, if played casually, but it also isn't mindless clicking. It's beautiful to look at. I love seeing the little trains and boats moving through the landscape. It's a very engaging game and I always want to play just a little bit longer. It runs perfectly on my Linux laptop via Proton."
Dorfromantik,Casual,1455840,"It's like Islanders but an even stronger dose of ambien. I streamed it for my wife and she immediately fell asleep. 10/10

Going into a little more detail, like every other review says it's a ""city builder"" plop-down-tiles puzzle game. Get the right adjacencies in the right number for more tiles and points and more dopamine and more tiles and even more points and more dopamine. Very, very chill vibes. Probably not a game to play if you're *not* wanting to be relaxed. If a chill adjacency/type tile puzzle is what you're after, though, this definitely has Islanders beat IMO.

Initially I was wondering why it was called ""Dorfromantik"" after booting it up and now I'm under the impression that's the brand name of the sleep aid the company behind this game is manufacturing."

Wobbly Life,Casual,1211020,"I really enjoy this game very much. It's one of the games which are suitable for kids and adults.
There's a lot of stuff to explore and you can easily spend your time fooling around with friends or do jobs together like delivering pizza and stuff to collect money and buy clothes, pets, houses or cars and stuff.
Would be cool if there would be an option to disable the timelimit when doing jobs, so younger kids could enjoy them too.
There are also cool achievements and great puzzles to be solved. So many secrets to explore... ! Thumbs up!

ATRI -My Dear Moments-,Casual,1230140,"[h1]Story[/h1]
In the distant future, an unexplained event has left the world facing a rise in sea elevation which has left a large portion of the population underwater. In a town that is being slowly enveloped by the rising water, we have [b]Natsuki[/b], the main protagonist who is seeking to find money so that he can buy a cybernetic leg to replace his aging prosthetic that has begun to wear out.

[b]Natsuki[/b] knowing about a secret treasure that his grandmother has kept for years heads down into the water towards her now submerged house in search of this mysterious treasure. The treasure that he ends up finding turns out to be a humanoid android who goes by the name of [b]Atri[/b].

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]An amazing story with great characters that are well crafted
[*]Multiple choices that lead to different endings
[*]Beautiful anime art style brimming with life in a post-apocalyptic setting
[*]Fantastic soundtrack that is pleasing to the ears with its piano tunes
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]The pacing at times can be slow
[*]There are only three segments where your choices matter
[*]I would have liked to see more world-building
[/list]

[h1]What I liked from the story[/h1]
The story is presented very well and I loved the setting that was shown. An unexplained sea rise has left most of the population underwater with the remaining people left holding onto nothing more but a slither of hope. 

[b]Natsuki[/b] lives in a small town that doesn't even have power with the exception of a few areas. I liked how the VN showed us how generators work when used with water to make electricity.  They use this electricity to power only a few lights, yet the townspeople are overjoyed by this miracle of light further emphasizing the type of reality that they are in.

The story can get emotional with a few of the themes that it tackles and you may find yourself deeply caring for an android after seeing her perspectives about the world around her. You may never want that feeling to go away as it feels life-changing. Sometimes a new perspective can be very enlightening, and for me, this was very refreshing to get from a visual novel.

At certain points, you can choose between dialogue options which will determine the ending that you will get. There are three endings you can obtain in total, a good, bad, and true ending. In order to unlock the true ending, you will have to complete the good and bad endings first.

[h1]Problems with the story[/h1]
I did have some issues with the pacing as it felt slow where the story just seemed to drag on. This mainly appeared in the middle of the story and I felt that some of the things mentioned were unnecessary and could have easily been left out.

The one thing that helps to make it redeemable is that the characters are very likeable preventing it from being a total drag. I also would have liked to see more dialogue options as we are limited to only three for the entire story. I think having more options would have made the slower parts more interesting and would help make the characters feel more alive.

World-building is another area that I would have liked to see more of as what they do have is quite interesting. I wanted to know how other countries reacted to the world being flooded and how they survived up to this point.

[h1]Characters[/h1]
We are in the shoes of [b]Natsuki[/b] and he just wants to live a normal life. He is a high school dropout, who was forced out as he could no longer afford his tuition fees. He thought he had nobody to turn to for help until he met [b]Atri[/b], who changed his life for the better, helping him find meaning in his life. He will help others when the time comes and can be quite caring for other people. [b]Natsuki[/b] is currently motivated to find money as he has a prosthetic leg that is in need of a replacement.

[b]Atri[/b] is a cute android that will help [b]Natsuki[/b] with some of his daily needs. She also wants to learn about the world around her and discover new things about herself and people. It’s like watching someone grow up as a child, where they see the whole world differently than adults do. She will show emotions in certain situations, react to certain people, and may end up defending [b]Narsuki[/b] from trouble. She helps him cook and generally takes care of him saying that she is [b]Natsuki’s[/b] new leg since he has difficulty doing certain things and is not the best at taking care of himself.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2509885084
[b]Ryuuiji[/b] is a character that surprised me by how well done he is as a character who develops throughout the story. I loved his personality as he is chill when you get to know him and he also helps [b]Natsuki[/b]. At first, he came off as a character who did not want to be bothered with but redeemed himself throughout the story. [b]Ryuuji[/b] turned out to be my favorite character, plus he knows guitar so that’s an added bonus.

[h1]Graphics, soundtrack, and performance[/h1]
The art style is really beautiful. I loved the amount of detail that was put into it and how well-drawn both the characters and environments are. It was made by the same developers who worked on If My Heart Had Wings which had some of the best graphics that I have seen in a visual novel. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2497271742
The soundtrack is another thing I found great and well-executed. The piano tunes are very soothing to listen to and never distract from the scene. Everything runs smoothly and I experienced no issues with it. I played on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, with16 GB of RAM.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
If you are looking for a good emotional story, then [b]Atri: My Dear Moments[/b] is highly recommended. It will take you on an interesting rollercoaster in a world that is barely hanging onto a sliver of hope. The characters take the front stage and are really what makes this visual novel so interesting and is perfect for anyone who likes slice-of-life kind of stories.

       Clicker Heroes is a great background game or a game to play when your watching tv. At first it is very easy to progress and it becomes much faster once you get a couple of Hero Souls by Ascending. There is alot more strategy than one might expect from a free game. You must decide who to upgrade, which skills to buy, which things to spend you Hero Souls on, which things to spend your Ancient Souls on, when to Ascend, when to Transcend, which heroes to Gild, what missions to send your mercenary, to revive or bury your mercenary, which clan to join, and much more! A great game to just waste some time without spending money. It's free, why not give it a try?

Maybe even a daylight cycle instead of choosing the daylight and it being constant.  maybe have an option to change the speed at which day and night cycles.  Why not add in weather at the same time. Why not instead of an infinite expanse of water have a procedurally generated planet that one could build on.  Maybe there are some people that would prefer it the way it is and that could be toggled on and off whichever way the player prefers to play.  These are some of the ideas that I notice and can't help but feel like the true potential of this game is barely being scratched."
Townscaper,Casual,1291340,"I love this game! For four reasons:

1. I bought this game to relax. Instead, it made me concentrate! But this kind of concentration is so relaxing, I don't mind...
2. The colours and shapes are so pretty, that what I build feels like it belongs in Heaven. Or Paradise. Or (insert name of a nice place in the afterlife here)
3. I Love art! Unfortunately, I'm so bad at it, I can't even draw an oval without it looking all wonky. How does this game make me feel like I'm a genius architect, is beyond me...
4. I have only been playing for 45 minutes so far, but managed to make a little neighbourhood where every house looks too pretty to demolish. And then I discovered that the game autosaves my progress as well!

What are you waiting for? Buy it!"
Townscaper,Casual,1291340,"meh. The price of 5€ doesent seem worth it.
As you see in the Screenshots you can create some really nice Towns but I personally lack the creativity.
All my buildings look similar and I feel dissapointed.
definetly not the games fault tho.
If youre an creative person who likes town buildings this little game is definetly great for you and good to kill time.

But it simply isnt my kind of game.

Townscaper,Casual,1291340,"The game is great for being early access, it brings a special feeling of relaxation, although I wish they'd a options for extra props like people, fish etc to add a greater feeling to the game, also adding some calming ambient music or sounds. The whole building feature is simple, you place but the fact that the thing you place is different depending on where adds so many combos. I wish they would add the feature drag to place to make it easier to place in larger areas or fill as it would make the building aspect easier and therefore making it relaxing instead of being bored of placing so many buildings. But all of that may be added as it is still Early Access, even if they don't, I'm in love"

Townscaper,Casual,1291340,Its like crack. Please help.
Townscaper,Casual,1291340,"The game is worth it for only $5.99. It's pretty cool building complex houses, and structures, but the game gets boring real quick. Sometimes if I get bored from doing other things, I will play this game for like 15 minutes or so.

Townscaper,Casual,1291340,"This is a very fun and relaxing toy, for a few dollars you can have a really nice low effort way to spend the time that also has a surprising amount of depth despite its price. It isn't a city manager, you build your city as a piece of art more so than for the challenge of creating a functional city. You make your city how you like and for the money, this is a great deal. It might not be what you spend doing every night, but you certainly can, because I have already. If this were priced for $10 I'd still be happy with my purchase, although I'd have a much harder time recommending it, but for $6, this is a perfectly reasonable price for a very clean and well thought out ""toy"" moreso than a game, but one which you can still get hours of enjoyment out of. 

It isn't challenging per se, but it takes time and effort to learn the intricacies and details to get things to be perfect or ideal. I think this is a great way for city building junkies to relax and unwind, maybe listen to a podcast or tv show while playing and just take it easy, maybe use it as a way to take breaks between work or studying. I recommend this product very highly so long as one understands what he's getting, which is a fun and relaxing toy, not a full city management game, since there is no management function whatsoever."

DJMAX RESPECT V,Sports,960170,"New players BEWARE!

There are a lot of other negative reviews of this game, and I think they're all very spot on, but I want to touch on something that not many folks here in the reviews are mentioning which is:

This game is incredibly anti-newcomer. Yes, it looks pretty. Yes, it looks assessable... but beware, because if you purchase this game as a person new to rhythm games looking to get better at them, then you're in the wrong place and you better reconsider and look at playing a free alternative(like OSU!Mania). 

This is the biggest thing that bugs me about DJMAX.

It's honestly such a slap in the face when you come to realization that the only way you can even hope to get better at the game is to stagnantly repeat songs in freestyle that you're comfortable with and slowly move up. Yes, you do get better over time, but I have to argue here that this isn't any effective nor efficient training for the time and effort you put in. NO player wants to feel like they're stuck in a game since that would defeat the purpose of a game being a game, and lol guess what, neowiz is doing exactly that for the newcomers

There's absolutely no way to practice this game efficiently. If you find a song that has only a really hard part towards the end of the track then guess what, you're outta luck. You can play freestyle mode and just keep failing until you get it sometime in the uncertain future I guess... If you really want to practice that part then you'd have to go search YT videos and tap along to a video which I find to be completely inconvenient. Air mode is also a 'no fail' mode, BUT you can't really choose a song you want. And online player lobbies are good option as it is a no fail mode, but you kinda need friends, and I have none :(

All the options I listed above are just not convenient or efficient at all. When I say ""practice/train"", I mean that I would like to sit down and hard practice complex patterns on very low BPM(not low note speed) and slowly raise it until I get it embedded into my muscle memory, and it really frustrates me that I'm not able to have the convenience of a training mode that could really facilitate more motivation and time spent playing the game. Even free games like OSU!Mania has the song map editor where you can actually slow down the BPM of a track to practice, I don't see why a paid game cant include this simple feature as well.

It's funny ya know, you would think an online only game like DJMAX would have more than just pretty colors/anime/weeb art to attract casual players like simply including an effective way to practice would be a good start to help bring more revenue, recognition, and a bigger playerbase to this already niche genre...

Maybe they should've thought about this instead of focusing on an useless ranked mode(that no one plays btw) and shoving xigncode3 down our throats...

Outside of this, it's a good game really, but I think the game has like no replay value at all if you aren't very good at rhythm games to begin with.

"
DJMAX RESPECT V,Sports,960170,"Very good game, it's really fun and I would recommend it!
Although I think it's too expensive compared too other rythm games, especially osu mania, and I do think there's better rythm games overall. So I would give it a 6 or a 7 out of 10."
DJMAX RESPECT V,Sports,960170,"Very good DJMAX game and the online ranked matches are fun and works great!

STORY OF SEASONS: Friends of Mineral Town,Casual,978780,"I've been giving this another go after playing it on Switch and being too disappointed and underwhelmed by it to continue. I will state upfront that I never played Mineral Town on the Game Boy Advance back when it was still under the Harvest Moon name, so it's not scratching that nostalgia itch the way it would for fans of the original and that's likely heavily effecting my experience. All that said, after giving it another chance, I've come to the conclusion that it is a decent game. I was able to get some enjoyment out of it, it just doesn't hold a candle to the previous two for me personally. I would probably give it a ""mixed"" rating if it were available, but with my own bias in mind, and again, not having played the original, I decided to go with a thumbs up with some big caveats.

The first two Story of Seasons are among my all-time favorite games, second only to Rune Factory 4. Having played all four Story of Seasons titles, there has been a noticeable (and in my opinion, negative) change in tone and style compared to the previous two, the first in particular. It's more compact, less detailed, and the world and characters just feel sterile in comparison, which is depressing considering how pretty the 3DS games were and what they could have achieved visually on a more powerful console, but didn't. The first game in particular dealt with heavy topics; the town [spoiler]grieving together after losing a long-time resident,[/spoiler] animals falling ill and dying of old age or if not cared for properly, elements which in this game appear to have either been glossed over or removed entirely.

My biggest issue with Mineral town is a somewhat subjective and arguably a shallow one, but it bothered me immensely nonetheless. While I know this is a remake, as mentioned before, there's been a [i]drastic[/i] shift in art direction since the first Story of Seasons game, particularly the portraits, which were much more painterly and detailed, and much less bobble-headed in previous games. As a visual novel junkie, portraits have always made a massive difference in immersion for me, and while the character sprites and portraits in this series have always been on the cutesy side and not completely proportionate, for me they still managed to strike a good balance between being cute yet able to be taken seriously when needed. This installment feels like they just grabbed the chibidometer and cranked it up to eleven to unsettling effect. It's a look that bugs me a lot less and I think can work well in titles like Animal Crossing, but in a game where you're procreating with the human townsfolk, it just doesn't do it for me and greatly detracted from my experience. Even the animal models look less appealing (cows in particular went from cute and stylized to big marshmallowy blobs barely resembling bovines) and this isn't just true of the Mineral Town remake; it's something they carried over to Olive Town, too. I really hope they eventually return to the old style, but if the most recent game is anything to go by, we'll be lucky if future games [i]get character portraits at all[/i]. While I didn't like the portrait style of this game, I'll still take it over the cold, soulless 3D stares of Olive Town any day. To me, Mineral Town marks the point where the series started taking a nosedive, and it's a little heartbreaking.

One significant improvement that I do want to give Mineral Town credit for is the addition of same-sex marriage. Bachelors and bachelorettes are no longer gender-locked or relegated to being ""best friends"". You're free to romance them all with your protagonist of choice, and even if you prefer one demographic over the other, it's still nice to be able to see everyone's stories without having to start an entire new game to do so.

Despite my issues with it, Mineral Town isn't a bad game in and of itself. Style and tone aside, the core mechanics remain largely the same, so it's still a solid farming/life sim that's sure to be loved by fans of its Harvest Moon predecessor, but if you're buying it as a die-hard fan of the first two Story of Seasons games like me, you may want to taper your expectations before diving in."

SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated,Casual,969990,"I'm saying yes, I'd recommend this game, but there are a lot of flaws that I'd like to talk about as well. If i could give a ""Maybe"" recommendation, I would honestly do just that. But let me go through all the pros and cons.

Pros:
-Visually, the game looks great. It's bright and colorful and looks very modernized compared to the original.
-Gameplay is pretty smooth overall, platforming mechanics and combat are textbook for a 3D platformer.
-Remastered soundtracks. Yes, YES, YESSS!!!
-Glitches that are good for speedrunning.

Cons:
-Main boss fights are awful. Two of the four were ruined in almost all ways (Robo-Pat and Robo-Spongebob's Brain along with Robo-Plankton), one was slightly improved (Robo-Sandy), and one was basically unchanged. (Robo-Spongebob)
-Glitches that are bad... in general.
-Overhyped. Nostalgia trip just wasn't there. As I was playing I just wanted to go back and play the original. (which is exactly what I did).
-The game is more aimed towards kids. When I say this, I'm mostly referring to gameplay, level design, and boss fights. Everything is ten times easier than the original, which had some segments and a specific boss, Robot Patrick, that actually had quite a bit of difficulty behind them. This was basically thrown away entirely, and while this was an understandable decision, it's just more of a reason for people like me, who wanted to re-experience what I played when I was five, to steer away from this game and play the original again. That's why I'm considering this more of a con than a pro.

So... yeah. The game is good for kids, definitely. If you buy this game for your eight year old son, he'll get those classic jokes from when I used to watch Spongebob as a kid (which are much better than today's Spongebob Episodes), you'll probably find them glued to the damn screen. But for people like me, it just didn't hit me the way I wanted it to. I wouldn't necessarily say it was bad in any way, but it just didn't satisfy my hunger for the nostalgic feeling I was looking for, and I feel many would agree with me also.

SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated,Casual,969990,"This is one of the games that truly deserved a remaster and I can't tell you how many times I replayed the original version throughout my childhood, it was a lot and even now I consider it such a great childhood game- most importantly, one that stayed great into adulthood and is for all ages despite being Spongebob.
The difficulty of this game when I was younger was quite challenging at times, for a kid, obviously, and even now retains *some* of that difficulty for adults, even though yes I consider it an easy game, there are still parts of this that got me a little irritated- which is heavily encouraged by the way. No one likes a game that is too easy.
I knew of the release of the Rehydrated when it came out but put it off for a year because I ""didn't want to replay a Spongebob game"", for the most part, and while yeah, maybe some people won't want to replay it for Spongebob purposes, it is an extremely fun, beautiful, and incredible platformer game, one I put on practically the same level as A Hat In Time which I consider the best one out there!

First thing I noticed when playing this game was how truly great everything looked, which actually wasn't my original thought before playing it. I had actually almost criticised it before I played it, such as the screenshots of the game showed that it was honestly *too* bright. While some parts of this game are actually really bright, it is easy to overlook once you are in the game and I never found it to irritate me. It really does look 100x better while you're playing it, nonetheless you can always turn your brightness down so it is far from a complaint- the game is EXTREMELY well recreated and you can tell a LOT of effort went into this remaster, keeping it incredibly true to the original, changing nothing and improving absolutely everything. I even noticed some things I didn't in the original due to lack of detail or just overall graphic flaws in the old version.

I'm a completionist despite having no ""perfect games"" on Steam(believe me, I've tried and even practically gotten there twice on consoles), so a game that has an abundance (200+) achievements, and some being extremely and almost downright impossible to get, have a large tendency to turn me away from a game unless it's so good to the point I can overlook achievements. Even then I'm pretty content with having all achievements except 2 or 3 in games because it's close enough. The achievements in this game are quite literally perfect, although I woulds say there are no ""hard"" achievements, but that's also because this game is extremely do-able in terms of 100% completion which I aimed for the second I played this game.
I can't remember if it was in the original, but the fact you can track how many collectables you have in each ""area"", or should I say level, is perfect and spared me of insanity checking every level for everything I missed.

Overall this is a perfect remaster and I'm not sure what more to say besides that, it's definitely worth playing and my only complaint is the settings should have a lot more options than it does. It has quite a lot of playtime at I'm going to assume 15-20 hours depending on how good and fast you are and if you want 100% completion."

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,its ok
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"Alright, I've waited years to do this, and finally it's time to put forth a review here.

For context, Isaac was one of the two games (the other being Spelunky) that got me to dump AAA games and switch to almost exclusively playing indies (AAA games getting progressively more slimy and worthless also helped though).  That was the ORIGINAL Isaac, and it was seriously just THAT DARNED GOOD.  And then Rebirth came out and upgraded EVERYTHING.  Needless to say, this is by far one of my favorite games of all time.  Top 3, I'd say.  Considering I've been gaming since the days of the 2600... that's extremely high praise.

So yeah.  I like it.  But I'm going to do this review a bit different.  Instead of talking about what the game is like and all of that like I usually do, let's just go over some good/bad points, and maybe a bit about the expansions.

First, the good.  Well, there is a LOT of good here.  The design of basically everything is outright masterful, and there is an absolutely stupid amount of content here.  An absolutely astonishing number of items, enemies, bosses, areas, and so on.  Getting 1000+ hours out of this game isnt exactly unheard of, and it's very easy to see why.

What's more, despite the roguelike nature of it, Isaac is a skill-based game.  RNG cant kill you... unless you let it.  Skill, knowledge, and making good decisions... like any good roguelike, that's what wins runs for you here.  This is a game that gets it RIGHT.  ...Mostly.  With 20 bazillionty enemies/bosses/rooms you do get a dud here and there, occaisional things that rather need an overhaul as they can produce unavoidable attacks.  Fortunately, this is quite rare (and expansions make it more rare).  But still, it DOES happen every now and then.  

Also, the items you find are often just lots of fun to use.  So many creative concepts here.  And the concept of wild synergies just adds to the fun, and makes it so that runs can be so wildly different from one another that even 800+ hours in (I have the game on other platforms) I *still* am surprised by it at times.

Character variety also goes a long way here... there's a darned wide cast of dudes to pick from, and drastically moreso if you buy the expansions.  

The controls are superb, though one small issue is that Isaac's hitbox is... strange.  Even to this day I sometimes find myself not *quite* sure just where it is, particularly as his sprite evolves and warps as you get items.  That's a pretty minor issue though.

And the game can be so darned exciting... when it's being challenging.

One major issue that I've always had with Isaac is that, by default, it is simply far, far too easy.  If you're used to other roguelikes, this one in its base state will be child's play to you.  It has ""balance issues"", and that's putting it VERY mildly.  The game is FAR too easy, allowing the player to become an overpowered disaster almost every run once you know how (and it sure aint hard to figure out how).  While some players like that, I've always found it fantastically boring... I'm sorry, but ""enter room and push win button"" over and over again in 70% of runs isnt very interesting and I find that my interest fades very fast... up until recently, while I love the game, I didnt PLAY it all that often due to the fact that the absolute lack of challenge would cause me to lose interest fast.

Fortunately, that changed with Repentance.  That DLC performs an absolute overhaul of the game's balance, and turns it into more of a PROPER roguelike... darned difficult, and drastically less common that you will get overpowered.  It becomes more in line with other games in this genre, and to me that is a very good thing.  Not to mention that DLC also just adds tons of amazing content.  So, if you want any actual challenge... make sure to pick that up, otherwise you really wont find much of any.  The game is seriously mindless without it.

But, even with that, there are still other issues.  Two particular things stand out to me:  The absolutely atrocious unlock system, and the fact that the game NEVER EXPLAINS ANYTHING.  Wanna know what that item there does?  Well TOO BAD because it will not tell you.  Better learn by trial and error and then MEMORIZE the many 100s of items in here.  Or, better yet, get Afterbirth+ (which adds mod support) and just get the item description mod.  Without that... hoboy, better get used to alt-tabbing.

But then there's the unlock system... I hate it.  I *HATE* it.  Look, I grew up in the days of really primitive games... the 2600 and NES for instance.  I do not, and never will, understand modern gaming's obsession with achievements and unlocks.  But honestly, even for those who DO understand, this is likely to still be a massive source of frustration.  SO MANY FREAKING THINGS are locked behind arbitrary and often irritating nonsense, some of which genuinely does require that the RNG be very kind to you.  Other things are just stupidly annoying, like trying to beat X final boss with The Lost (a challenge character who dies if you look at him too hard).  Or doing ANYTHING with Jacob and Esau (from Repentance) who are fun enough, but who DO NOT work well with unlocks, as the game is not formatted for their bizarre dual hitbox.  An absolutely astonishing amount of things require that you unlock them before using them, and that is... irritating.  It is by far my biggest complaint with the game.

Also, there are expansions!  Great stuff really.  Afterbirth is pretty basic... it is MOAR STUFF, lots of fun things.  Afterbirth+ also adds MOAR STUFF, but is truly about modding the game.  You can customize your experience and play it how YOU want to!  People have come up with some incredibly creative and fun things.  One thing to note: you MUST have Afterbirth+ to use Repentance.

And Repentance itself is, to me, the best of all.  It is Antibirth integrated officially into the game, with way more added on top.  And like I said, it rebalances EVERYTHING.  OP broken things are nerfed, but even moreso, about a bazillion items got buffed.  The game is far harder, and there are alternate levels, even more endings, and ALL of the content is just SO FREAKING GOOD.

One thing I do want to mention though:  particularly with Repentance, this game is at its best when you DONT just stick to ""the meta"" (which is frankly something I say about all roguelikes).  EXPERIMENT with the different items.  Despite what some players may say, I genuinely think there are very, very few ACTUALLY bad items in the game.  Like, less than 10.  There are certainly some situational items out there (and deciding when to take something and when NOT to is a big part of the game!) but that sure doesnt make them bad... learn when they work well, and when they dont.  USE EVERYTHING... even if you've used it before and it seemed bad.  Again, this is seriously advice for the entire genre.  But this DLC *really* ups the need to approach it this way, if you want the best experience and the most fun.

And dont be afraid of losing.  Dont let it bother you when it happens.  Again, good advice for the entire genre, not just this.

There is honestly sooo much more I could say about this game, and almost all of it is positive.  But you know, Steam character limit.

One way or another... it is fantastic.  One of the best.  And the DLC just makes it way better.  It does have a couple of odd issues, sure, but those can be fixed in many cases (with the DLCs) and for those that cant be fixed, well... the rest is just so darned good that those problems get a pass.

Just amazing.  Congratulations to Edmund and his team for creating something so incredible.  And then improving on it even further.

...Seriously get the DLCs though. They are great."

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,poop
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"i have to say, this is a DAMN good game. this was the first game that got me into roguelike games and it did an amazing job at introducing me to the genre. the story of the game is that there is a boy named Isaac who lives with his mother alone, one day however, god tells Isaac's mother to kill him as a way to prove her devotion to him. if you couldn't already tell, this game has a big take on religion. I won't go too in depth with the story or anything but what is a simple story turns into something way more sinister as you keep playing. the game has multiple endings which each tell a part of the story and let me tell you, there are a lot of endings, you get a new one each time you complete a run however later on you will need to do more than just finish a run to achieve the last few endings, some endings will require you to get certain items but you won't need to worry about that until much later on.

just like other roguelike games, when you die, you lose everything and have to restart from the beginning however there are items that can be obtained which allow you to die more than once but I've only ever got those on rare occasions. you may not like it at first because of the whole 1 life thing but just keep playing and you'll get better, that's how i went about playing this anyway and it's one of my favourite games of all time now"

It's very well done and definitely a good investment considering it's price and the hours that go into it. I would recommend this game although with the short story gameplay and excessive gore It's not for everyone.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"Extremely fun and addicting game, love how it could require an insane amount of skill and knowledge and how it might challenge you to play to the best of your abilities. Also love the controversial religious themes it touches.

The game contains a heavy amount of RNG which could both keep your runs fresh and interesting or make them frustrating depending on what the game decides to give you, you still have a lot of influence when it comes to this but you can only do so much sometimes. This personally gave me the feeling as if I didn't win, but the game decided to let me win because you're playing with-and relying on random items.

Also, is there anyone who enjoys playing as Jacob and Esau?"

One major issue that I've always had with Isaac is that, by default, it is simply far, far too easy.  If you're used to other roguelikes, this one in its base state will be child's play to you.  It has ""balance issues"", and that's putting it VERY mildly.  The game is FAR too easy, allowing the player to become an overpowered disaster almost every run once you know how (and it sure aint hard to figure out how).  While some players like that, I've always found it fantastically boring... I'm sorry, but ""enter room and push win button"" over and over again in 70% of runs isnt very interesting and I find that my interest fades very fast... up until recently, while I love the game, I didnt PLAY it all that often due to the fact that the absolute lack of challenge would cause me to lose interest fast.

Fortunately, that changed with Repentance.  That DLC performs an absolute overhaul of the game's balance, and turns it into more of a PROPER roguelike... darned difficult, and drastically less common that you will get overpowered.  It becomes more in line with other games in this genre, and to me that is a very good thing.  Not to mention that DLC also just adds tons of amazing content.  So, if you want any actual challenge... make sure to pick that up, otherwise you really wont find much of any.  The game is seriously mindless without it.

But, even with that, there are still other issues.  Two particular things stand out to me:  The absolutely atrocious unlock system, and the fact that the game NEVER EXPLAINS ANYTHING.  Wanna know what that item there does?  Well TOO BAD because it will not tell you.  Better learn by trial and error and then MEMORIZE the many 100s of items in here.  Or, better yet, get Afterbirth+ (which adds mod support) and just get the item description mod.  Without that... hoboy, better get used to alt-tabbing.

But then there's the unlock system... I hate it.  I *HATE* it.  Look, I grew up in the days of really primitive games... the 2600 and NES for instance.  I do not, and never will, understand modern gaming's obsession with achievements and unlocks.  But honestly, even for those who DO understand, this is likely to still be a massive source of frustration.  SO MANY FREAKING THINGS are locked behind arbitrary and often irritating nonsense, some of which genuinely does require that the RNG be very kind to you.  Other things are just stupidly annoying, like trying to beat X final boss with The Lost (a challenge character who dies if you look at him too hard).  Or doing ANYTHING with Jacob and Esau (from Repentance) who are fun enough, but who DO NOT work well with unlocks, as the game is not formatted for their bizarre dual hitbox.  An absolutely astonishing amount of things require that you unlock them before using them, and that is... irritating.  It is by far my biggest complaint with the game.

Also, there are expansions!  Great stuff really.  Afterbirth is pretty basic... it is MOAR STUFF, lots of fun things.  Afterbirth+ also adds MOAR STUFF, but is truly about modding the game.  You can customize your experience and play it how YOU want to!  People have come up with some incredibly creative and fun things.  One thing to note: you MUST have Afterbirth+ to use Repentance.

And Repentance itself is, to me, the best of all.  It is Antibirth integrated officially into the game, with way more added on top.  And like I said, it rebalances EVERYTHING.  OP broken things are nerfed, but even moreso, about a bazillion items got buffed.  The game is far harder, and there are alternate levels, even more endings, and ALL of the content is just SO FREAKING GOOD.

One thing I do want to mention though:  particularly with Repentance, this game is at its best when you DONT just stick to ""the meta"" (which is frankly something I say about all roguelikes).  EXPERIMENT with the different items.  Despite what some players may say, I genuinely think there are very, very few ACTUALLY bad items in the game.  Like, less than 10.  There are certainly some situational items out there (and deciding when to take something and when NOT to is a big part of the game!) but that sure doesnt make them bad... learn when they work well, and when they dont.  USE EVERYTHING... even if you've used it before and it seemed bad.  Again, this is seriously advice for the entire genre.  But this DLC *really* ups the need to approach it this way, if you want the best experience and the most fun.

And dont be afraid of losing.  Dont let it bother you when it happens.  Again, good advice for the entire genre, not just this.

There is honestly sooo much more I could say about this game, and almost all of it is positive.  But you know, Steam character limit.

One way or another... it is fantastic.  One of the best.  And the DLC just makes it way better.  It does have a couple of odd issues, sure, but those can be fixed in many cases (with the DLCs) and for those that cant be fixed, well... the rest is just so darned good that those problems get a pass.

Just amazing.  Congratulations to Edmund and his team for creating something so incredible.  And then improving on it even further.

...Seriously get the DLCs though. They are great."

its fucking bad this trash game

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"i have to say, this is a DAMN good game. this was the first game that got me into roguelike games and it did an amazing job at introducing me to the genre. the story of the game is that there is a boy named Isaac who lives with his mother alone, one day however, god tells Isaac's mother to kill him as a way to prove her devotion to him. if you couldn't already tell, this game has a big take on religion. I won't go too in depth with the story or anything but what is a simple story turns into something way more sinister as you keep playing. the game has multiple endings which each tell a part of the story and let me tell you, there are a lot of endings, you get a new one each time you complete a run however later on you will need to do more than just finish a run to achieve the last few endings, some endings will require you to get certain items but you won't need to worry about that until much later on.

just like other roguelike games, when you die, you lose everything and have to restart from the beginning however there are items that can be obtained which allow you to die more than once but I've only ever got those on rare occasions. you may not like it at first because of the whole 1 life thing but just keep playing and you'll get better, that's how i went about playing this anyway and it's one of my favourite games of all time now"

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,I'm a huge Legend of Zelda fan so I may be biased in enjoying this game. It's very well done and definitely a good investment considering it's price and the hours that go into it. I would recommend this game although with the short story gameplay and excessive gore It's not for everyone.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"Extremely fun and addicting game, love how it could require an insane amount of skill and knowledge and how it might challenge you to play to the best of your abilities. Also love the controversial religious themes it touches.

The game contains a heavy amount of RNG which could both keep your runs fresh and interesting or make them frustrating depending on what the game decides to give you, you still have a lot of influence when it comes to this but you can only do so much sometimes. This personally gave me the feeling as if I didn't win, but the game decided to let me win because you're playing with-and relying on random items.

Also, is there anyone who enjoys playing as Jacob and Esau?"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"edmund mcmillen You little F**ker, You made a s*** of piece with your trash Isaac its f**king Bad this trash game I will become back my money. I hope you will in your next time be a cow on a trash farm you sucker."

Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,Hollow Knight is a video game
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,i took a look in my backyard and this bug just went and slaughtered a giant moth what the hell
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"After playing this game for 105 hours, I realized something... I am the Hollow Knight...
I started playing this so much to the point that going beyond extremely difficult bosses made me empty inside, I have no more desires and no emotions while playing this because it's like I suffered long term hypnosis and didn't realize that I spent every afternoon of my week playing again... and again... and again...
It took me a long time to decide to write a review about this game, but I can't blame myself for that, as I was too busy getting hooked on it to remember to do anything else important in my life.
I spent days forgetting to eat lunch while playing this wonder, and after Hollow Knight became my favorite game, I realized it's a path of no return... but not a path of pain like the one in the game, but a path of emotion and happiness, and that's why you should stop looking at the reviews and buy this work of art right away, because every second looking at them, it's a second longer that you're away from Hollow Knight.
Stop waiting for promotions and buy the game soon, then we'll go together Embrace the Void."
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,Fantastic game!
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"Hollow Knight changed the way I view video games. Just until now, I was a naïve gamer with roots in taking movies really seriously that spilled into my other hobbies, especially gaming. If there was no in-game motivation to continue playing then I would lose the desire to continue. It's the reason why I dropped so many games that would be considered ""prestigious"", where platformers would never be a consideration again after my disappointment with Mario Odyssey and Rayman Origins. Not that these games were bad or not well-made, they could have had the best platforming mechanics for all I know, but without the cinematic qualities of the games I'm used to - I dropped them. 

Then here's me on a whim, hearing about the praise this game is getting and it sitting in my library for an unspecified amount of time. I decided to play a game that was the complete antithesis to what I enjoyed - a 2D platformer Metroidvania without a narrative. I've tried to play this game at least a few times, but I never got past 20 minutes due to me being confused.

But for some reason I just felt the urge to try at least one more time. At least one more to make sure I have an opinion on this game.

Went into it with low expectations.

Turns out I loved it. This game is a top contender for why games can be considered art without trying to replicate other aspects of mediums. It is a game that can only exist as a game that doesn't borrow anything else. Platforming controls are refined to a touch, making movement and combat feel smooth and rewarding. It may be simplistic, but it is with this simplicity it excels. The combat and movement incrementally upgrade, but never complicate the fundamentals of the game.

But the best part of this game is exploration and how rewarding it is to revisit locations that were once unattainable after getting an ability. The game teases these locations frequently, but there is no indication as to where and how you get there, relying on the player's intuition to put two and two together. It does not hold your hand at all - which is why I was once lost when I first began. But that is the point: the game makes you feel lost, but rewards the feeling of being rudderless as you explore new areas without a map at first. 

Each new area is expertly designed to be a challenge to navigate without being an annoyance, but rewards exploration. The game is not easy, but it's rewarding to venture through the caves and build a pathway in your mind as to how to venture through the caves. This game relies on creating an atmosphere that is gloomy and dark, without inducing a sense of dread. It is mysterious with lore sprinkled throughout without much explanation as to what it may be. It is there without calling attention to itself, but rewards those who seek to find more information.

My only major complaint with the game is the fact that enemies do damage to you when they shouldn't, such as when they scurry away from you. But this is a nitpick at most - it does increase the tension of every encounter.

Other than that: Hollow Knight is art. It is art that changed the way I view this medium and only furthered my appreciation for gaming without a story. The most rewarding aspect is the way this game builds upon concepts and rewards intuition of the player. This game is not easy - it may be one of the hardest games I've played, but it is just so much fun to continue finding out with this game has to offer that it doesn't get in the way of enjoyment."
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"REALLY LOVE THIS GAME <3 I came to know about this game because i first played Ori and Blind Forest and thought they were similar in concept, but this game is amazing and unique in its own away, i love the story, the characters, the gameplay and especially the art style! Before i played Hollow Knight i never was a person who would play games that have tons of boss fights (i even tend to avoid them as much as possible) but HK really opened up my eyes to the joy of taking on a boss, even though it would frustrate me to have to walk the long ass distance from the last bench to where i died especially when there were platforming challenges or tough enemies to get to my shade and hopefully not die, i always felt super happy when i finally beat a boss and get whatever reward for defeating the boss. As of this review i am only at 94% completion so i am still gonna finish all the other content that i haven't touched yet like godmaster and grimm troupe, both of which i am looking foward to completing :D Im so gonna get Silk Song when it comes out. ALSO CAN I JUST SAY I LOVE THE WHOLE GAME'S SOUNDTRACK KTHXBYE"
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"yes, yes, yes YES a thousand times yes. 
this right here is not a game but instead a masterpiece, something that the average human brain can not understand this is something that only the mightiest of the mightiest could ever desire.

jokes aside, i think Hollow Knight was one of (if not THE) most incredible experiences i've had with a game. the perfect mix between Metroidvania and Souls-Like. If i were to list every single aspect that i loved in this game i would be writing this for hours, but i have to give imense props to the story and sound design, never been so proud of buying a soundtrack bundle as i was with this game's. this is truly a game that i've fell completely in love, and am willing to come back to it later for the 120%. Thank You, Team Cherry for making this such an amazing ride for me.

GIT GUD !"
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,this game i love
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,game
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"I feel old now. Not enough time to play the games I want to play to the extent I want to play them. I haven't sat down and really enjoyed Hollow Knight in a long time. Haven't revisited it to get the achievements, and I've never been interested in speedrunning of any kind. When I have time to game, it's usually with my friends, or I really hunker down and consume a single player game out of the many yet untouched in my library. I love a good story, and I miss the days when responsibilities were few and I could spend as much time as I could imagine just taking in every moment of every game that I felt like. Despite these things, I imagine one day when my hands don't work as well as they did when I was young, and responsibilities become fewer again, and time is still precious but the days empty, I will play Hollow Knight again. And I'll play it the way I did the first time. Slow, without any goals in mind, heights to reach, or anything of the sort. I'll play it again just to experience it again, because in all my years of playing across every console generation from all 3 brands from NES to the current gen and PC for nearly 30 years, likely approaching the completion of 1000 different video games, Hollow Knight is my indisputable favorite."
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,Not for everyone since it's full of bugs :)
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"Hollow Knight is a deeply moody game that sits on the threshhold of souls-like and metroidvania, taking aspects from both genres into one game. It is also a game that has no desire to hold back punches, and gets remarkably difficult in some of its optional content, demanding a level of mastery from the player in both platforming and combat. If you're looking for an 'easy' game, or a game that guides you in any degree beyond dialogues and looking at a map, then Hollow Knight is not for you.

Hollow Knight places you in the shows of a little bug, running around with a sword in a lost bug-kingdom. Soon, you get caught up in the goings on of that ancient place, as it falls to the grips of the ""Corruption"", a glowing, ghostly alien orange light that seems to infect bugs and turn them into insane, mindless creatures, but also offering them incredible strength. A taller beetle named Hornet becomes your sometimes-guide, sometimes rival through the area, along with other NPCs you'll come across. It's again, very similar to seeing the different NPCs throughout the Dark Souls game, and the comparisons come easy and often. You learn about the story in small cutscenes, snippets of dialogue, and item descriptions - something which likely sounds familiar by now.

The game has you roaming around the world, and swiftly gives you access to fast travel, and equipment to make traversing the world easier. Over time, you'll get access to double jumps, wall climbing, dashes, and more, giving you very swift movement throughout the world - though as always, backtracking will be happening, especially for those looking for high percentage clears. Combat is fast, and enemies generally have 0 i-frames whatsoever, meaning combat can be as greedy as you want it to be - something which will quickly get you kiled against the game's many bosses. Various battle techniques will become apparent, such as using your sword in the air to ""pogo"" off of enemies and spikes to bounce endlessly off their heads, or off of the spikes. This technique becomes mandatory later on for some content, so learn it early and use it constantly. Magic is very powerful, and I found great success using equipment (""Charms"") that boosted my magic power early on, later transitioning into a pure sword (""Nail"") focused build for very rapid, long range melee attacks.

The music and sound effects are wonderful, especially in the Deepnest, a downright spooky and spine-tingling area of the game. While jump scares aren't built into the game, there are several points where the game works to make your skin crawl - but just as many other places where it wants you to admire an ancient kingdom, deep, deep underground, covered in dust but in many ways unharmed by time. Every area ha a color pallette unique to it, and area transitions are readily identifiable - at all times the player is alwys perfectly aware of where they are, and how areas connect to each other, which is critical for a metroidvania. It's also doubly crucial, as seeing where you are on the minimap actually requires you to use a Charm equipment slot, which you can only do at a bench/""Bonfire"". This is a controversial decision, and I'll openly admit I spent the vast majority of the game with it equipped to make my life easier.

There is a very large amount of sequence breaking that can occur throughout the game. It is wildly open even from the very start, and openly welcomes attempts to circumvent its usual progression. For those who play metroidvanias to do things like that, as long as you've got the skill and guts to pull it off, Hollow Knight is willing to accomodate. There is also a vast amount of optional content in the game, both story related, and non-main story, in the form of several DLCs, including boss rushes, and an entire side story about a mysterious carnival. The game also commits my least favorite thing about metroidvanias, which is ""invisible walls with nothing around to point out that you can walk through them"", so be ready to press against walls from time to time, looking for side entries and special hidden areas.

I would recommend Hollow Knight to anyone looking for a thoughtful, and challenging Metroidvania, especially for anyone who is willing to put in the time to do all of the optional and extra content - there is a wealth of things to accomplish and see, and it'd be a shame to leave it half done."

Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"One of the most fun games i've ever played! :)
It's very difficult and when you accomplish something,it always feels rewarding!
Go out there and make me proud,knights of Hollownest! :)"
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game.

I've sunk 30 hours into it already and still only have a 70% completion score.
The problem is, only about 10 of those hours or so were actually spent exploring new areas, fighting new bosses, learning new skills... you know, the fun stuff.

The majority of your playtime in this game is going to be backtracking. And I get it, it's a Metroidvania. But this is too much. Too unclear. Too many dead-ends. You check your map and see there were fifteen paths where an obstacle blocked you, but there's no way you're going to remember what exactly each obstacle was. So when you FINALLY stumble upon a new ability, you have to recheck all your old obstructions, one-by-one. Powerups/other useful items are given way too infrequently. Even after 30 hours of gameplay, the story is still pretty cryptic.

Basically there's too much backtracking. My sense of direction in games may not be the best but come on. The majority of your gameplay shouldn't be wandering through the same areas swatting the same mooks you've had to encounter one hundred million times over and over and over again.

The actual gameplay (when you're actually encountering something new, that is) is amazing and crisp. I absolutely adore the art style and aesthetic. The combat is tight and strategic, frantic, and exciting. So much to love about this game. But God, so much to hate also.

I recommend keeping a detailed map open in MS paint where you can fill in notes along the way to help you remember certain obstacles. Or just use a walkthrough. Because fuuuuccccckkkk all this backtracking."

If you're looking for an 'easy' game, or a game that guides you in any degree beyond dialogues and looking at a map, then Hollow Knight is not for you.

Hollow Knight places you in the shows of a little bug, running around with a sword in a lost bug-kingdom. Soon, you get caught up in the goings on of that ancient place, as it falls to the grips of the ""Corruption"", a glowing, ghostly alien orange light that seems to infect bugs and turn them into insane, mindless creatures, but also offering them incredible strength. A taller beetle named Hornet becomes your sometimes-guide, sometimes rival through the area, along with other NPCs you'll come across. It's again, very similar to seeing the different NPCs throughout the Dark Souls game, and the comparisons come easy and often. You learn about the story in small cutscenes, snippets of dialogue, and item descriptions - something which likely sounds familiar by now.

The game has you roaming around the world, and swiftly gives you access to fast travel, and equipment to make traversing the world easier. Over time, you'll get access to double jumps, wall climbing, dashes, and more, giving you very swift movement throughout the world - though as always, backtracking will be happening, especially for those looking for high percentage clears. Combat is fast, and enemies generally have 0 i-frames whatsoever, meaning combat can be as greedy as you want it to be - something which will quickly get you kiled against the game's many bosses. Various battle techniques will become apparent, such as using your sword in the air to ""pogo"" off of enemies and spikes to bounce endlessly off their heads, or off of the spikes. This technique becomes mandatory later on for some content, so learn it early and use it constantly. Magic is very powerful, and I found great success using equipment (""Charms"") that boosted my magic power early on, later transitioning into a pure sword (""Nail"") focused build for very rapid, long range melee attacks.

The music and sound effects are wonderful, especially in the Deepnest, a downright spooky and spine-tingling area of the game. While jump scares aren't built into the game, there are several points where the game works to make your skin crawl - but just as many other places where it wants you to admire an ancient kingdom, deep, deep underground, covered in dust but in many ways unharmed by time. Every area ha a color pallette unique to it, and area transitions are readily identifiable - at all times the player is alwys perfectly aware of where they are, and how areas connect to each other, which is critical for a metroidvania. It's also doubly crucial, as seeing where you are on the minimap actually requires you to use a Charm equipment slot, which you can only do at a bench/""Bonfire"". This is a controversial decision, and I'll openly admit I spent the vast majority of the game with it equipped to make my life easier.

There is a very large amount of sequence breaking that can occur throughout the game. It is wildly open even from the very start, and openly welcomes attempts to circumvent its usual progression. For those who play metroidvanias to do things like that, as long as you've got the skill and guts to pull it off, Hollow Knight is willing to accomodate. There is also a vast amount of optional content in the game, both story related, and non-main story, in the form of several DLCs, including boss rushes, and an entire side story about a mysterious carnival. The game also commits my least favorite thing about metroidvanias, which is ""invisible walls with nothing around to point out that you can walk through them"", so be ready to press against walls from time to time, looking for side entries and special hidden areas.

I would recommend Hollow Knight to anyone looking for a thoughtful, and challenging Metroidvania, especially for anyone who is willing to put in the time to do all of the optional and extra content - there is a wealth of things to accomplish and see, and it'd be a shame to leave it half done."

It's very difficult and when you accomplish something,it always feels rewarding!
Go out there and make me proud,knights of Hollownest! :)"
Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game.

I've sunk 30 hours into it already and still only have a 70% completion score.
The problem is, only about 10 of those hours or so were actually spent exploring new areas, fighting new bosses, learning new skills... you know, the fun stuff.

The majority of your playtime in this game is going to be backtracking. And I get it, it's a Metroidvania. But this is too much. Too unclear. Too many dead-ends. You check your map and see there were fifteen paths where an obstacle blocked you, but there's no way you're going to remember what exactly each obstacle was. So when you FINALLY stumble upon a new ability, you have to recheck all your old obstructions, one-by-one. Powerups/other useful items are given way too infrequently. Even after 30 hours of gameplay, the story is still pretty cryptic.

Basically there's too much backtracking. My sense of direction in games may not be the best but come on. The majority of your gameplay shouldn't be wandering through the same areas swatting the same mooks you've had to encounter one hundred million times over and over and over again.

The actual gameplay (when you're actually encountering something new, that is) is amazing and crisp. I absolutely adore the art style and aesthetic. The combat is tight and strategic, frantic, and exciting. So much to love about this game. But God, so much to hate also.

I recommend keeping a detailed map open in MS paint where you can fill in notes along the way to help you remember certain obstacles. Or just use a walkthrough. Because fuuuuccccckkkk all this backtracking."

Undertale,RPG,391540,"Undertale, such a young classic. It have the biggest community i've ever seen. To this day, there are some people who create fangames, remixes, alternative universes, animations, and they will create even more. But not that it surprises me, I know why it is that way. It's just awesome. Toby Fox put here iconic characters, tons of secrects, great gameplay, perfect balance between silliness and seriousness, and beautiful story. I personally beaten this game thrice, but every time with this same ending, because in the end of this game, you feel that you helped them, and even they are just a game characters, you can feel the bond with them. Maybe thats a reason why it have that strong community too. This game helped to change gaming industry and in many todays games we can see inspiration or easter eggs from undertale. 

If you want to see why this game become so popular, and check if you agree with my opinion, buy it, I reccomend it, with all of the community, especially XTALE."

Undertale,RPG,391540,"Short review:
Memes, a flower that is a jerkwad arsehole, pixel graphics, and a sitcom-like feel.
It's also easy to get smashed by enemies, especially in certain situations.


Standard review:
I've not really ever played a game quite like this, so I've not really much to compare it to, but if Seinfeld (or similar) were made into an RPG, it would be something like this. It's meant to seem more comedic than dark and serious, and it pulls that off very well, even if there are some elements that are not clearly explained and/or can be figured out easily.

The battle mechanics are quite unique; I've never encountered any other system like it. Being able to spare one's opponent is actually a nice touch, though it never works right off the bat, apparently. There's also the defense system, which for me, is one of those things I'm fond of, but I'd improve upon in a couple ways:

1) Larger box for multiple enemies (since they all attack at once and it really makes it difficult to avoid attacks at times)
2) More chances for healing when being kind/merciful (often times one grabs the green only to get hit for more damage than what was healed and that's just bad-especially at 20 MAX HP)

The different soul/heart types are neat and those I'd not alter in any way, but DAMN, are you SLOW as MOLASSES when you do platforming (blue). Caused me to overestimate many of my jumps. Eh, nitpicky.

Ah, yes, the main character. Very ambiguous, kinda reminds me of another novella main character I love, only much cuter and far more benign on the surface (nothing is said about their past before the trip down into Mt. Ebott)...and the fact that everyone refers to the main character as they/them is a really good idea considering the main character is the 'silent protagonist' type (is there really a protagonist here?).

What name did I give the main character? 'Jess'. Not sure why you actually care, but yeah.

There's a lot more I could say, but it would be considered prattling.

So, play it. It's worth getting. Worth the frustration, worth Flowey's condescending and very inaccurate wisdom."

Undertale,RPG,391540,"Undertale blew up and got popular for a reason, it is a [i] good game [/i].  It's just ten dollars, I promise you won't regret it."
Undertale,RPG,391540,"I think that Undertale falls into a certain category of games where you either play it blindly or you just won't be able to experience the game for what truly is, since this story really relies on shock value and putting the player out of his confort zone, if you go into the game already knowing the plostwists and what perspective the game wants you too take it, will in my opinion, ruin half of the experience, and I say half because I do think this game stands out as an RPG alone.

If you are looking for a funny and entertaining story, with lovable and quirky characters, Undertale is just for you! And although you may be desmotivated by the graphics (I like them, but I can understand why some people would think this was made by a monkey who just saw 2 or 3 videos on how to work with Unity). I can assure you that the game uses his aesthetics into his favor (either for jokes or for some new creative way to aproach the combat, dialogue, etc..)

The game also has great music! Mainly because the creator of the game, Toby Fox works as a composer, you can expect to have some real bangers waiting for you (if you want some backgroud, he was the one who composed ""I Miss You - EarthBound 2012"") and you can expect the game to be filled with those ""Homestuck soundtracks alike"" music, either in battle or just wandering around a town, the music of this game is something that never ceases to impress me.

With that being said, I do not recomend you go into this game with the ideia of playing an hardcore RPG, the combat system is something that I find pretty interesting (being a mix of a bullet hell with an actual RPG) and fun! But I don't think you really get ""hard"" battles unless you really seek for those (something that I can't really say much, since I feel it's a major spoiler for the story itself).

In any case, if you are looking for a fun storytelling game, then consider giving Undertale a go! Because I truly belive that this game as something for everyone to enjoy, being the battles, the story, or just the random jokes, this game truly is a classic when we talk about both RPGs and/or Indie Games.

Grimm,Indie,252150,"If you like dark fairy tales then this is a game for you. Lots of different stories that are well known and some that are not, are twisted by an angry dwarf called grimm. It is an easy game to get into, you just run around and corrupt every happy little character into a twisted version of themselves. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to cause chaos and have fun."
Grimm,Indie,252150,"For me, this game is a guilty pleasure. It's not the best or complex game but its a fine casual game for those who enjoy games where you grow more powerful and warp the world around you.

The concept of returning to classic tales to their gritty roots is a fun concept and it's great seeing the world twist around you. It's like playing De Blob or Katamari Damacy but with lower stakes. It's amusing to see the contrast as Grimm corrupts each story but the novelty wears off after awhile. The few platforming sections aren't that great but the levels do offer plenty of variety.

Overall, I think this game is okay and worth at least playing the demo. It offers plenty of content but it can feel monotonous at times."

Overall, I think this game is okay and worth at least playing the demo. It offers plenty of content but it can feel monotonous at times."

Beat Saber,Indie,620980,"Beat Saber is the only game that makes me dread every update.

I know the devs are just trying to improve the game, but it's insulting that they periodically break the game and all the mods and don't even offer a ""betas"" option on steam so I can avoid updates until all hot fixes are in and mod support is ready.

Is there any way I can just totally disable updates on steam for beat saber? I don't care what fancy new features they want to add. I just want to hit blocks with my mods enabled.

But if you don't just click through quickly and take a minute to think about it, you'll experience a really beautiful and emotional game. 10/10."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,It is hard to write a review through eyes filled with tears
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"Everything about this game is so good. Music, story, characters I love it!"
To the Moon,Indie,206440,This has been my favorite game for nearly a decade now.
To the Moon,Indie,206440,I'm not sad.  I HAVE SOMETHING IN MY EYE.
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"Emotional, puzzle-like story with some pleasing to ear pieces of music. Big thanks to my good friend who recommended to me this adventure to the moon."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"the game left me in goosebumps, thats all i can say about ""To The Moon""."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"To the moon is one of the RPG Maker engine classics, its short but sweet and since its gameplay is very simple and it's a fun story to experience by anyone. if its on sale definitely pick it up if you're interested, it will put a smile on your face once you're done playing."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"As the game description says, this is a story driven game about two doctors going back through a dying man's memories to artificially fulfill his last wish. Yes, it's a pixel art game. Yes, the controls are a bit clunky. But the story is out of this world. I don't want to say anything else to avoid spoilers so you just have to trust me on this one, you need to experience the story yourself. i wholly recommend this game."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,Played and cried like 8 times. Absolutely fantastic game!
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"[h1]Just perfect plot combined with reverse storytelling[/h1]
Fking Shit game cant see no shit on my screen with the fking tears in my fking eyes fk u developers fuk u Kan Gao FUCKFUCKFUCK"
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"No need to worry if you're bad at games, since the focus of this game is the story rather than the gameplay. It's very heartfelt and memorable, and makes me cry pretty much every time I play it, watch someone else play it, or even think about it. (Protip: If the solution to a puzzle doesn't seem immediately obvious, try clicking the diagonal before anything else. In my experience, the diagonal is the most confusing part and getting it out of the way early usually makes the puzzle very easy.)"
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"I wish I knew where to start. But I guess I'll start with the fact that I've played and loved many games of varying genres over the years, but this is the first time I've taken a moment to actually write a review on one. This game was just THAT good and carried so much meaning. I can't stop thinking about it. I know some people complain about ""the lack of game play"" and state that ""the puzzles are too easy, and they get bored without more of a challenge"" ... fine. But personally, I can't relate because when I dive into a visual novel, I expect an immersive story and to FEEL things above everything else, and that's exactly what I got from this game. 

If you love a unique, overwhelmingly beautiful, poetic, joyful, sad, even at times twisted and haunting, but still emotionally rewarding and heartwarming story: don't hesitate.
The dialogue was well written, bringing humor and bits of romance into a tragedy and time of death. I not only fell in love with several quotes and beautiful scenes from this story, but also spent about an hour or so crying at the end of it. Not sure if it was from sadness, or joy, or a combination of both.. but this story made me reflect on life in a deep way and left me wanting more. 
The added dlc episodes were simple but great too and I'm now about to play the follow up ""finding paradise"" and I'm really hopeful that I'll feel even half of what I felt from playing To the Moon.

To make a long story short: if you are a human with empathy and feelings, and just want a relaxing visual novel game that you can play to take a break from your busy life or whatever chaotic combat-heavy games you usually find yourself playing: this is it. Relax, soak it in, embrace it, and feel the emotions. It's kind of therapeutic, really. 
 I recommend this game now, and would 100x again. 
Give it a shot."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,Beautiful enough to make a grown man cry
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"To the Moon is a special game.

The story is heartwarming yet sad. This will be your main reason for playing. I found the dialect to be well written and interesting. There were parts that genuinely made me laugh out loud while playing.
The two main characters were fine enough as a vessel to experience the story through but I didn't find them to be particular likeable. I was mainly playing to experience John and Rivers story.

I found the game play to be fairly repetitive. While I appreciate the mini games when going back through the memories, they lost their charm after the 4th or 5th one. Other than that it's a simple click here and read journey. It worked well enough but if the game was any longer I guess it would be more of an issue. 

I did have slow down issues while playing on a notebook for some reason, but changing to a beta alternative version through steam solved that. I would recommend for the story and music alone."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,An amazing game with a story that is just beautiful.
To the Moon,Indie,206440,My F***ing lord this was a flawless game
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"Another worthy addition to Games Are Art movement.
A game which shows you, you don't need AAA, blockbuster graphics, action, explosiions and everything else to distract you from the story.

A game where story is king and crafting of believable characters shows how you can immerse yourself in the world. Beautiful music and writing that makes you follow everything that happens and invests you in their fate.

Interesting decissions going for the story arc will fill you with all kind of emotions, and the ending opens up a discussion about morality and how little things can impact your whole life.

It's a great buy at 4.99.
I trully enjoyed the game after getting over the RPG Maker graphics, but once I got hooked with the characters and story, it became a real gem."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"""I think they're lighthouses.... stuck on the far end of the sky. 
They can see the other lighthouses out there, and they want to talk to them. 
But they can't.... all they can do is shine their lights from afar. 
So that's what they do. They shine their lights at other lighthouses and at me. 
Because one day, I'm going to befriend one of them.""

To the Moon,Indie,206440,This has been my favorite game for nearly a decade now.
To the Moon,Indie,206440,I'm not sad.  I HAVE SOMETHING IN MY EYE.
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"Emotional, puzzle-like story with some pleasing to ear pieces of music. Big thanks to my good friend who recommended to me this adventure to the moon."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"the game left me in goosebumps, thats all i can say about ""To The Moon""."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"To the moon is one of the RPG Maker engine classics, its short but sweet and since its gameplay is very simple and it's a fun story to experience by anyone. if its on sale definitely pick it up if you're interested, it will put a smile on your face once you're done playing."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"As the game description says, this is a story driven game about two doctors going back through a dying man's memories to artificially fulfill his last wish. Yes, it's a pixel art game. Yes, the controls are a bit clunky. But the story is out of this world. I don't want to say anything else to avoid spoilers so you just have to trust me on this one, you need to experience the story yourself. i wholly recommend this game."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,Played and cried like 8 times. Absolutely fantastic game!
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"[h1]Just perfect plot combined with reverse storytelling[/h1]
Fking Shit game cant see no shit on my screen with the fking tears in my fking eyes fk u developers fuk u Kan Gao FUCKFUCKFUCK"
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"No need to worry if you're bad at games, since the focus of this game is the story rather than the gameplay. It's very heartfelt and memorable, and makes me cry pretty much every time I play it, watch someone else play it, or even think about it. (Protip: If the solution to a puzzle doesn't seem immediately obvious, try clicking the diagonal before anything else. In my experience, the diagonal is the most confusing part and getting it out of the way early usually makes the puzzle very easy.)"
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"I wish I knew where to start. But I guess I'll start with the fact that I've played and loved many games of varying genres over the years, but this is the first time I've taken a moment to actually write a review on one. This game was just THAT good and carried so much meaning. I can't stop thinking about it. I know some people complain about ""the lack of game play"" and state that ""the puzzles are too easy, and they get bored without more of a challenge"" ... fine. But personally, I can't relate because when I dive into a visual novel, I expect an immersive story and to FEEL things above everything else, and that's exactly what I got from this game. 

If you love a unique, overwhelmingly beautiful, poetic, joyful, sad, even at times twisted and haunting, but still emotionally rewarding and heartwarming story: don't hesitate.
The dialogue was well written, bringing humor and bits of romance into a tragedy and time of death. I not only fell in love with several quotes and beautiful scenes from this story, but also spent about an hour or so crying at the end of it. Not sure if it was from sadness, or joy, or a combination of both.. but this story made me reflect on life in a deep way and left me wanting more. 
The added dlc episodes were simple but great too and I'm now about to play the follow up ""finding paradise"" and I'm really hopeful that I'll feel even half of what I felt from playing To the Moon.

To make a long story short: if you are a human with empathy and feelings, and just want a relaxing visual novel game that you can play to take a break from your busy life or whatever chaotic combat-heavy games you usually find yourself playing: this is it. Relax, soak it in, embrace it, and feel the emotions. It's kind of therapeutic, really. 
 I recommend this game now, and would 100x again. 
Give it a shot."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,Beautiful enough to make a grown man cry
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"To the Moon is a special game.

The story is heartwarming yet sad. This will be your main reason for playing. I found the dialect to be well written and interesting. There were parts that genuinely made me laugh out loud while playing.
The two main characters were fine enough as a vessel to experience the story through but I didn't find them to be particular likeable. I was mainly playing to experience John and Rivers story.

I found the game play to be fairly repetitive. While I appreciate the mini games when going back through the memories, they lost their charm after the 4th or 5th one. Other than that it's a simple click here and read journey. It worked well enough but if the game was any longer I guess it would be more of an issue. 

I did have slow down issues while playing on a notebook for some reason, but changing to a beta alternative version through steam solved that. I would recommend for the story and music alone."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,An amazing game with a story that is just beautiful.
To the Moon,Indie,206440,My F***ing lord this was a flawless game
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"Another worthy addition to Games Are Art movement.
A game which shows you, you don't need AAA, blockbuster graphics, action, explosiions and everything else to distract you from the story.

A game where story is king and crafting of believable characters shows how you can immerse yourself in the world. Beautiful music and writing that makes you follow everything that happens and invests you in their fate.

Interesting decissions going for the story arc will fill you with all kind of emotions, and the ending opens up a discussion about morality and how little things can impact your whole life.

It's a great buy at 4.99.
I trully enjoyed the game after getting over the RPG Maker graphics, but once I got hooked with the characters and story, it became a real gem."
To the Moon,Indie,206440,"""I think they're lighthouses.... stuck on the far end of the sky. 
They can see the other lighthouses out there, and they want to talk to them. 
But they can't.... all they can do is shine their lights from afar. 
So that's what they do. They shine their lights at other lighthouses and at me. 
Because one day, I'm going to befriend one of them.""

Baba Is You,Indie,736260,Really great puzzle game. You gotta think out of the box for this one.

Baba Is You,Indie,736260,"This rabbit hole goes really deep. Deeper than you think. The things this game does with its rules gets pretty darn crazy.

Most of the rules are self-explanatory, but some are not obvious in how they interact with you and other objects, which can make some puzzles frustrating and lead to ""What! That's how that works?!""

In general though, they're all very enjoyable and some make good use of misdirection. Getting past that one puzzle you were stuck on for days and being able to say that you figured it all out on your own is something that makes you feel vry smrt.

If you're prone to looking things up you might not get as much enjoyment out of this aspect of the game.

Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"after beating the game, the replay value is less. An expansion of sorts or new skulls would be helpful"
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"Good game
lotsa gameplay
hard enough to be fun but not annoying
every boss you beat feel rewarding
help im addicted"
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"After I finished the all game I can say my really opinion about the game.
This game is from a Roguelike genre and if you like this genre you will liked this game.
Anyone can like this game even if they have not played in this genre.
The game takes you straight to the plot and there are not so many things here that are hard to understand.
I liked how each character did in this game, they look crazy. You can improve them all to legendary characters and then they look better and stronger.
Also the items look good and The items also look good and have ranks like common, rare, unique and legendary. Like for characters.
The boss fights, Well I have no words because they look crazy and very difficult but fun.
In my opinion, this is the best game I have played so far.
GOOD GAME."
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,basiccly hades but you die more and also bonk
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"Good-ish game, but the enemies attacks leave me feeling like I've been cheated. I especially hate how the developer's version of difficulty is often able to boiled down to throw more enemies at you and make it so there's less you can actually do to the enemies around you. For example take the mini boss fights in the middle of each level. Each level you progress they just throw more minibosses at you until you are overwhelmed, or you get lucky enough to have a ridiculous build that can carry you to the final boss. The game becomes a battle of attrition until you die, or beat the final boss. The game leaves something to be desired, it's a novel idea and all, just lacks adequate execution. From a game where I would expect to be defeating heroes I would imagine I would be fighting small parties, but instead I have to fight hordes of worthless soldiers that sometimes get free hits on me. I would also expect to be incredibly tanky, but end up being able to die faster than I can in dead cells. On the other side of things, the art direction and style of the game are impeccable, and are something that keeps me from hating this game. The music often calms me down after a stressful run, and the tracks throughout are honestly good. Despite being mostly foreign (from what I know) the devs are hardworking and seem to be caring for their community, even if they are masochists like me for playing games like this. In conclusion the gameplay doesn't really feel all that skill based, but the game still looks and feels good for the most part (I'm looking at you, concentration mechanics)."
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"ROCK AND STONE, BROTHERS!
(You can pet the skul!)"
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"fucking good
"
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"Skul: The Hero Slayer is a creative take on rougelikes, you play as a skeleton that slays heroes as the title makes obvious. Instead of having selectable characters you find skulls throughout your run. You can hold two of the at a time and you can switch between them they give you different abilities and attacks. Would highly recommend to rougelike fans or anyone looking for a good challenge."
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"Way more addictive than I'd like to admit, can't wait for it to get more updates"
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"This game reminds me of dead cells a lot, because of the constant starting back from beginning, though there are power ups and upgrades you can get, this game is difficult but very fun and rewarding would recommend to anyone who enjoys a challenge while having fun :]"
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"This one is a really well done sidescrolling rouglite.
The main selling point here is the skull switching mechanic: you collect different skulls to transform into one of the numerous ""classes"", each with their unique abilities and mechanics.

There are some balancing issues between the skulls, but I think it's inevitable in this type of game. Some skulls are just bad and have no redeeming abilities, while others are so strong you don't really need to do anything except holding down the attack button (if you collected certain items, at least).

Other than that, it's a fun time killer. I thought it was repetitive at first and and it seemingly gets very difficult in the later areas, so I didn't really think I would finish this game. But I ended up finishing it just playing for a couple of hours when I have free time.

It can, indeed, get a bit repetetive, but only if you try to binge the game, replaying runs over and over again many times in a row.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this one if you like sidescrolling action-rpgs and rouglites."
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,打击感十足到位，元素众多搭配灵活，同时关卡设计紧凑。但是有些boss是真的很难，妥妥的硬核游戏。
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"Not a fan of the level design. The visuals seemed to lack a bit of clarity in terms of hit boxes. The jump high was just slightly less than you though it would be, and it made so many more level a good bit more annoying."
Skul: The Hero Slayer,Indie,1147560,"Its a fun rogue lite but its kinda repetitive and has issues with balance and gameplay clarity. The difficulty curve is also too steep imo like from the third world/area bosses require a lot of dodging with pin point precision which might not even be possible due the skull (class) you're currently using. This is made worse with the RNG. Skul is a roguelite that is a roguelite where you're strengths and abilities are largely dependent on the skulls you pickup in the game (hence the name). These act as classes and there are a lot of them. Some are seriously powerful and fun like the Grim reaper, Rock star (yes you can be a rock star), lich, berserker etc. but a lot of the others are kinda meh. If you don't get the good ones your run is kinda fucked. You might have to grind a lot improve your base stats/abilities through the meta progression to mitigate the RNG. THe clarity issues can also be pretty annoying and makes the dodging even harder. As others have mentioned in the reviews, mid to late game the screen can get pretty chaotic with tons of enemies, projectiles and attacks. Its hard to git gud, when you're experiencing sensory overload and potentially a seizure even.

The artstyle, sound and the game design itself are actually pretty well done. I feel the game's balance is its weak point. I got in thinking it'd be more like dead cells but it's not quite as engaging. I kinda still like the game and have a soft spot in my heart because it clearly has a lot of effort put into it... but honestly I can't quite recommend it at the moment  unless you're a masochist who wants to git gud."

Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,accurate portrayal of real life Miami
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"When you play until 3:30 in the morning to get an A+ score on a level, then you know the game has you by the balls :)

This game is set in the 80s in Miami, and that is for me already a reason not to miss out on this one. Hotline Miami is a top-down pixelated game, containing a lot of gore and violence. The game is mysterious and has trippy flashing colors, neon lights, VHS rental stores, blinking lights, shaking cameras and text. There is a large selection of (melee) weapons which you can use to kill/slaughter your enemies. While swinging your golf stick, bat, knife, dart or katana, you make your ways through 20 levels. I loved it where half dead people were crawling over the floor, super funny! (I am not sure how this sounds to the reader.)
 
Make sure you empty your uzi, shotguns and machineguns on hundreds of enemies, who always react faster than light and with an accuracy of a sniper. Take note that every touch/bullet of an enemy means instant death. I was a bit wondered that one of the first achievements I got was 'Die 1000 times', since in most game I try not to die at all or as less as possible. In this game dying is part of the game. The game is extremely fast paced and will bolster your reactions. The pumped up music fits very well to this game and is a joy to listen to.

To master the game and to get all achievements will take serious effort. To get A+ grades on all levels is mostly very doable except for the level 'Hot and Heavy'. To get A+ there, I wanted a 20x combo so bad that at a certain moment I think I started to look like the characters in this game. I am proud to have the ""achievement whore"" in this game :D. Your second-last achievement will be: Get A Life. Now as an achievement whore I have my life back and can sleep before 3:30 at night again, thank you for that!    

If you like games that brutally punish you for the slightest mistake, play this game. The way points explode after every kill, or the fact that the music never stops when you die, leaves you no other option than to continue the game until you end up as an achievement whore like me."

Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"The first word that describes what is Hotline Miami either when completing the game or while playing is: Addictive.
With simple and fluid gameplay and high replay factor, Hotline is one of those short-stage games that makes you lose track of time and not want to stop playing. The challenge and reward in each new success make you repeat to yourself over and over again ""okay, just one more mission and I'll stop"" and you never stop.
The story manages to be simple and mysterious at the same time, you get calls and your mission is to kill people, just like that, without knowing why, who these people are, and what these animal masks mean, it's totally thought-provoking and grabs your attention from beginning to end.
The game mechanics are great, the controls are very responsive and the gameplay is on the verge of excellence, whenever you fail in a mission you identify where your mistake was and adapt to not commit it again. The pixel art is great, the vaporwave aesthetic fits perfectly with the time the game is set and the soundtrack is absurdly good... Very, very, very good, really... Listen to this even when you're not playing.
I really can't see any reason not to play Hotline Miami, this is a ""must play""."

If you like games that brutally punish you for the slightest mistake, play this game. The way points explode after every kill, or the fact that the music never stops when you die, leaves you no other option than to continue the game until you end up as an achievement whore like me."

Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"Some idiots say that ""video games cause violence.""
this ain't true.
games like these are places where you can empty your anger and hate. unwanted feelings.
just like boxing and any kind of sport and martial art.
Video games don't make people be violent in real life,
it's the real life that makes me want to kill people in video games.
Be Smart; Play whatever the f*** u want; and of course... Play Hotline Miami 1&2."

Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"The first word that describes what is Hotline Miami either when completing the game or while playing is: Addictive.
With simple and fluid gameplay and high replay factor, Hotline is one of those short-stage games that makes you lose track of time and not want to stop playing. The challenge and reward in each new success make you repeat to yourself over and over again ""okay, just one more mission and I'll stop"" and you never stop.
The story manages to be simple and mysterious at the same time, you get calls and your mission is to kill people, just like that, without knowing why, who these people are, and what these animal masks mean, it's totally thought-provoking and grabs your attention from beginning to end.
The game mechanics are great, the controls are very responsive and the gameplay is on the verge of excellence, whenever you fail in a mission you identify where your mistake was and adapt to not commit it again. The pixel art is great, the vaporwave aesthetic fits perfectly with the time the game is set and the soundtrack is absurdly good... Very, very, very good, really... Listen to this even when you're not playing.
I really can't see any reason not to play Hotline Miami, this is a ""must play""."
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,a masterpiece. made me fall in love with the sound of synthwave. awesome visuals and sick gameplay. worth 100%ing
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,fuck you best fucking game of all time buy it right fucking now pussy you fucking wont and i will come to your house and give you cbt until you buy this fucking game right thr goddamn motherfuckin hell now bitch holy shit i love this game it is 1134 rn and im hihg off my ass and the ambulence is on its way
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,good good good
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,man this shit its a masterpiece
Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"Just play it.
Become violence personified. Try to make sense of this brutal gameplay, and finally understand that it is all about your guts and the ""R"" key. You will press this key thousands of time.
This game will punish you. You will like it."

Hotline Miami,Indie,219150,"One of my favorite games. 
After completing the game, I can highly recommend it. Game is quite difficult, you need patience to complete it,  if you have no patience, don't buy this game and play candy crush instead. The game takes place in Miami in the late 80's. game is about a man who will kill everyone he sees. Plus music. Don't turn off the music in this game or you'll need help. After completing the game, you should play Hotline Miami 2"

        [td]Gameplay Loop[/td]
        [td]10[/td]
	[td]Okay, I was not expecting to like this game as much as I did. At all. I'd heard praise but I still had pretty contained expectations. But the gameplay loop is almost faultless. And it's because of this player-driven layered approach to the design. On layer 1 you could breeze through the levels pretty easily for the most part, to just get to the end. But of course, who's gonna do that right? There's strawberries scattered throughout the levels and while they're optional - they will act as the core challenge for most players. But it doesn't stop there. Then you have special casette levels which are music-centric, and unlock B-sides to every level which are WTFFF? And did I mention C-sides??? Like some sick monster who wanted to make each and every player feel sexually inept on their own level designed this game - but it's still so perfect. The game doesn't kick you down for failing, but makes you embrace failure as only a stepping stone towards inevitable success. And that philosophy is baked in every aspect - and executed so very well. If you're even vaguely interested in this - please give Celeste a try.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Narrative[/td]
        [td]8[/td]
	[td]Where I found myself surprised the most was the narrative, actually. It started off looking like some generic everyday story that most indie games would use to move the game ahead, but it actually has some really nice introspective tranquil moments. While I was initially put off by the black and white ""okay so this is your devil form with all your bad qualities ha ha ha"" aspect - I got around to it during the course of the game. I do think the dialogue was a little too cheesy and I think I would've rated it higher with even less dialogue and more food for thought. Why I give this an 8 though is not because of the writing, but because of how the game translated the metaphors of ""running from your demons"" or ""fighting them head on"" or ""finally embracing yourself for who you are"" and ""grasping for that last straw of hope"" into gameplay. It takes these abstract themes of self doubt, rage, anxiety, persistence and somehow creates them into a platforming level each time. A really good marriage of story and gameplay.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Visuals[/td]
        [td]7[/td]
	[td]I really like how the game looks. The art style complements the themes very well, and the characters are well-drawn and distinct. Important things in the world stand out visually, and the hair color being used for gameplay reasons is really good as well. One of the best-looking pixel-art games IMO. I do think they could've added a little more distinct visual cues for stamina running out, maybe make it optional?[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Mechanics[/td]
        [td]9[/td]
	[td]I might update this to a 10 eventually, or when I inevitably return to the game. The mechanics are pretty much perfect. The movement is tight, there is no useless slip to the character, the different elements it introduces are well done. But while there's almost no objective fault with the mechanics as such, there are 2 things I want to note though. One - Caroline's head doesn't have a hitbox, which ends up me going through things that should have killed me, but don't. And getting used to that makes me think I can use that but since there is no visual distinction anymore, it's easy to hit that arbitrary hitbox inside Caroline's neck or wherever in the body. Another is a bit more personal, but unlike a lot of other top-tier games I've played where I don't even feel like I'm holding the controller anymore - I very much had this realization almost throughout Celeste. Like I knew I was controlling a video game interface. Maybe it was because of the weird reverse jump thing I don't want to do but the character does anyway when I press jump while hanging on a surface? This is the reason I think I could possibly bump it to 10, as it could very well be me not being used to this mechanic and a couple little things like that - because the airborne platforming felt smooth af the whole time.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Challenge[/td]
        [td]10[/td]
	[td]As I said in the first section, the challenges are well layered. So anyone can choose how hard they want the game to be depending on their level of experience and skill with video games. This IMO is one of the game's biggest strengths, because it respects player agency while also adding replay value - since I don't think anyone playing blind like me could possibly catch each and every thing the game has to offer. It might be one of the hardest games I've ever played, and I still never found myself raging somehow. That's how much the game eases you into the systems. It gives you challenges that make you say ""that's impossible lmao"" and then shows you how you were capable of it all along. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Variety[/td]
        [td]9[/td]
	[td]The game has just 2 core mechanics - climbing on walls using a stamina meter and an air dash. And it builds these 2 mechanics throughout the course of the campaign, and keeps introducing new mechanics and tools one after another. And all of them are very top tier quality, except maybe the hotel level, where the element only seemed to be ""touch thing and you die"". But apart from that, every new level changed the way you traverse the map, change the way you reach to strawberries and change the way the air dash is contextualized. And for once, a game puts its best content in the last chapter. Brilliant variety.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Mapping[/td]
        [td]9[/td]
	[td]The level design in this game is god tier. The levels harmonize perfectly with the new element that has been introduced, and a lot of them leave enough room to take 'shortcuts' to be faster or do things slightly your way. I enjoyed finding the subtle hints of the secrets that were hidden throughout the game - but some that I found by pure accident felt like they could only be found this way - pure accident. It was the illusory wall kind of thing like with Dark Souls - but sometimes with no hints on which wall to bang IMO. And I don't mean every secret should be a shining through a crack on the wall, but say there was one where you're riding the red ball  to the left and i mistakenly pressed up and dash by mistake, and it turns out there's a secret room there. And that part was visually indistinguishable from the rest of the map. I might think differently on a revisit when I pay more attention, but that's what I think rn.   [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Sound[/td]
        [td]9[/td]
	[td]It's kind of annoying how this game is pretty much faultless across all categories ngl. Everything from the mechanics, to the challenge, to music to the themes are all so well done and go with the singular core idea. The music has a very retro feel with the composition being distinct enough that I could hear it anywhere and say ""ah ok celeste music"" and that's more than most games can say[/td]

Celeste,Indie,504230,"""its a mastahpiece for yo wallet"" - videogamedunkey

Celeste has nailed the difficulty aspect of game design like no other platformer. Each chapter is composed of a series of screens. When you die you go back to the beginning of the screen. That's it, no lives, no gameovers, nothing. Just brush it off and try again. But with each try you'll learn something new, or get lucky and get just a little bit further than last time. So you get more enticed than frustrated. You want to see how far you can get this time, you can feel yourself learning the screen through each try, breezing through difficult sections that seemed impossible five minutes ago.

And so the game leads you on. The main story, collecting strawberries, the hearts, the Core, the B-sides, the C-sides and the epilogue chapter, Farewell. There's so much game to be played, and it just gets crazier and crazier, and harder and harder with an endless set of mechanics and creative twists on them. But it never feels completely out of reach, as you get familiarized and grow as a player.

I feel Celeste only falters difficulty-wise on the C-sides and part of Farewell. There are some screens in them that are not exactly difficult, just long. So they'll take your while not because they present an impossible challenge, but a series of moderate challenges you have to take without missing. Then it can get pretty frustrating learning a part when it takes 3-15 minutes between each time you are able to get there. The relief of finally getting them was still pretty sweet though.

Celeste is also much more than a difficult, but rewarding game. One could praise it's story, plot, characters, soundtrack, and a lot more. But the challenge was what kept me coming back for 76 hours of playtime before getting all achievements, all for less than a box of chicken nuggets. Regardless of the currency you're buying it from or if it's on sale or not, this is the best cost-benefit deal in Steam"

Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,This game is ridiculously good. I didn't even know you could DO what they did with the second boss. It only gets harder.
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"Simple to pick up, but very engaging.
Charming story and characters.
Pulls some shenanigans that kind of blew my mind.

Extremely good."
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"Simply put, Rhythm Doctor is an amazing game. Here’s why:

Rhythm Doctor is a rhythm game that seems very simple at first look, but is the complete opposite. This game absolutely astonished me, with every level having a different story and mechanic to it. The boss levels and night levels were amazing to me, and the characters and story have so much charm to them. The story mode levels were spectacular, and the distractions were so much fun to work through. The hard mode specifically, brings a really good challenge to the game, and makes it extremely satisfying when you S+ a song. The music is amazing, the gameplay is amazing, making this game one of my favourite rhythm games ever. There’s tons of creativity put into the base game, and lots more creativity in the community levels which you can make yourself, using the level editor. Either way, I 100% recommend buying this game."

Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"Don't judge a game by it's cover. 

It's the fun rhythm game so far I ever play :D

"
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"The current main content of this game sums to about 2 hours if you don't fail any of the stages (assuming that's possible, I didn't need to retry any), but don't let that convince you that it's not worth the price of admission already.

I've played a number of rhythm games through the years that don't manage to satisfyingly match up visuals with both the music and with the gameplay audio cues, but Rhythm Doctor absolutely nails that right out of the gate. The game's visual clues are clear and accurate, and explained with appropriately placed tutorials that are just as long as they need to be, and merge seamlessly with the narrative. Many different visuals will be thrown at you in an attempt to break your rhythm, but if your sense of rhythm is strong enough you'll be able to power through with the strength of the audio alone. At no point during the current main story content did I feel I missed a beat because I wasn't given enough information about where it should be.

On top of the stellar gameplay, there is a lovely cast of characters who move in and out of the admittedly short story, and they're mostly well realised, with most of the songs adding meaningfully to the stories and personal journeys throughout.

The combination of rock-solid gameplay, excellent music and touching narrative did actually move me to tears a couple of times! I'm going to have a lot of fun working through the more challenging alternative levels and I'm eagerly anticipating future updates.

If you're a fan of rhythm games this is an absolute no-brainer."

Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"Awesome! The best music/rhythm game I've ever played! The animations, the music, are incredible! Beautiful story and genre. Anyone can play this just because of how easy it is to control and how calming it is. Can't wait for the developers to release more acts!"
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,"Everything about this game is phenomenal! The music is spot on, the graphics are quirky cute and pleasing to the eyes. I have had a blast working my way through the levels, while none of them seemed too challenging to me (I am a drummer), the final boss did throw me for a loop and I had to try several times to get it. Overall, I have replayed it several times trying to best my scores. I can't wait to see what else they add to the game. Highly Recommended!"
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,This rhythm game is unlike any other game I have played. The amount of creativity with little cute stories is so well done. Literally the 2nd boss and how they decided to 'play' with you visually is enough for me to be blown away!
Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,This game is hella dope. Big reccomend my only issue is that I wish there was a streamer mode. When I streamed the game sometimes the viewers were unable to see what was happening because I can only show one screen at a time.

Rhythm Doctor,Indie,774181,good but hard game
GRIS,Indie,683320,"This is a just-barely recommend from me. It's absolutely a piece of art, and while it didn't move me too much (I'm broken and old), I can see the themes are there and would definitely click with the right player. And of course the art and music are great.

The problem is the gameplay. It's not agonizing or terrible like a lot of games I've played, but it is annoying and commits a *lot* of cardinal game design sins. The biggest and most obvious is that the biggest challenge in the entire game is figuring out what's an obstacle/platform and what isn't. I had to google for puzzle help twice, and both times the answer was that I couldn't see a platform that was not even intended to be hidden. There's a whole section of the game (underwater) where the walls and places that aren't walls look literally identical (pure black). There's a screenshot showing this in the list (second to last one) - the only reason I know that pillar isn't solid is because there's open space behind it. You just have to infer from what's around whether it's an obstacle or not. That was my biggest gripe by far, but there are a lot of other smaller game design problems. 

Fundamentally though, you're here for the art and message, and the gameplay doesn't get very much in the way of that. It is never super taxing, and there isn't any way to fail, and the whole thing is quite short. I think it's pretty much where it should be on that spectrum. I would not have played it if it were longer, but I don't regret playing it as is."

The game forces the player to traverse pain and reach the light (overcome grief) at the end. The colors in this game represent a narrative device which will slowly be revealing the plot as the player progresses through the game.  A masterpiece of a game and highly recommended. 
9.5/10"

GRIS,Indie,683320,"beautiful visuals, beautiful score. My only complaint is that it didn't go on forever."
GRIS,Indie,683320,GIRL!
GRIS,Indie,683320,Some games are beautiful and artsy with great gameplay. This game is artsy with no gameplay. There's nothing interesting or fun about the game part of this game.
GRIS,Indie,683320,"This game is wonderful, I got the Journey vibe from this and I loved every second of it. The music alone evokes intense emotion in me from somewhere deep. It really is a beautiful experience..."
GRIS,Indie,683320,"The music in this game is amazing, as well as the art style. In fact, I wouldn't have brought the game without listening to the soundtrack.

However, the gameplay experience is, I would say, boring. The puzzle is not that hard but you lose your sense of direction easily and don't know what to do especially in the second half of the game. There's not much plot to it and I lost my patience to explore and just wanted to finish the game.

Edit: I've just watched an analysis of Gris on YouTube. It looks like I've miss the point. Might replay it in the future."
GRIS,Indie,683320,"Game starts a bit slow, but it picks up amazingly well. The art and sound direction is masterclass and this game is not to be missed.
If you like games like Monument Valley, then pick this up without thinking twice
"
GRIS,Indie,683320,"This game is slow paced. it is good for people like me. Its puzzles is very easy too. Youd odnt really need to think about different path in this game or hidden route or something like in mario or sonic. you just walk and its the right route. The ending is good too. Again, this game is kinda slow paced and im absolutely okay with that."
GRIS,Indie,683320,"Obviously the visuals and audio for this game are stunning but what i found was that, unlike what some other reviews said, this game is pretty intuitive, the mechanics just make sense and it's all very logical, u might get stuck if u don't notice something but if you look around for a bit longer you'll find your way around"
GRIS,Indie,683320,"This is a really unique experience; it does not feel like other games. You control someone grappling with emotional trauma, journeying through various environments that all exhibit the same minimalist aesthetic. The soundtrack is just as impressive as the visual art, usually contributing to the tranquility but also creating tension when it is needed. Although this is a video game, it would be a good short film as well. In spite of all this praise, I would not buy this game at full price: it took me a bit over 3 hours to finish the game and less than 7 hours overall to get every achievement. I would recommend playing through the game before looking up a Steam Guide for how to 100% it, as you can backtrack to each chapter's checkpoints once you are done to find everything you missed. Even then, try not to rush, since finding all the glowing circle things will give you access to a secret scene that fully explains the story and backtracking gets annoying. 

Not on sale? Maybe buy it, depending on how much you value like $10. On sale? Definitely buy it!"
GRIS,Indie,683320,"The graphics and music are 10/10. The puzzles overall are fun but sometimes its hard to tell whats a platform and whats part of the background, making some puzzles tedious and confusing. There were three times in which I was just walking around in circled just because I didnt see a small butterfly in a jar.

Besides that, the game is really enjoyable, the platforming is fun and it portrays a beautiful story that some may relate to.

OMORI,Indie,1150690,"game hits too close to home
except the part where he has friends"
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"OMORI is a psychological horror roleplaying game which should be experienced with little to no prior knowledge of its story. It tackles dark topics which include depression, anxiety, and suicide, as per warnings. As such, this review will be avoiding anything that would be deemed too much of a spoiler past the first hour of the game, but I would highly recommend playing the game yourself first.

What OMORI does extremely well with its storytelling is the gradual buildup from the foundation up. You know that the game is a psychological horror with topics like depression, anxiety, and suicide, but you have no idea how and when they fit into the story. While everything may seem cheerful and upbeat in the beginning, you will slowly be shown pieces of the other side, which recurs throughout the game. This leaves a lot of mystery in the beginning, allowing room for speculation on what is happening around you. However, a clearer picture does form quite literally the further you get into the game, and leads to a great climactic ending that pays off all the buildup.

As a story that heavily revolves around the characters present in the game, OMORI does an amazing job at having a cast of characters that you can really care about and can also relate to. They all have their own unique personality albeit exaggerated, which fits in with the grand scheme of things. You will be able to see the character dynamic they have with one another, and how they change throughout the story given the situation. One big thing OMORI hits home on is if you can relate to the main character; through its portrayal of depression, anxiety, and suicide, the game does a great job revolving around how those topics can have a lasting impact. That is not to say that you must have experienced those emotions before to love OMORI, but it can be extremely relatable to those who have.

The story and characters in OMORI are brought together by the visual and auditory charm the game exerts. All the soundtracks are bangers and fit their respective occurrences, ranging from relaxing exploration music to intense boss battle themes that go hard. They are definitely memorable, especially the ones at key moments throughout the game that will leave you thinking about them in the future. As for the artstyle, the pencil drawing the game uses has a unique charm to it that really fits with the story and characters in OMORI. It was always great to see it during combat and cutscenes.

OMORI’s combat is in the form of a turn-based RPG, which was a genre I was not the biggest fan of. That being said, I found the combat to be pretty enjoyable regardless as it had a decent amount of variety in what you could do with it. There are emotion states for your characters and enemies, which added a layer of strategy to plan for and play around. This is on top of the various skills and equipment you would unlock throughout the game, rewarding you for exploring the world. One thing that really kept my attention with the combat was the pencil artstyle; the characters and their varying expressions were always a joy to see, especially when they were at different emotional levels. The attacks you have were also great in that sense, like the headbutt’s animation.

If there was one thing to criticize about the game OMORI, it is the pacing issue it has. Oftentimes I found areas to be drawn out a bit too long, especially when trying to interact with everything in the game. It can feel nonsensical at times when it is not directly related to the main story, but I was personally fine with it as you were introduced to more side characters and soundtracks. This will become an issue though if you decide to run the game again for alternate endings and/or going for a full completion, as the combat starts getting old alongside the pacing issues.

I really enjoyed playing through OMORI, and it is a game I will be remembering for a long time. It has had quite the impact on me through the story it tells and also the message it ultimately delivers, and I have been thinking about it the past few days. This was a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the game, and it was a blast to experience the highs and lows with the main cast of characters. I would definitely recommend this game in a heartbeat."
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"my day be so fine

then boom,"
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"Fantastic game, It broke me down and then lifted me back up. It'll play with your emotions and make you feel VERY uncomfortable at times. But there are times it'll make you feel very warm.

It's a masterpiece.

OMORI,Indie,1150690,What a tall building..
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"A highly anticipated JRPG for multiple years in the making with lots of love and detail that is visible to see in the experience and joy you would have from playing this game. This is not Undertale with pacifist endings and whatnot but a story of a boy and his friends. 

I personally recommend this game."
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"a wonderful game, i've waited 6 years and nearly turned 18 by the time it released.
i've had a blast playing it, i spent months delaying finishing it because i didn't want to rush, but the ending was more emotional than i could have ever expected. i suggest playing it blind, on my first run i got the true ending with the secret cutscene at the end. once you've done a full run i totally recommend going to the other endings and route.

omori's endings are def well done, as they're able to make you feel the full weight of what you've done and how your choices led you to what ending you got. i also love how it also gives you enough room to think about your own ending when it comes to the true ending.

but one thing is clear, omori is a game about trauma,guilt,friendships,love and forgiveness.
omori is most certainly a game about how forgiveness isn't always easy. that forgiveness towards yourself is probably the most difficult and perhaps the hardest thing to do,how no matter if someone else forgives you or not all you can do is ask for it and accept what happens in hope of finding peace.

a game about how mistakes can turn a person's life around,how mistakes can burden you and warp your mind. a game about how sometimes, you have to face the truth if you want to find peace.
and most certainly, a game about how doing something bad does not make you a bad person and that no one can punish you more than you already punish yourself.


spoilers from this point onwards, be warned.

the true ending is a painful reminder that, even the best ending isn't the happiest in some stories. the way it cuts off right as you're about to cut off,and lets you think- would you forgive sunny and basil? would you forgive yourself? and after all the time you've spent with everyone, how would they react? the way guilt,fears,and trauma are tied in together so well, the plot twist wasn't what at all i might have expected,basil's role was also a surprise to me.

the fact also that you cannot avoid uncomfortable tasks like stabbing yourself,or can't run away from battles that make you uncomfortable are all ways to really allow us to connect with sunny/omori and relate to him, we've all been in uncomfortable positions that we couldn't escape from and had to face head on.

as someone with ptsd and trauma, a lot of what sunny experienced hit home which is also what made my experience so much more emotional. never have i played a game that had my emotionally invested the entire time while making me feel like i was in the protagonist's shoes.

i also have to add- the fact that the title screen changes during certain points is what i love, games that force you to come face to face with whats going on no matter what is really another way to drive home that you cant escape. 

the true ending with blue skies and sunny, the sunny bad ending where omori has sunny jump off the roof with nothing but blue skies if you open the game. the sunny ending where basil (possibly) kills himself (because if you fought him, he wounds sunny's eye with a gardening tool which can be seen on his fight sprite, he was probably gonna use it on himself.) and you walk out with SOMETHING ('guilt of mari's death') following you causing omori to reappear on the title screen. being in black space causing the white background to turn black and red.. it's all a reminder of the choices you made and the guilt he feels.



it was worth every day of waiting."

OMORI,Indie,1150690,"I adored experiencing this game. The combat was surprisingly fun and engaging despite me sucking at JRPG style games. The story was very touching and the music was so beautiful that I decided to buy the soundtrack before even finishing it. Some parts of the game dragged a bit, especially near the end of the game, though it's atmosphere overall was on point (the contrast between it's happy and terrifying moments meshed very well overall). I'll be thinking about this game for a while... Worth it if you like games that'll likely stick with you, if you open up yourself to it."
OMORI,Indie,1150690,i have never cried so hard
OMORI,Indie,1150690,i still cry over this game
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"A white egret orchid. In the language of flowers, it symbolizes the phrase, “my thoughts will follow you into your dreams"".

A hidden gem, although at times slowed by uneven pacing, OMORI is a story about self-hatred, depression, and the dangers of hiding from the world.
Driven by a past tragedy, Sunny fabricates a wondrous, vibrant childlike world where his alter ego can still hang out and go on adventures with the idealized versions of the childhood friends he has not seen for the past few years. This Whitespace, innocent as it may seem, is still a product of his conscience and imagination, thus Sunny's sense of guilt inevitably starts leaking into it and haunting him. His alter ego, Omori, will chase after the truth behind this guilt, as to uncover it or snuff it out. 
The ramifications of his choices will echo in Sunny's real world, where he may or may not deal with his long lost friends, and his past tragedy, again.
It's not all dark though, with the themes of friendship, healing and sibling love shining brightly through the bleakness.
More on the bittersweet side is the relentless melancholia of the amazing, unforgettable experiences we had as children, looking at the world through our naive, magical, fleeting childish perspectives. Only through growing up we can finally appreciate these memories, and even though those times are gone, we still remain.

The game itself has a classic turn based combat system, based on three different emotions: Anger, Sadness and Happiness, each affecting different stats. Managing your party's and the enemy's emotion will usually be the main drive behind fights. Speaking of which, that's where the game's art is highlighted the most. Omori and his friends are depicted in -sublime- and expressive portraits, reacting to their emotions and to the fight.
This is accompanied by the manifold of different enemies, each with their own sprites and battle portraits.
The wonderful soundtrack often takes center stage, with moody nostalgic tunes, outright tearjerkers, and some absolute bangers in a few boss fights.

The content warning at the start is there for a reason, as you'll be transported to some very dark places throughout Sunny/Omori's journey. It is a story about the exploration of trauma after all! It does not use it for trauma's sake, through cheap shock value, but it carefully delves through it, making the darkest moments feel compelling and genuine.

I empathized with Sunny a lot. He's an expressionless kid, but a good listener who cares about his peers.
While (luckily) not being as much of a shut-in like him, I often felt as if I was made of black and white tones myself, a mute spectator in a world of brightly coloured people that couldn't possibly, or so I thought, understand me. Never feeling the inner spark that should have ignited that unknown something I did not have.
It did make me feel sad at times, reminding me that my own passiveness had precluded me from quite a few things, but it also made me smile. You don't need to be the most exuberant one at the table to show, to the others or to yourself, that you care about your loved ones. There's also others, less extroverted ways, and there is nothing fundamentally flawed with you.
So, if you were/are one of the quiet kids, play this! you should be able to connect with Sunny more than you might think.



While it isn't a perfect game, the amount of love poured into this work is apparent for all to see, palpable in every detail, every interaction, every beautiful drawing.

OMORI,Indie,1150690,"game hits too close to home
except the part where he has friends"
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"OMORI is a psychological horror roleplaying game which should be experienced with little to no prior knowledge of its story. It tackles dark topics which include depression, anxiety, and suicide, as per warnings. As such, this review will be avoiding anything that would be deemed too much of a spoiler past the first hour of the game, but I would highly recommend playing the game yourself first.

What OMORI does extremely well with its storytelling is the gradual buildup from the foundation up. You know that the game is a psychological horror with topics like depression, anxiety, and suicide, but you have no idea how and when they fit into the story. While everything may seem cheerful and upbeat in the beginning, you will slowly be shown pieces of the other side, which recurs throughout the game. This leaves a lot of mystery in the beginning, allowing room for speculation on what is happening around you. However, a clearer picture does form quite literally the further you get into the game, and leads to a great climactic ending that pays off all the buildup.

As a story that heavily revolves around the characters present in the game, OMORI does an amazing job at having a cast of characters that you can really care about and can also relate to. They all have their own unique personality albeit exaggerated, which fits in with the grand scheme of things. You will be able to see the character dynamic they have with one another, and how they change throughout the story given the situation. One big thing OMORI hits home on is if you can relate to the main character; through its portrayal of depression, anxiety, and suicide, the game does a great job revolving around how those topics can have a lasting impact. That is not to say that you must have experienced those emotions before to love OMORI, but it can be extremely relatable to those who have.

The story and characters in OMORI are brought together by the visual and auditory charm the game exerts. All the soundtracks are bangers and fit their respective occurrences, ranging from relaxing exploration music to intense boss battle themes that go hard. They are definitely memorable, especially the ones at key moments throughout the game that will leave you thinking about them in the future. As for the artstyle, the pencil drawing the game uses has a unique charm to it that really fits with the story and characters in OMORI. It was always great to see it during combat and cutscenes.

OMORI’s combat is in the form of a turn-based RPG, which was a genre I was not the biggest fan of. That being said, I found the combat to be pretty enjoyable regardless as it had a decent amount of variety in what you could do with it. There are emotion states for your characters and enemies, which added a layer of strategy to plan for and play around. This is on top of the various skills and equipment you would unlock throughout the game, rewarding you for exploring the world. One thing that really kept my attention with the combat was the pencil artstyle; the characters and their varying expressions were always a joy to see, especially when they were at different emotional levels. The attacks you have were also great in that sense, like the headbutt’s animation.

If there was one thing to criticize about the game OMORI, it is the pacing issue it has. Oftentimes I found areas to be drawn out a bit too long, especially when trying to interact with everything in the game. It can feel nonsensical at times when it is not directly related to the main story, but I was personally fine with it as you were introduced to more side characters and soundtracks. This will become an issue though if you decide to run the game again for alternate endings and/or going for a full completion, as the combat starts getting old alongside the pacing issues.

I really enjoyed playing through OMORI, and it is a game I will be remembering for a long time. It has had quite the impact on me through the story it tells and also the message it ultimately delivers, and I have been thinking about it the past few days. This was a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the game, and it was a blast to experience the highs and lows with the main cast of characters. I would definitely recommend this game in a heartbeat."
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"my day be so fine

then boom,"
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"Fantastic game, It broke me down and then lifted me back up. It'll play with your emotions and make you feel VERY uncomfortable at times. But there are times it'll make you feel very warm.

It's a masterpiece.

OMORI,Indie,1150690,"A highly anticipated JRPG for multiple years in the making with lots of love and detail that is visible to see in the experience and joy you would have from playing this game. This is not Undertale with pacifist endings and whatnot but a story of a boy and his friends. 

I personally recommend this game."
OMORI,Indie,1150690,"a wonderful game, i've waited 6 years and nearly turned 18 by the time it released.
i've had a blast playing it, i spent months delaying finishing it because i didn't want to rush, but the ending was more emotional than i could have ever expected. i suggest playing it blind, on my first run i got the true ending with the secret cutscene at the end. once you've done a full run i totally recommend going to the other endings and route.

omori's endings are def well done, as they're able to make you feel the full weight of what you've done and how your choices led you to what ending you got. i also love how it also gives you enough room to think about your own ending when it comes to the true ending.

but one thing is clear, omori is a game about trauma,guilt,friendships,love and forgiveness.
omori is most certainly a game about how forgiveness isn't always easy. that forgiveness towards yourself is probably the most difficult and perhaps the hardest thing to do,how no matter if someone else forgives you or not all you can do is ask for it and accept what happens in hope of finding peace.

a game about how mistakes can turn a person's life around,how mistakes can burden you and warp your mind. a game about how sometimes, you have to face the truth if you want to find peace.
and most certainly, a game about how doing something bad does not make you a bad person and that no one can punish you more than you already punish yourself.

Noita,RPG,881100,"This game is not easy, it does not hold your hand. It rewards knowledge of the game but doesn't teach you much. There are hundreds and hundreds of hours to be played that you'd never have a clue existed even after having ""beaten"" the game. You learn something new almost every time you die in some new crazy way. If you want to be powerful, look up how to build videos on how to build wands. If you want to know the secrets don't feel bad for looking them up, the odds of finding them are so insane that even knowing how to do it, it's still a rewarding journey. Highly recommended, one of my favorite games to play when playing alone, I have well over 1,000 hours, most of them are offline due to the fact that it makes janky custom modding easier without steam checking files."
Noita,RPG,881100,"When I first heard of Noita, I kinda dismissed it as a Terraria clone with some cool physics stuff. What I got when I looked under the cover was one of the deepest and endlessly replayable gaming experiences I've ever had.

Of course, the physics stuff is a big part of the Noita experience, but I guess I'd describe Noita more like an alchemical rpg with permadeath. I'm hesistant to call it a roguelike because I feel like that term is a bit reductive, and doesn't really sum up the gameplay loop of Noita in a satisfying way to me. Forgive the comparison but Noita has a darksouls-esque crypticness to it. You're thrown into a vast 2D open world with semi-procedural environments loaded with secrets. The obvious path is to go into the dungeon and keep going deeper until you reach the 'final boss', but there are so many secret objectives, secret locations, secret bosses and secret endings to be found if you go off the beaten path, which the game encourages you to do.

One of the biggest features that isn't publcized enough is this game has an incredibly deep wand and spell-crafting system. Every wand you pick up has different stats that determine how spells are cast, and how fast and regularly they are cast. In safe zones you have the ability to tinker with wands by removing and adding spells from the wand's slots, which all interact in a way that's almost reminiscent of coding more than crafting. This comes from the minds of Baba is You, and as you might expect you can create absolutely insane combinations of spells that can come out in an infinite number of ways. By the endgame you'll have a rapidfire wand that conjures rapidfire lightning bolts that jump from enemy to enemy and freeze them, or a wand that summons goats that launch nukes that home on enemies. It's really insane what's possible in this game, it makes every playthrough exciting and unique. The game encourages you to find ways to break it.

Something that is really emblematic of Noita's design is the fact that the game's saferooms you find the in dungeon typically close off when you leave them. But if you have certain spells, you can dig through the walls of the saferoom and make a tunnel to allow you to come back whenever you want. This isn't an exploit, because when you do the game punishes you by summoning a powerful messenger of the Gods to stop your exploits. It lets players control the way they want to play while presenting interesting risks to the potential rewards of breaking the typical flow of the game.

This is all just scratching the surface though. This game is deceptively massive, and I feel like I'm going to be playing it for a long time, and that's before even getting into the huge number of mods. What a fantastic game, unlike anything I've ever really played before.

Also btw there's a pseudo-Multiplayer mod that's really fun to play with friends. Check out 'Noita Together'."

I can't wait to kill myself with it."
Noita,RPG,881100,This game is ruining my life.
Noita,RPG,881100,"It's the sort of a game where you get told how to move your character and that's it for tutorial
It's a rogue-like game, but where you can't upgrade different things in-between the runs like in Rogue Legacy, unlocking new classes or buffs, or new starting items like in Isaac. No, it's a game where you die - you lose everything. The only thing you've earnt is a bit more knowledge about the game.
It's a game where you walk up to an empty shrine where you're supposed to find a wand, think to yourself - ""Aw man, the heck? Some shrines spawn empty?""
And then outta nowhere a giant saw disc flies into you, butchering you for more than half of your hp
After what you learn that enemies may equip your weapons if they find them first.
It's the game where you find out that some enemies bleed lava instead of blood by dying to a corpse which suddenly started acting like a beautiful lava fountain, sprinking orange liquid of death and pain everywhere around it
It's the sort of a game where you learn that some enemies explode after, most likely, dying to them 'cause you didn't see them shoot stuff so you let them come too close.
It's the sort of a game where where you can spend over 50 hours in it, start a new game thinking that ""Well, damn, I spend so much time in this stuff, SURELY I won't die like a dumbass 'cause of a silly mistake"", forgetting that the dungeon might spawn one of the toughest flying monsters in-game on the first floor of the dungeon just because.
Or perphaps a shotgunner who'd die in 1 shot from your magic wand broke a polymorph potion while shooting at another enemy, transformed into a magical worm monster from the last stage of the game and spooked the hell out of you, literally.
And of course we can't forget about you simply walking into the dungeon and seeing ""YOU HAVE ANGERED THE GODS"", wondering what the HECK does that mean
And then getting slaughtered like a pig in a butcher house by a spooky flying skeleton with a magical shield which repels all your projectiles and who can spam slightly homing magical fireballs at the same time
'cause game spawned Worms and they decided to ignore the worm crystal and ruin the Holy Mountain.
It's a game where you spawn
And sometimes
Something already explodes in the mines underneath you
It's a game where you can complete a normal run in around 16 first hours of the game
Then remember that you can eat enemy's corpses
And decide - ""Bruh, screw that boss for almost killing me, I'll show it that I eat such creatures for breakfast LITERALLY, I AIN'T going into no final portals till I devour its whole corpse""
And then you learn that you can explode by overeating, ruin your best run so far, and fail to reach the final boss in the next 20+ hours
It's a game where you can get ""Victory"" achievement after spending 70+ hours in it, just like I did.
And yet ya'd be proud of it.
11/10, not enough deaths 'cause of shooting lightning into an enemy and hitting liquid that flew from above at that moment, making it explode in your own ass instead
The game is pretty fun and enjoyable, albeit it takes a bit of time to get into it and learn the mechanics.
However, once you get into it you can truly enjoy them due to various perk combinations or wand tinkering, letting you put the spells you yourself want to see onto the best wand you can find.
I, for one, truly enjoy the beauty of perks making dead enemies turn into friendly rats and mushroom kamikazes
Gives you a tiny-weenie bit of that necromancer feeling
Which is exploitable as well, since the creatures you summon this way can spawn more creatures if you kill them yourself before enemies get them.
Can't say that this game is without cons, however, which are pretty much what I've mentioned above for me - 
The game may decide that you are having too much of a blast and spawn almost unkillable enemies at the start due to weird algorythm.
Enemies may steal wands from shrines, and then you could just fail to find them 'cause they'd die somewhere near sand or lava and drop it into them
Or they may simply annihilate you 'cause, duh, you have a starting wand and they get some ultra Harry Potter stuff.
The game plays itself as well, especially with perks for more hatred between enemies, and sometimes it gets angry at YOU for not restarting the run after hearing some quakes, since worms can eat through terrain
And, the most important con of all for some people, perphaps
Even after reading the wiki and guides I still don't get what some things do.
Still, I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of random dungeon generation and explosions"
Noita,RPG,881100,"Noita is cruel, but if you can look past that you'll experience a truly amazing game. For the short amount of time I've played Noita I've probably had around 10 mental breakdowns, but after each breakdown you learn more about the games' systems and the puzzles within it. Knowing that I have more things to look forward to and more unlocks within my next run adds a sense of excitement that's unbeatable. Along with all of the normal spells and other things to unlock during runs the game also serves as basically a puzzle game with EXTREMELY deep lore. Noita is Noita which means sometimes you'll get killed by things completely out of your control, but at the end of the day Noita is a super fun game."
Noita,RPG,881100,fun but way too hard
Noita,RPG,881100,"The games roguelite aspect makes up only a smaller part of the whole game. There is a large amount of content in the form of secrets. Secrets in general are good, but Noita is particularly pretentious with it's secrets in that they are incredibly well hidden to the point where the vast majority of players will never know exist. The game tells you nothing, at all. And in the rare chance you stumble across one of these secrets you'll likely die instantly completely wasting your time. The actual base idea with spells and simulated particles is great, but I'd recommend another roguelite if you want to play a game that doesn't require a PHD in Noita lore and 10+ hours on a single run (where you can die instantly through no fault of your own any time)."
Noita,RPG,881100,maybe the real noita was the friends we made along the way
Noita,RPG,881100,"I don't understand a damn thing about what's going on. All I know is that I'm some wizard going through procedurally generated biomes on the hunt for spells, wands, all that fun shit, and everything is out to kill you. The world itself is out to kill you. Everything burns. Everything melts. Your spells are out to kill you. It's hard as shit, but it's fun."

Different things are for different people, and though I count myself as a huge fan of pretty much everything this game uses as inspiration; I am sorely disappointed by Noita.

Without putting in the time to double or triple my hours; it's hard to explain exactly what is wrong here, but there are a few points I feel are consistently negative on my gameplay experience that have overall driven me to drop Noita.

-Shuffle wands suck. The game is built around picking up wands, and applying spells to them to cause them to produce a useful effect. This can be very fun, but some wands have a stat that is enabled called ""Shuffle"". This causes the spells slotted into the wand to trigger in a random order. This regularly ruins that feel-good feeling of 'programming' your wands to do some interesting, and often-times smithing extremely effective weapons.

-Spell Saturation. Noita certainly takes the rogue-like/lite approach of creating an immense number of items, or spells. The problem here was clear in some of my earliest runs. The shops where you can acquire these spells have many options, and will hardly ever offer anything that will syngergize with any kind of 'build' you might have going.

-Painfully slow to get full rewards. As a minor spoiler, the game doubles the amount of gold (used for buying upgrades) when you kill enemies ""by accident"". You can create said accidents by killing enemies indirectly by burning/poisoning, crushing, drowning, etc... The problem with this is that its extremely boring. Ignite an enemy; wait for him to burn. Smother and enemy with liquid, wait for them to suffocate. You can obviously avoid this mechanic, but knowing you are missing out on doubled rewards on every kill feels bad.

I will likely play Noita a little more to see if anything clicks. But the problems listed above are more than enough to drive me away from recommending it specifically to anyone who feels that these issues may turn them away."
Noita,RPG,881100,"Too hard for most people

(edit) ... and I'm not:
- making any progress
- having much fun or 
- getting any further in the last x runs

I know there is a lot of content in this game. I would love to actually become op with some item combination and break out of the standard levels into the huge zones that apparently exist outside of it.

But the game does not help me to achieve this *at all* there, it just kills me with random stuff."
Noita,RPG,881100,its just like fortnite
Noita,RPG,881100,"This game is not easy, it does not hold your hand. It rewards knowledge of the game but doesn't teach you much. There are hundreds and hundreds of hours to be played that you'd never have a clue existed even after having ""beaten"" the game. You learn something new almost every time you die in some new crazy way. If you want to be powerful, look up how to build videos on how to build wands. If you want to know the secrets don't feel bad for looking them up, the odds of finding them are so insane that even knowing how to do it, it's still a rewarding journey. Highly recommended, one of my favorite games to play when playing alone, I have well over 1,000 hours, most of them are offline due to the fact that it makes janky custom modding easier without steam checking files."
Noita,RPG,881100,"When I first heard of Noita, I kinda dismissed it as a Terraria clone with some cool physics stuff. What I got when I looked under the cover was one of the deepest and endlessly replayable gaming experiences I've ever had.

Of course, the physics stuff is a big part of the Noita experience, but I guess I'd describe Noita more like an alchemical rpg with permadeath. I'm hesistant to call it a roguelike because I feel like that term is a bit reductive, and doesn't really sum up the gameplay loop of Noita in a satisfying way to me. Forgive the comparison but Noita has a darksouls-esque crypticness to it. You're thrown into a vast 2D open world with semi-procedural environments loaded with secrets. The obvious path is to go into the dungeon and keep going deeper until you reach the 'final boss', but there are so many secret objectives, secret locations, secret bosses and secret endings to be found if you go off the beaten path, which the game encourages you to do.

One of the biggest features that isn't publcized enough is this game has an incredibly deep wand and spell-crafting system. Every wand you pick up has different stats that determine how spells are cast, and how fast and regularly they are cast. In safe zones you have the ability to tinker with wands by removing and adding spells from the wand's slots, which all interact in a way that's almost reminiscent of coding more than crafting. This comes from the minds of Baba is You, and as you might expect you can create absolutely insane combinations of spells that can come out in an infinite number of ways. By the endgame you'll have a rapidfire wand that conjures rapidfire lightning bolts that jump from enemy to enemy and freeze them, or a wand that summons goats that launch nukes that home on enemies. It's really insane what's possible in this game, it makes every playthrough exciting and unique. The game encourages you to find ways to break it.

Something that is really emblematic of Noita's design is the fact that the game's saferooms you find the in dungeon typically close off when you leave them. But if you have certain spells, you can dig through the walls of the saferoom and make a tunnel to allow you to come back whenever you want. This isn't an exploit, because when you do the game punishes you by summoning a powerful messenger of the Gods to stop your exploits. It lets players control the way they want to play while presenting interesting risks to the potential rewards of breaking the typical flow of the game.

This is all just scratching the surface though. This game is deceptively massive, and I feel like I'm going to be playing it for a long time, and that's before even getting into the huge number of mods. What a fantastic game, unlike anything I've ever really played before.

Also btw there's a pseudo-Multiplayer mod that's really fun to play with friends. Check out 'Noita Together'."
Noita,RPG,881100,You'll die and shut the game in a fit of rage. 5 mins later you'll be back to the game.
Noita,RPG,881100,"The real difficulty spike was inside us all along.

Much like everything else that was inside us, it's somewhere over there now."
Noita,RPG,881100,"Oh my god, this wand is so strong. 
I can't wait to kill myself with it."
Noita,RPG,881100,This game is ruining my life.
Noita,RPG,881100,"It's the sort of a game where you get told how to move your character and that's it for tutorial
It's a rogue-like game, but where you can't upgrade different things in-between the runs like in Rogue Legacy, unlocking new classes or buffs, or new starting items like in Isaac. No, it's a game where you die - you lose everything. The only thing you've earnt is a bit more knowledge about the game.
It's a game where you walk up to an empty shrine where you're supposed to find a wand, think to yourself - ""Aw man, the heck? Some shrines spawn empty?""
And then outta nowhere a giant saw disc flies into you, butchering you for more than half of your hp
After what you learn that enemies may equip your weapons if they find them first.
It's the game where you find out that some enemies bleed lava instead of blood by dying to a corpse which suddenly started acting like a beautiful lava fountain, sprinking orange liquid of death and pain everywhere around it
It's the sort of a game where you learn that some enemies explode after, most likely, dying to them 'cause you didn't see them shoot stuff so you let them come too close.
It's the sort of a game where where you can spend over 50 hours in it, start a new game thinking that ""Well, damn, I spend so much time in this stuff, SURELY I won't die like a dumbass 'cause of a silly mistake"", forgetting that the dungeon might spawn one of the toughest flying monsters in-game on the first floor of the dungeon just because.
Or perphaps a shotgunner who'd die in 1 shot from your magic wand broke a polymorph potion while shooting at another enemy, transformed into a magical worm monster from the last stage of the game and spooked the hell out of you, literally.
And of course we can't forget about you simply walking into the dungeon and seeing ""YOU HAVE ANGERED THE GODS"", wondering what the HECK does that mean
And then getting slaughtered like a pig in a butcher house by a spooky flying skeleton with a magical shield which repels all your projectiles and who can spam slightly homing magical fireballs at the same time
'cause game spawned Worms and they decided to ignore the worm crystal and ruin the Holy Mountain.
It's a game where you spawn
And sometimes
Something already explodes in the mines underneath you
It's a game where you can complete a normal run in around 16 first hours of the game
Then remember that you can eat enemy's corpses
And decide - ""Bruh, screw that boss for almost killing me, I'll show it that I eat such creatures for breakfast LITERALLY, I AIN'T going into no final portals till I devour its whole corpse""
And then you learn that you can explode by overeating, ruin your best run so far, and fail to reach the final boss in the next 20+ hours
It's a game where you can get ""Victory"" achievement after spending 70+ hours in it, just like I did.
And yet ya'd be proud of it.
11/10, not enough deaths 'cause of shooting lightning into an enemy and hitting liquid that flew from above at that moment, making it explode in your own ass instead
The game is pretty fun and enjoyable, albeit it takes a bit of time to get into it and learn the mechanics.
However, once you get into it you can truly enjoy them due to various perk combinations or wand tinkering, letting you put the spells you yourself want to see onto the best wand you can find.
I, for one, truly enjoy the beauty of perks making dead enemies turn into friendly rats and mushroom kamikazes
Gives you a tiny-weenie bit of that necromancer feeling
Which is exploitable as well, since the creatures you summon this way can spawn more creatures if you kill them yourself before enemies get them.
Can't say that this game is without cons, however, which are pretty much what I've mentioned above for me - 
The game may decide that you are having too much of a blast and spawn almost unkillable enemies at the start due to weird algorythm.
Enemies may steal wands from shrines, and then you could just fail to find them 'cause they'd die somewhere near sand or lava and drop it into them
Or they may simply annihilate you 'cause, duh, you have a starting wand and they get some ultra Harry Potter stuff.
The game plays itself as well, especially with perks for more hatred between enemies, and sometimes it gets angry at YOU for not restarting the run after hearing some quakes, since worms can eat through terrain
And, the most important con of all for some people, perphaps
Even after reading the wiki and guides I still don't get what some things do.
Still, I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of random dungeon generation and explosions"
Noita,RPG,881100,"Noita is cruel, but if you can look past that you'll experience a truly amazing game. For the short amount of time I've played Noita I've probably had around 10 mental breakdowns, but after each breakdown you learn more about the games' systems and the puzzles within it. Knowing that I have more things to look forward to and more unlocks within my next run adds a sense of excitement that's unbeatable. Along with all of the normal spells and other things to unlock during runs the game also serves as basically a puzzle game with EXTREMELY deep lore. Noita is Noita which means sometimes you'll get killed by things completely out of your control, but at the end of the day Noita is a super fun game."
Noita,RPG,881100,"Too hard for most people

(edit) ... and I'm not:
- making any progress
- having much fun or 
- getting any further in the last x runs

I know there is a lot of content in this game. I would love to actually become op with some item combination and break out of the standard levels into the huge zones that apparently exist outside of it.

But the game does not help me to achieve this *at all* there, it just kills me with random stuff."
Noita,RPG,881100,"The games roguelite aspect makes up only a smaller part of the whole game. There is a large amount of content in the form of secrets. Secrets in general are good, but Noita is particularly pretentious with it's secrets in that they are incredibly well hidden to the point where the vast majority of players will never know exist. The game tells you nothing, at all. And in the rare chance you stumble across one of these secrets you'll likely die instantly completely wasting your time. The actual base idea with spells and simulated particles is great, but I'd recommend another roguelite if you want to play a game that doesn't require a PHD in Noita lore and 10+ hours on a single run (where you can die instantly through no fault of your own any time)."
Noita,RPG,881100,fun but way too hard
Noita,RPG,881100,"Don't get me wrong the game has a great concept and incredibly interesting mechanics. However I do not think that they in any way excuse the issues with the game. For starters it is horridly optimized, I understand that everything is simulated, but there have been and will be other games that simulate everything on the screen and they never seem to run as poorly as this. You will die to things completely out of your control, and it will happen constantly (don't you ""get good"" me I've already finished the main game). For a game that seems to pride itself on its exploration of secrets, environments, and spells it loves to go out of its way to punish you for tinkering and exploring. Such as no and I do mean no reliable way to heal. To heal RELIABLY (i know there are more ways then these) you need to rely on rng to give you either a seed with easy ingredients for Lively Concoction, or the right spells to create an infinite healing wand. I have 86 hours in this game at the time of writing and have never been able to make an infinite healing wand. Where other rougelite games will keep their rules so that you may learn from your mistakes for the next run. Noita will often break its own rules just to fuck with you, the simplest example being that some spells will act as static spells even when they are labeled as projectile spells."
Noita,RPG,881100,maybe the real noita was the friends we made along the way
Noita,RPG,881100,"I don't understand a damn thing about what's going on. All I know is that I'm some wizard going through procedurally generated biomes on the hunt for spells, wands, all that fun shit, and everything is out to kill you. The world itself is out to kill you. Everything burns. Everything melts. Your spells are out to kill you. It's hard as shit, but it's fun."
Noita,RPG,881100,This game sucks.  10/10
Noita,RPG,881100,Top de los mejores juegos de la historia de la humanidad entera.
Noita,RPG,881100,"Лучший симулятор суицида в стиме и power fantasy получше дума.

Rivals of Aether,Indie,383980,workshop gives us mii brawler so yeah pretty good game
Rivals of Aether,Indie,383980,"Making a good fighter is no easy feat, and rest assured that the designer of Rivals of Aether, Dan Fornace, did a great job. The mechanics are well designed and the game feels incredibly tight to play; but what bothers me about Rivals of Aether is that it dives headfirst into all the competitive aspects of fighting games and leaves everything else behind. To put it bluntly, RoA lacks anything to make it appealing to those who DON’T have an interest in joining it’s competitive scene.

For starters, the single player content in the game is very sparse. The only things for players to do are the story mode, which in all honesty isn’t very good (like most fighting games it’s just a series of fights separated by cutscenes and I didn’t find the story itself very well written) and abyss mode, which is somewhat similar to the multi-man battles present in Super Smash Bros. The game also added a new feature called the “milestone” system recently but all it does is offer cosmetic unlocks after reaching certain gameplay milestones. If you’re already struggling to find enjoyment in the game, being asked to get 250 KOs with a certain character to unlock a skin isn’t going to make it more fun.

Because of the niche nature of indie fighters on Steam, the online for this game is understandably small. When queuing for matches in both ranked and casual my experience was often the same: I would get matched with someone who had much more practice than me (often people who had been playing since Early Access) and would usually only be able to get one stock off of them before the match was over. Rivals of Aether has an official discord you can use to link up for matches with players more akin to your skill level but not everyone is going to want to join or use that. There’s also a fairly robust in-game tutorial but without having someone at your level to fight with it’s hard to put what you learn into practice.

I will admit that one of RoA’s coolest features though is its workshop modding support. I’m a game dev myself and tried my hand at modding a character in and had a really good time (I didn’t ever get around to finishing and uploading them but it was still really fun tinkering around in the game’s engine!) The community has also made some really cool characters and stages so there’s a wealth of content to check out in that department!

Oftentimes people equate a “Not Recommended” rating on Steam with someone saying a game is bad, but to be entirely honest, that isn’t how I feel about Rivals of Aether. RoA is a great experience if you love the competitive aspects of fighters or are already invested in the competitive Super Smash Bros. community. If you’re like me though and you like to have casual content to turn to when you get tired of intense competition, there’s very little here. Rivals is a game I REALLY wanted to like, and over the past few years I’ve played it off and on, but every time I tried to get into it again I would get burned because of this and put it back down.

Dan and the Rivals team are currently working on a sequel to the game (which is making the exciting jump to 3D!) so if they ever see this review I just have one critique: please add more single-player content. I think that with more modes to play aside from competitive online, RoA could be enjoyed by a much wider audience and be a lot more fun."

我是一个简单的人，我看到有人做塑料椅维吉尔的mod，所以买来只为了抛瓦
等到打折再买的，因为我不认为一个mugen值90
买游戏之前在了解游戏相关信息的时候，不乏游戏激进纯净粉丝反感我们这些乱打mod玩的，但鉴于这游戏一半以上的好评都是由mod功能引申的，我暂且放心辣评
玩过拳皇街霸，真人快打，铁拳死生等不计其数的ftg，我坚持认为带乱斗ftg算不上正经ftg，游戏乐趣对我而言是跟朋友联远程畅玩然后瞎打mod嘻嘻哈哈，尤其是对方也懂梗的时候，生草程度拉满，游戏体验极佳，我推荐这款游戏

Not usually on this account. Most of the time I play on my main account via Steam Share instead
I'm a simple man. I see Vergil Chair mod, I purchase. Although it was until recently when this game was on sale I decided to buy it since I don't think a mugen is worth 30$.
Jokes aside, Before owning this game, I did a lot of research on it and judging by the game's community and comment sections from multiple vids, here's my conclusion
Average vanilla fans be like: you modded players are annoying
Average mod enjoyers be like: haha sans with a gun go brrrr
Since this game gets half of its thumbs-up from mod players. I think it's safe to post my hot take here:
I've played Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Street Fighters and many other fighting games. Yet I still don't take these Smash-Bros-alike as real fighting games. The game is fun because it provided me of a method to play with friends and to mess around. Especially when they understand the references or memes in these mods. It's joyful and I absolutely love it"

Rivals of Aether,Indie,383980,workshop gives us mii brawler so yeah pretty good game
Rivals of Aether,Indie,383980,"Making a good fighter is no easy feat, and rest assured that the designer of Rivals of Aether, Dan Fornace, did a great job. The mechanics are well designed and the game feels incredibly tight to play; but what bothers me about Rivals of Aether is that it dives headfirst into all the competitive aspects of fighting games and leaves everything else behind. To put it bluntly, RoA lacks anything to make it appealing to those who DON’T have an interest in joining it’s competitive scene.

For starters, the single player content in the game is very sparse. The only things for players to do are the story mode, which in all honesty isn’t very good (like most fighting games it’s just a series of fights separated by cutscenes and I didn’t find the story itself very well written) and abyss mode, which is somewhat similar to the multi-man battles present in Super Smash Bros. The game also added a new feature called the “milestone” system recently but all it does is offer cosmetic unlocks after reaching certain gameplay milestones. If you’re already struggling to find enjoyment in the game, being asked to get 250 KOs with a certain character to unlock a skin isn’t going to make it more fun.

Because of the niche nature of indie fighters on Steam, the online for this game is understandably small. When queuing for matches in both ranked and casual my experience was often the same: I would get matched with someone who had much more practice than me (often people who had been playing since Early Access) and would usually only be able to get one stock off of them before the match was over. Rivals of Aether has an official discord you can use to link up for matches with players more akin to your skill level but not everyone is going to want to join or use that. There’s also a fairly robust in-game tutorial but without having someone at your level to fight with it’s hard to put what you learn into practice.

I will admit that one of RoA’s coolest features though is its workshop modding support. I’m a game dev myself and tried my hand at modding a character in and had a really good time (I didn’t ever get around to finishing and uploading them but it was still really fun tinkering around in the game’s engine!) The community has also made some really cool characters and stages so there’s a wealth of content to check out in that department!

Oftentimes people equate a “Not Recommended” rating on Steam with someone saying a game is bad, but to be entirely honest, that isn’t how I feel about Rivals of Aether. RoA is a great experience if you love the competitive aspects of fighters or are already invested in the competitive Super Smash Bros. community. If you’re like me though and you like to have casual content to turn to when you get tired of intense competition, there’s very little here. Rivals is a game I REALLY wanted to like, and over the past few years I’ve played it off and on, but every time I tried to get into it again I would get burned because of this and put it back down.

Dan and the Rivals team are currently working on a sequel to the game (which is making the exciting jump to 3D!) so if they ever see this review I just have one critique: please add more single-player content. I think that with more modes to play aside from competitive online, RoA could be enjoyed by a much wider audience and be a lot more fun."

Rivals of Aether,Indie,383980,"小号不常登陆，买来共享给大号玩的
我是一个简单的人，我看到有人做塑料椅维吉尔的mod，所以买来只为了抛瓦
等到打折再买的，因为我不认为一个mugen值90
买游戏之前在了解游戏相关信息的时候，不乏游戏激进纯净粉丝反感我们这些乱打mod玩的，但鉴于这游戏一半以上的好评都是由mod功能引申的，我暂且放心辣评
玩过拳皇街霸，真人快打，铁拳死生等不计其数的ftg，我坚持认为带乱斗ftg算不上正经ftg，游戏乐趣对我而言是跟朋友联远程畅玩然后瞎打mod嘻嘻哈哈，尤其是对方也懂梗的时候，生草程度拉满，游戏体验极佳，我推荐这款游戏

Not usually on this account. Most of the time I play on my main account via Steam Share instead
I'm a simple man. I see Vergil Chair mod, I purchase. Although it was until recently when this game was on sale I decided to buy it since I don't think a mugen is worth 30$.
Jokes aside, Before owning this game, I did a lot of research on it and judging by the game's community and comment sections from multiple vids, here's my conclusion
Average vanilla fans be like: you modded players are annoying
Average mod enjoyers be like: haha sans with a gun go brrrr
Since this game gets half of its thumbs-up from mod players. I think it's safe to post my hot take here:
I've played Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Street Fighters and many other fighting games. Yet I still don't take these Smash-Bros-alike as real fighting games. The game is fun because it provided me of a method to play with friends and to mess around. Especially when they understand the references or memes in these mods. It's joyful and I absolutely love it"

Bastion,Indie,107100,"Bastion is a delightful game which was extremely fun to play. The narrator is top notch and keeps you longing for what's next. The OST is also very good.

Bastion,Indie,107100,"A game with impeccable storytelling, beautiful art, captivating music, unique weapons, exciting challenges and satisfying ending.

Even ten years later: a masterpiece."
Bastion,Indie,107100,"There are some games that play at the edges of your memories years after you have played them.  Games that, even when you may run across levels that feel excessively difficult, you want nothing more than to complete it and allow the melancholy-filled satisfaction to flow.  Bastion is a pleasing game visually, audibly, and story-wise, with game mechanics that are both challenging and easy to utilize.  There are some bumpy rides throughout but nothing that cannot be overcome with some time and focus.  There is a smoothness to the pacing that feels right—you go from fast action to a, well, bastion of peace where you recover and steady yourself for the next fight, uncovering and building up an existence for you and…others.  The story that unweaves is incredible, with voice talent so compelling that you can’t get the narrator’s voice out of your head.  And you won’t want to.

If you are not used to this kind of gameplay but are willing to try it, Bastion is a great introduction.  Pick up the soundtrack while you are at it—it is unique."

The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"So, this is going to be a bit long but I'll try to break things up in to categories for those that even care to read.
[h1] Pros: [/h1] 
1) I paid $8 for the game on sale a while back. I've played almost 300 hours.
2) Said $8 buys you a fair number of zones to explore, all of which scale to your character level - go anywhere, do anything, right from the start.
3) The community is usually friendly and helpful. You meet the occasional troll, they become more common as you explore further from starting areas, but more or less people are willing to provide helpful information if you ask in zone chat which is more than can be said about several other MMO's I've played.

[h1] Cons [/h1] 
1) [b] Crafting: [/b]
   I've played almost 300 hours but have accomplished almost nothing in game. I can't even craft a suit of what is considered ENTRY level armor having reached max level. With research speed maxed out it still takes around 12 real world days to research one piece of gear enough to craft a set item, you can research three items at once (with max research) and there are nine slots to fill for an ""entry"" level build to start powering up towards ""end game"" content. This means roughly 36 real life days of time must pass (likely more, as research may finish while you sleep, etc) to make your own stuff.

You also can't craft, research, or disassemble jewelry unless you buy the Summerset Chapter, or pay for ESO+ which leads me to my next topic.

Oh, and if you instead want to try and buy gear (which is insanely expensive to those starting out) there is no centralized market or Auction House. Instead you have individual Guild Traders that will let you browse items posted by the members of that Guild. This can be anything in game that isn't Bound to your character or account. With hundreds of Traders, that can have pretty much any item under the sun, spread out across all the zones in the game you have to rely on third party websites and addons to search for items that may or may not still be present by the time you travel to whichever zone and town that Guild Trader is in. It turns what should be a three minute shopping trip in to a three hour struggle.

2) [b] Monetization: [/b]
    I'm all for folks getting paid for their work, however publishers tend to push that to the extremes for the sake of their share holders. Monetization in this game feels scummy, bordering on predatory. You want to increase the speed of your mount, how much your mount can help you carry, or how long it can run? Great! Wait 3,600 real life hours (150 days, if you don't miss a single minute of upgrade time, but more realistically 180 days) to reach max attributes or pay real world currency (RWC) for instant upgrades. 

You want to hold all those crafting ingredients so you can (attempt to) make things? Great! Pay for ESO+ so you have access to a crafting storage bag, or constantly be throwing things away as character bag space is limited to 60 slots to start, upgraded with a non-inconsequential amount of gold or (you guessed it!) RWC to 140 slots which sounds like a lot, but for Provisioning (making foods and drinks) alone there are 50 different ingredients. Say you buy the first six bag upgrades to save 2/3rd the gold cost, you'd still spend 2,000 Crowns (~$20 USD) PER CHARACTER to upgrade your bags the last two ranks.

The list goes on but the worst of all (in my opinion) Crown Crates - loot boxes which provide random items upon opening. To make it even more enjoyable those Crown Crate items can be scrapped in to an alternate currency, only obtainable (to my knowledge) by opening Crates, which are used for purchasing other items from the in-game store. Granted, I haven't delved too deeply in to that aspect of things as I do not have any desire to waste money on in-game gambling for pixels but to lock things behind a currency that requires you to gamble seems rapacious.

3) [b] Repetative: [/b]
   Yes, it's an MMO so it's mostly what you make of it however each of your characters has to go through the same Public Dungeons, Delves, Quests, and Zones. Delves, Dungeons and Zone exploration are essentially required to collect Sky Shards which award extra Skill Points (used to learn combat or crafting skills) outside of the Skill points you receive while leveling. You get 64 Skill Points in total by the time you reach level 50 (max character level) however crafting skills alone can require well over 100 Points (ignoring some of the traits I find less useful) meaning you will spend hours and hours grinding. But hey, once you collect all the Sky Shards from a zone you can use RWC to buy those same shard unlocks on an alt to save time. It'll only cost you $5 per zone you've already cleared and with a dozen or so major zones only $60 per character. Yay?

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]
All in all, for $8 it's not a bad game though it does feel like any old generic MMO with an Elder Scrolls skin stretched over top of it. I personally refuse to spend a single penny more on anything else related to this game even though ESO+ feels almost mandatory (+10% gold, XP gains, crafting progression and research, double bank storage space, the ability to actually customize your armor appearance, and more) if you want to actually play without dipping in to your bag every 5 minutes to make space. I am however going to leave this as a negative review as their monetization offends me to such a degree that an otherwise okay game can not be something I recommend to others wholeheartedly but you can't go wrong for $8.

Edited: Typos, I wrote this late at night so forgive me."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"ESO is a fantastic MMO. The community is great, and the game is just stunning. I am an old WOW player from the vanilla days and I remember just going to hilltops or on top of buildings and being in aw of the graphics. I get that feeling again in ESO. Sometimes I just watch the sun set over the water while casting a line in the water. here are some bullet points of why i love ESO.

- use any weapon you want. You want to be a greatsword wielding mage with light armor pants but a heavy helm? ok. sure. you want to craft EVERYTHING? ok. You can get all the crafting lines!
-such a pretty game as I said above. A well put together world 
-quests are not boring like go and kill 20 murlocs. There is always a neat story of why you are doing things, and its never just go kill mobs of X monsters. I spent a while last night just pickpocketing people and running from the law to get into the thieves guild. then I killed some people for the assassins' guild. want to just read books? go to a bookshelf and open one up! 
-LORE. lots of lovely LORE
- mostly free. People that complain about expansions costing money don't know how the world works. You can play this game (besides the actual game cost) for free. there is no real need for paying the month script fees unless you want to get cosmetic items for your or your house. BUT that being said, its a great deal if you want to get levels faster, and you get some crowns thrown in for that sweet sweet flaming dog mount. But, you get a free horse that goes just as fast, so again, you don't have to spend money. 
- you can solo. I am a solo player mostly. I am old and not good at video games, but that's ok. Its not a hard game to play, and most content is solo-able. I will eventually try to join a guild, but I am a filthy casual. dungeon finders work well and I never think I am missing something.

The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,The sewers are full of smelly rat
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"TESO did not come up with anything radically new and actually just dusted off the familiar mechanics of the MMO genre. But it offers them in a greatly improved coat of an otherwise traditional concept and, of course, in the popular world of Tamriel. For some it may be little, for others a sufficient reason to pay monthly fees and have fun.

Jailbreaking and knowing that you have a higher goal is a big cliché in itself. What kind of chosen hero are you when you see dozens of similarly chosen people passing by? In previous The Elder Scrolls games, this model was accepted because it was a singleplayer game. But online with hundreds of thousands of players? And they are all chosen.

Tamriel and his states create the impression of pomp, but later you find out that a large area also suffers from inner emptiness. To some extent, this is due to a graphic concept that lacks the hallmark of originality. The world around is desperately monotonous over time. What bothered me the most was when I came to a town or settlement and found that it looked exactly like the previous one. However, I would expect some specific landmarks or architectural differences - in short, more interesting ideas.

The Elder Scrolls Online is an above-average game, but it expects a great deal of enthusiasm from man for the TES series, world and realities. The better you know Tamriel, the more you will enjoy it. Be sure to try the game, provided you don't normally play much online games or you're a big fan of The Elder Scrolls. I will definitely come back to TESO to see what the updates have done with the game. [b] 70% [/b]"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Great game which I just came back to after some time off, unfortunately to discover they changed the privacy policy while I was away.

 Definitely not buying any DLCs or ESO plus, as you can get the extra money by selling my personal info instead.

Sells your personal info to anyone with the cash, including: ""username, name, demographics and other characteristics or descriptions, email, address, telephone number, and other contact information, account credentials, communications preferences, billing and payment information"".

 Change the privacy policy if you want a positive review, and also give me some compensation for this breach of trust (not a refund, actual COMPENSATION for copy and pasting my personal details all over the internet). Pretty annoyed that I paid for this, for you to later decide it wasn't enough and try to get that extra cash out of my personal details too."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"According to Bethesda, my own country doesn't even exist."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Loved the ending! Reading other reviews some folks complain about the monthly pass price though, largely senior citizens it seems. I stand with them, the pricing model is unfair. For that I have to leave a harsh but fair thumbs down."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"I keep losing my connection from the servers. If that wasn't bad enough, the launcher frequently becomes convinced that all the game's files have disappeared and need to be downloaded all over again, which can take hours. I'd estimate that a third of the time I've spent playing the Elder Scrolls Online has been downloading it over and over again. While the game is fun when it works properly, it's not worth putting up with all that."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"This game is amazing.
World doesn't get old like in other MMORPG's, so questing and exploring is always relevant and rewarding. Endgame is challenging, but it comes without pressure to do it in a haste. Expansions expand the game, but without forcing players out of older zones and content. I'm having the most fun I had in a while. Subscription is optional, and there is so much gameplay freedom.
I wish I had started playing it sooner.

Give it a chance, first levels might be confusing but if you press through them you're gonna fall in love with the ESO journey."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"The blatant greed in this game is getting much worse. I'm fine with buying cosmetics, but they keep hiding them in loot boxes and consistently lowering drop rates, not to mention splitting cosmetic armor into pieces so you have to keep buying to get the whole set. Want to bank on the go? That's $50. Want to buy a house so you can put all those cosmetic items somewhere? $50 to $150 for anything worth buying. Not to mention the subscription of $180 a year without buying the $60 expansion. If you plan on playing for any decent amount of time, the subscription is definitely required, otherwise you lose half your bank space and the crafting bag which is infinite.

Look, love this game and the community, but ZOS is a terrible company who only wants your money. They don't listen to the community and keep jacking up the prices. I only hope Microsoft can fix the mess they've created"

Via account ban.

So after 85 minutes of gameplay I had a single 2-level character in a starting zone with something like 20-26 coins and a bag full of loot, with no guild, no friends, no mail, no chat messages. Not a lot of progress, but hey -- I love to explore a game world, so I spent time crawling into every possible corner of a starting zone (and looting everything around, that's Elder Scrolls after all).
I decided that I like the game, purchaced another copy as a gift for my sister (so we can loot twice more!) and happily turned off my PC and went asleep.
Now, time for magic! I don't remember having a habit of sleepwalking (or sleepgaming). But according to the email I've received from TESO support next morning, they've caught me selling the gold during that night. I've requested them to provide any evidence (I am really into it, because I don't even know how to sell gold -- never thought of it), but received no response.
So... If you are planning for any long-term play, I can not recommend this game."

The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"It's not that it's bad. I just don't recommend it. I am looking for an MMO that feels like an MMO and this just doesn't feel like it's it, not for me anyways. I can basically do everything alone, and I hardly see or feel the need to interact with others. 
I'm only 60 hours in, though. Which by an MMO isn't much. 

I just didn't have the fun with it that I was expecting, but that shouldn't deter you from trying. Especially at the base game's going price- It's worth a shot. 
"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"The game is decent, plenty of interesting dungeons and the combat is better than a few other MMOs i've played.

With that being said i just CAN'T reccomend this game from a collector's point of view. 
If you're expecting to collect plenty of mounts, weapons, minions ecc. you WILL be disappointed. 90% of the mounts are from the crown store, 90% of the pets are from the crown store. Of course, there are a few you can only get by playing, but simply put, they're all s**t compared to the paid ones, apart from a SINGLE mount that's decent looking, BUT, to get it you must do one of the hardest raids in the game! One. Decent. Mount.
Talking about raids, there ARE rewards for doing the end-game content, yes; what could it be? Mounts? Armor? Weapons? No no, you get some cosmetic that changes your character's skin texture. So if your character is fully armored (Like me) you might as well go f*** yourself.

The game has armor and styles, basically:
Armor is the stuff that gives you stats
Styles is what you use to make transmogs, basically consuming a style page unlocks that specific gear piece to be used for transmogs.
There are a few cool styles you can get from PVP, specifically the Xivkyn style. It's basically the Daedric armor from Skyrim, to give you an idea. To get these pages you must grind a lot, with the danger of an enemy player coming in to steal all your progress (You can only get the pages in a specific mode, but i won't be explaining it since it'd be too long), BUT, guess what?! You can just spend a few bucks and you'll get em instantly! Ain't that cool?
HELL, the only way to get a few good houses is to spend money! And i'm not talking about 20/30 bucks no, i'm talking about 90 f***ing dollars! For a digital house!

Do i have to say anything else?


Of course, you CAN get all of this for free if you have a Plus subscription, since you get a bit of crowns every month. Still, that doesn't change anything. Almost nothing in this game has any real value/rarity. I figured this after way too much time, so if you're a collector like me, don't make my mistake, play a better MMO."

The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"So, this is going to be a bit long but I'll try to break things up in to categories for those that even care to read.
[h1] Pros: [/h1] 
1) I paid $8 for the game on sale a while back. I've played almost 300 hours.
2) Said $8 buys you a fair number of zones to explore, all of which scale to your character level - go anywhere, do anything, right from the start.
3) The community is usually friendly and helpful. You meet the occasional troll, they become more common as you explore further from starting areas, but more or less people are willing to provide helpful information if you ask in zone chat which is more than can be said about several other MMO's I've played.

[h1] Cons [/h1] 
1) [b] Crafting: [/b]
   I've played almost 300 hours but have accomplished almost nothing in game. I can't even craft a suit of what is considered ENTRY level armor having reached max level. With research speed maxed out it still takes around 12 real world days to research one piece of gear enough to craft a set item, you can research three items at once (with max research) and there are nine slots to fill for an ""entry"" level build to start powering up towards ""end game"" content. This means roughly 36 real life days of time must pass (likely more, as research may finish while you sleep, etc) to make your own stuff.

You also can't craft, research, or disassemble jewelry unless you buy the Summerset Chapter, or pay for ESO+ which leads me to my next topic.

Oh, and if you instead want to try and buy gear (which is insanely expensive to those starting out) there is no centralized market or Auction House. Instead you have individual Guild Traders that will let you browse items posted by the members of that Guild. This can be anything in game that isn't Bound to your character or account. With hundreds of Traders, that can have pretty much any item under the sun, spread out across all the zones in the game you have to rely on third party websites and addons to search for items that may or may not still be present by the time you travel to whichever zone and town that Guild Trader is in. It turns what should be a three minute shopping trip in to a three hour struggle.

2) [b] Monetization: [/b]
    I'm all for folks getting paid for their work, however publishers tend to push that to the extremes for the sake of their share holders. Monetization in this game feels scummy, bordering on predatory. You want to increase the speed of your mount, how much your mount can help you carry, or how long it can run? Great! Wait 3,600 real life hours (150 days, if you don't miss a single minute of upgrade time, but more realistically 180 days) to reach max attributes or pay real world currency (RWC) for instant upgrades. 

You want to hold all those crafting ingredients so you can (attempt to) make things? Great! Pay for ESO+ so you have access to a crafting storage bag, or constantly be throwing things away as character bag space is limited to 60 slots to start, upgraded with a non-inconsequential amount of gold or (you guessed it!) RWC to 140 slots which sounds like a lot, but for Provisioning (making foods and drinks) alone there are 50 different ingredients. Say you buy the first six bag upgrades to save 2/3rd the gold cost, you'd still spend 2,000 Crowns (~$20 USD) PER CHARACTER to upgrade your bags the last two ranks.

The list goes on but the worst of all (in my opinion) Crown Crates - loot boxes which provide random items upon opening. To make it even more enjoyable those Crown Crate items can be scrapped in to an alternate currency, only obtainable (to my knowledge) by opening Crates, which are used for purchasing other items from the in-game store. Granted, I haven't delved too deeply in to that aspect of things as I do not have any desire to waste money on in-game gambling for pixels but to lock things behind a currency that requires you to gamble seems rapacious.

3) [b] Repetative: [/b]
   Yes, it's an MMO so it's mostly what you make of it however each of your characters has to go through the same Public Dungeons, Delves, Quests, and Zones. Delves, Dungeons and Zone exploration are essentially required to collect Sky Shards which award extra Skill Points (used to learn combat or crafting skills) outside of the Skill points you receive while leveling. You get 64 Skill Points in total by the time you reach level 50 (max character level) however crafting skills alone can require well over 100 Points (ignoring some of the traits I find less useful) meaning you will spend hours and hours grinding. But hey, once you collect all the Sky Shards from a zone you can use RWC to buy those same shard unlocks on an alt to save time. It'll only cost you $5 per zone you've already cleared and with a dozen or so major zones only $60 per character. Yay?

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]
All in all, for $8 it's not a bad game though it does feel like any old generic MMO with an Elder Scrolls skin stretched over top of it. I personally refuse to spend a single penny more on anything else related to this game even though ESO+ feels almost mandatory (+10% gold, XP gains, crafting progression and research, double bank storage space, the ability to actually customize your armor appearance, and more) if you want to actually play without dipping in to your bag every 5 minutes to make space. I am however going to leave this as a negative review as their monetization offends me to such a degree that an otherwise okay game can not be something I recommend to others wholeheartedly but you can't go wrong for $8.

Edited: Typos, I wrote this late at night so forgive me."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"ESO is a fantastic MMO. The community is great, and the game is just stunning. I am an old WOW player from the vanilla days and I remember just going to hilltops or on top of buildings and being in aw of the graphics. I get that feeling again in ESO. Sometimes I just watch the sun set over the water while casting a line in the water. here are some bullet points of why i love ESO.

- use any weapon you want. You want to be a greatsword wielding mage with light armor pants but a heavy helm? ok. sure. you want to craft EVERYTHING? ok. You can get all the crafting lines!
-such a pretty game as I said above. A well put together world 
-quests are not boring like go and kill 20 murlocs. There is always a neat story of why you are doing things, and its never just go kill mobs of X monsters. I spent a while last night just pickpocketing people and running from the law to get into the thieves guild. then I killed some people for the assassins' guild. want to just read books? go to a bookshelf and open one up! 
-LORE. lots of lovely LORE
- mostly free. People that complain about expansions costing money don't know how the world works. You can play this game (besides the actual game cost) for free. there is no real need for paying the month script fees unless you want to get cosmetic items for your or your house. BUT that being said, its a great deal if you want to get levels faster, and you get some crowns thrown in for that sweet sweet flaming dog mount. But, you get a free horse that goes just as fast, so again, you don't have to spend money. 
- you can solo. I am a solo player mostly. I am old and not good at video games, but that's ok. Its not a hard game to play, and most content is solo-able. I will eventually try to join a guild, but I am a filthy casual. dungeon finders work well and I never think I am missing something.

The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,The sewers are full of smelly rat
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"TESO did not come up with anything radically new and actually just dusted off the familiar mechanics of the MMO genre. But it offers them in a greatly improved coat of an otherwise traditional concept and, of course, in the popular world of Tamriel. For some it may be little, for others a sufficient reason to pay monthly fees and have fun.

Jailbreaking and knowing that you have a higher goal is a big cliché in itself. What kind of chosen hero are you when you see dozens of similarly chosen people passing by? In previous The Elder Scrolls games, this model was accepted because it was a singleplayer game. But online with hundreds of thousands of players? And they are all chosen.

Tamriel and his states create the impression of pomp, but later you find out that a large area also suffers from inner emptiness. To some extent, this is due to a graphic concept that lacks the hallmark of originality. The world around is desperately monotonous over time. What bothered me the most was when I came to a town or settlement and found that it looked exactly like the previous one. However, I would expect some specific landmarks or architectural differences - in short, more interesting ideas.

The Elder Scrolls Online is an above-average game, but it expects a great deal of enthusiasm from man for the TES series, world and realities. The better you know Tamriel, the more you will enjoy it. Be sure to try the game, provided you don't normally play much online games or you're a big fan of The Elder Scrolls. I will definitely come back to TESO to see what the updates have done with the game. [b] 70% [/b]"
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Great game which I just came back to after some time off, unfortunately to discover they changed the privacy policy while I was away.

 Change the privacy policy if you want a positive review, and also give me some compensation for this breach of trust (not a refund, actual COMPENSATION for copy and pasting my personal details all over the internet).

The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Loved the ending! Reading other reviews some folks complain about the monthly pass price though, largely senior citizens it seems. I stand with them, the pricing model is unfair. For that I have to leave a harsh but fair thumbs down."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"I keep losing my connection from the servers. If that wasn't bad enough, the launcher frequently becomes convinced that all the game's files have disappeared and need to be downloaded all over again, which can take hours. I'd estimate that a third of the time I've spent playing the Elder Scrolls Online has been downloading it over and over again. While the game is fun when it works properly, it's not worth putting up with all that."
The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"This game is amazing.
World doesn't get old like in other MMORPG's, so questing and exploring is always relevant and rewarding. Endgame is challenging, but it comes without pressure to do it in a haste. Expansions expand the game, but without forcing players out of older zones and content. I'm having the most fun I had in a while. Subscription is optional, and there is so much gameplay freedom.
I wish I had started playing it sooner.

Give it a chance, first levels might be confusing but if you press through them you're gonna fall in love with the ESO journey."

Altxxxxx, HiFi and some others. This one I have to say blows ALL these experiences out of the water - by miles!

Let me see. Today, this Friday night...I have been in a giant show which was excellently done with anime dancers. I climbed about a mile up in the sky with some people and then we dropped down. I have been in some sort of anime/game forest. I have been in a bowling alley which appeared very real, complete with 50s music and disco light :) I have been in a bar with about 20 people and a bar tender busy running around and serving drinks. I have been in an abandoned prison with scary ghosts, traps and all kinds of stuff. We have played games like CTF and we've been in an old Western town where we were the Sherrifs and shot some bad Bandit dudes :)

A lot of fun also with people showing off their insanely creative avatars. I took my headset off later on and realized that I ""experienced"" more things in one single night than a normal person could ever experience in ""real life"" in a night, uh..a week or a month even. This is just frickin' awesome beyond words.

From a technical point of view, the avatars are excellent and VRchat even allows making and importing your own from Unity. Lip sync, eye tracking and all. Some of the best avatars I have ever seen. The entire system seems polished and runs smooth.

VRChat must have hundreds of ""worlds"" including games etc. to choose from since you can browse them for an half an hour and still didn't see them all. This is crazy. Uh, that being said people can also design their own worlds and games and put them in there. Possibilites: Endless. MIND. BLOWN.

And the people are ALL extremely friendly and supportive etc.

VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"Gameplay/review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKusRXHALCc

VR Chat is the best social game which I've played in virtual reality. I've played it for well over an hour and already had lots of fun. The people I've met have been very welcoming and friendly. So far I've only tried two minigames (discs and wild west) and both of them were well designed, bug free and simply fun to play.

I've played a few other social games (e.g. Rec Room, AltSpaceVR) but VR Chat exceeds both those games in my mind. It just seems as if there's a more established community here and overall everything just seems better (e.g. the games)."
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"This is the best application for virtual reality, hands down. I have been a member of VRchat for over two years, and the community is what makes this place so special. Each ""room"" in VRchat is a direct upload of a scene in Unity (software used to create most VR experiences). This makes it very easy for community members to upload new rooms and content. The developers of VRchat are also making the games they have (Capture the Flag, Battle Discs, etc) available in the SDK. This means over the next few months anyone can adapt these games and create new versions of them!

VRchat is a great way to gain exposure to Unity/development...but you can also just have fun and talk to others here. Other social VR apps don't even compare in that feeling of community you get when you log in. Our meetups are on Sundays, but since its public release there have been people logged in continuously. 

Come join our community, and see for yourself what makes this such a special place!"

Though there are videos online that can put your mind set in the right direction taking you someone step by step. But you could always ask staff,devs etc for help even people with avatars already, But keep in mind even if they have avatars they may or may not know hwo to help you. Its still pretty difficult to make one. But what really put this game on the top is its open source anything within the games rules is allowed I say ask the devs what your planning before doing so. The hub consintly being checked on , Also this is a E for everyone game so keep in mind its for kids also. So in the hub you got watch what your saying my first day in the game someone got banned for loads of not okay words to say if you get my drift.

VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"This game could be good, if only:

* Had a moderation team that did not target non G-rated content
* Allow for age-locked rooms, to prevent children from joining and to allow adults to be adults
* Allow for password-protected rooms to play with your friends

The number of times I've seen moderators ban people for next to nothing is likely going to prevent this game from actually becoming successful. It's unfortunate because the formula they have is actually pretty good.

UPDATE: Shortly after the posting of this review, I found myself IP-banned from the game. Cannot even access their website. The VRChat video of the banning also was ""banned"" from their community page. 

TLDR of the video: Someone else's actions resulted in a mass-banning of the entire world. This is not the way to generate a fanbase."

steer clear of this, alternatives like altspacevr exist and are much better"
VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"I am having a VR setup since December and I have seen A LOT, that includes a ton of games, ""experiences"", demos. And also a bunch of social VR apps, incl. Altxxxxx, HiFi and some others. This one I have to say blows ALL these experiences out of the water - by miles!

Let me see. Today, this Friday night...I have been in a giant show which was excellently done with anime dancers. I climbed about a mile up in the sky with some people and then we dropped down. I have been in some sort of anime/game forest. I have been in a bowling alley which appeared very real, complete with 50s music and disco light :) I have been in a bar with about 20 people and a bar tender busy running around and serving drinks. I have been in an abandoned prison with scary ghosts, traps and all kinds of stuff. We have played games like CTF and we've been in an old Western town where we were the Sherrifs and shot some bad Bandit dudes :)

A lot of fun also with people showing off their insanely creative avatars. I took my headset off later on and realized that I ""experienced"" more things in one single night than a normal person could ever experience in ""real life"" in a night, uh..a week or a month even. This is just frickin' awesome beyond words.

From a technical point of view, the avatars are excellent and VRchat even allows making and importing your own from Unity. Lip sync, eye tracking and all. Some of the best avatars I have ever seen. The entire system seems polished and runs smooth.

VRChat must have hundreds of ""worlds"" including games etc. to choose from since you can browse them for an half an hour and still didn't see them all. This is crazy. Uh, that being said people can also design their own worlds and games and put them in there. Possibilites: Endless. MIND. BLOWN.

And the people are ALL extremely friendly and supportive etc.

This is VR as good as it can get with TONS of fun and infinite things to do. Seriously it's mind-blowingly good.

PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Really love this game! Its fun and entertaining... ESPECIALLY when you have a fun outfit who loves to pull jokes and pranks on eachother and enemys alike! 

Tips to new players:
1: Keep calm and respawn.
2: You WILL die ALOT!
3: Practice your aim, it gets better with time/experience.
4: Work Together! Its a TEAM game!
5: No weapon is the same as the other, they each have their own Strength's!
6: Black and gold weapons are EXACTLY the same as their standard variant! They also cost real money.
7: Learn your Keybindings! It Helps Alot!
8: Pick smaller fights untill your used to the game mechanics!
9: If you can see them you can kill them!
10: Be RESPECTFUL!!! If you are, others will be more willing to help you! Dont be afraid to ask for help, EVERYONE needs help!

These are the general tips/tricks/rules I live by! In any game! 
If your on faction VS (vanu) on server Emerald, My name is DrunkenVS
Please, Have a good day and Have fun!


2/18/2017 Edit: Some of my outfit/platoon mates gave me some ideas as to what to put for the 10 things as I could only think of about 4 on my own :P 
So thanks to them to make this review entirely possible!

3/1/2017 Edit 2: a few more tips for you are   
1) dont run infront of your allies that are shooting, go behind them so you stay out of their line of fire.   
2) use the terain around you for cover.  
3) if your a Heavy Assault turn you shield on when entering cover, even if your not being shot at. reason is this is a CLIENT side game if you can see them, you can shoot them. so if your in cover they may still see you out of cover for a short time after because they havent recieved the info from you yet. so use the addage of ""I can see you, I can shoot you"" the same goes for the other players aswell   
4) Don't go straight for the enemy UNLESS you have several teamates with you. Try your BEST to FLANK the enemy. don't attack them head on. come at them from the sides, above, or even behind them, if one tactic dosen't work... Try something else. the fight is dynamic, just like you!  5) Finally, LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of your weapons, it WILL take time.


P.S. Feel free to add my on steam or PS2 (ingame) the name i listed is my primary although if you want i can tell you the others via PM or steam chat.

P.P.S. I added some tips my teamates and friends gave me. some others on Youtube, like Wrel (Dev) Nico101, Joshino, and others have also said some of these tips. If you want to know more about the game look them up on youtube Especially Wrel, as he's a developer. Nico101 I'd recoment to Older audiences, as there is some ""Humor"" that younger audiences may find offensive or dont understand. (he and his team swear a bit aswell) i do squad ops with them and its mostly moments of WTF?! and general fun. Joshino and Wrel are a great choice to see if you want to Learn more about the game, its mechanics and also for general info/guides for weapons or tactics. 

Now all this is simply my PERSONAL opinion, while i agree that some others may not agree with me, i hold my opinions of the game and the players in fair judgment. 

Also, if you have any ideas for tips/tricks/unspoken rules/etc. post them in the comments. I will add them to the list and give you credit. feel free do discuss this game in comments below. Happy Gaming everyone!"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Pros:
  + HUGE open worlds
  + Large servers
  + It's FREE

Cons:
  - Can be hard for new players
  - A little bit of grinding 

      Planetside 2 is an online tactical shooter in which you choose to be a soldier in one of three different factions that are involved in an eternal struggle for various planets. Each faction must capture control points in order to gain control of the planet. There are 6 different soldier classes which allow for large differences in personal gameplay. Give it a try because it is free.

 This game was curated for PC Beta Gaming - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Old review below.

Oh man, Planetside... Where do I even start with you?

Okay, let's start with the noticeable stuff first:
- The abyssmal performance:
The performance has been quite bad since launch. After years of patches, it still hasn't really gotten any better. The one trick they pulled was to label the old ""high"" settings to be the new ""ultra"" settings. I think you can see where this is going...
- The weapons:
A billion iterations of every weapon there is, with little to no differences between the guns themselves. Originally the factions were designed to have strengths and weaknesses. Now there are guns which every faction can use, which have no apparent weakness.
- The lags:
Oh god, the lags. Dying behind corners is pretty normal here. Also, other forms of glitching around, bad pop-in (like literally other players popping in 2 metres in front of you... yes, enemies aswell)

I could list several additional problems this game has, but I'm just tired. There is no hope here,



OLD REVIEW:

The game can be quite frustrating at the beginning until you get the ropes. Then it starts to be incerasingly more fun. I'd recommend getting into an outfit as soon as possible and participate in their squads, it will enhance your experience."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"You thought Battlefield was war. You were wrong. 

This is war. 

Battles with hundreds of people fighting on each side in Combined arms battles with air and land vehicles across maps that are more than 100 square kilometres. Grab your 980ti and hold on tight, because you're in for a treat."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"#Pros and cons#
Epic, unique, one of a kind. It's 2017 and still no game like this one.
A war, vast worlds, playground, massive battles (and also opposite), variety, tactical, outstanding.
A war, free2play but no child's playground.
Well in a chaotic massive battle everyone could find his role and spot......
Teamwork, lone wolf, support, scout, infiltrator, cloaked bugger, jetpack flank warrior, mechwarrior, tank force, air force, gatherer...
Unforgiving, complex and overcomplicated.
Outstanding deep ballistics.

Very very slow progress to unlock this and upgrade that, add these and fully uncap those. 
Grind or die, grind to win, play or pay. 
Anyway time is money. Free2play can turn into the most expensive game by far, by far. No respecs, no refunds.
Brainer. One way or another?
Yea, teamwork, leadership and tactics, that's what matters, 
well you will be facing the most equipped warriors and platoons over n over, also you will be swarmed...,
and well the factions and powers are kinda unbalanced and varied on purpose here and there, 
so you will be facing some OP sh1t over n over. A war.
Well yea mostly everything has a downside. Challenge, outsmart, tactics.
One faction population decrease, the faction can be outnumbered. A swarm. Depending on server, can happen often.
Limited numbers, sometimes queues to one world. At least playing underpopulated faction kinda prevents you from queues. Membership has priority. 

#Honorable mentions#
CPU demanding (average GPU is enough).
Dont expect 120+++ FPS, stable FPS
Beside ingame, you can edit config file for performance, visual clarity, FOV, etc.
Stuck in queue? Just try reenter the queue or ""Join Combat"" button every 1-2mins, should help."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"I think anyone who likes multiplayer FPS games should at the very least try out Planetside 2. This is a very special experience, I can’t think of another FPS that is as ambitious, varied, and outrageous in its dedication to all out chaotic war as this game. Thousands, and I mean thousands of real people at sitting at their computers all across the world battle in this never ending sci fi conflict from a first person perspective, all in glorious real time, and for the most part, it works. It’s astonishing to stare across a field at a giant group of advancing enemy infantry, easily larger than even the largest Battlefield server, snap to iron sights, and fire into the group and score a kill, only to get run over from behind by one of a hundred tanks cresting over the hill, firing in all directions like maniacs. The game is an MMO, but just the very fact that it still manages to feel like a standard FPS with decent controls and shooting mechanics is a grand achievement. Planetside 2 feels, at times, like the perfect game I wanted as a little kid while going “pew pew” with dozens of little plastic army men.

Like other MMOs, you can join an outfit (guild) and fight for one of three distinct factions. The scary red space communists (guns are weak but shoot fast), the freedom loving space Americans (guns are strong but shoot slow), and the spiritual xenophile space hippies (laser guns). These factions are engaged in an eternal conflict over several continents, and the game centers around various control points. Choose a class ranging from the vital medic to the jetpacking Light Assault and help out your team crush the enemy forces. The size of each continent is mind boggling, and while large stretches are usually unused for long periods of time, it is easy to find conflict zones and jump straight in by the game’s intuitive map system. See all of those flashing booms? Shit’s going down there, get in the meat grinder, soldier!

The land and air vehicles are easy to operate, and the infantry controls are familiar if you’ve played any recent FPS. There is a ton of variety in how the gameplay unfolds. One minute you are firing at distant targets in a barren desert from a tank’s turret, the next you could be dropped from a hovering Galaxy troop carrier into the thick of an intense CQB firefight. However, there are definitely long boring stretches of inactivity like in other MMOs, boring car rides or endless sprints to the objective that can become pretty grating over time. Thankfully, you can always kill yourself to respawn somewhere closer, or spawn on a mobile spawn truck known as the Sunderer, so if you’re an impatient type action is never too far away.

The game unfortunately isn’t perfect. Performance is all over the place, despite having a good system expect things to slow down in some of the more hectic combat moments, which is expected since the game is trying to render hundreds of people shooting each other. The F2P system isn’t too bad, the starting guns are definitely viable in combat, but in order to get another weapon or even to unlock a new attachment can feel very grindy at times. Players who spend a ton of money will definitely have an advantage over you in a 1v1 situation since they have access to more gadgets, scopes, etc. than you do, but since the battles are so chaotic and packed with people, this is rarely an issue. 

Planetside 2 is an ambitious game that truly makes you feel like you are a small cog in a giant sci fi battle. I feel as if many multiplayer FPS games are becoming more and more obsessed with making every player feel like a cool guy special forces operator, but Planetside 2 basically says, “You don’t matter, you’re one of hundreds of dumb grunts running around and you are most likely going to die real quick.” I really enjoy this and I wished more developers would work towards making a similar MMOFPS like this of our dreams. Imagine an MMOFPS set in Europe during WW2 (Not that Heroes and Generals shits), now that would be something I really like. Imagine Allied forces landing in player controlled LCVPs, while Axis Luftwafe strafe the beaches, and Panzer divisions massing for a counter attack. Now THAT's my dream video game. 

Planetside 2 is definitely worth trying out, it’s free, so why not?"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"I love this game! I play it on the PS4 a lot more than I should, honestly! It's a great game for those looking for a big open battlefield! 7/10, would play again."

PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Great game with incredable large scale battles, or small 10 on 10 fights for a small outpost. Great weapon diversity and abilities which and unique dynamics to each fight. Would highly recommend everyone to try it for free."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This is one of the most difficult FPS games I've ever played simply because of the sheer number or people who can end up shooting at you because of the smallest mistakes... This game puts the OP in ""Teamwork OP"" because a well oiled outfit that has its tactics down can storm a base and turn the tide of a battle even when outnumbered. This game is not pay 2 win but it WILL require you to grind to acquire the gear you want if you're not interested in investing some money for DB cash. There are many class unlocks that cannot be bought and must be earned. 

At this point of the game (like 4 years running now) there are many vets on both sides with lots of gear/weapons unlocked and it can seem daunting for a new player. However the unlockable weapons tend to be sidegrades rather than an outright upgrade, meaning that the stats of the new weapon won't necessarily be better than the last but it may be better for different circumstances i.e. CQC, or Long/mid range fights. Each weapon excels in its own area.

I Believe there is even an xp bonus for soldiers under BR (Battle Rank) 15 to help you get some quick Cert points. I suggest medic for new players as you can earn a TON of xp without having to kill anyone and medics are SUPER useful in big or small fights."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"It's a decent game if there's a lot of players, but the PC version is dying, over the last week I've been on the U.S. West servers and there's never more than 75 people on, for one whole night there was only 3- 8 players at a time. If you want to play this game and enjoy it try it on a console, I played on PS4 periodically for the last year or 2 and it's always had a much larger player base during that period"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,well
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"I have a few hours logged and it is by far my favorite game.  I may drift away for a bit but I always come back.  This is everything you want in a war game.   You can change a battle by yourself or roll over your enemies in a 40 man platoon.

PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Pretty fun game. It's like Battlefield meets Diablo on a HUGE scale consistent conflict. However, after reaching rank 17, and I moved to areas beyond novice, the Pay2Win aspect showed it's ugly head. It got boring being 2-shot wasted by players with bought weapons- despite laying into them heavy with my weapons and they remain uneffected.

It's a free game and it was fun until I ran into those players over and over again. Something I'll play with my friends, but not on my own."

If your on faction VS (vanu) on server Emerald, My name is DrunkenVS
Please, Have a good day and Have fun!


2/18/2017 Edit: Some of my outfit/platoon mates gave me some ideas as to what to put for the 10 things as I could only think of about 4 on my own :P 
So thanks to them to make this review entirely possible!

3/1/2017 Edit 2: a few more tips for you are   
1) dont run infront of your allies that are shooting, go behind them so you stay out of their line of fire.   
2) use the terain around you for cover.  
3) if your a Heavy Assault turn you shield on when entering cover, even if your not being shot at. reason is this is a CLIENT side game if you can see them, you can shoot them. so if your in cover they may still see you out of cover for a short time after because they havent recieved the info from you yet. so use the addage of ""I can see you, I can shoot you"" the same goes for the other players aswell   
4) Don't go straight for the enemy UNLESS you have several teamates with you. Try your BEST to FLANK the enemy. don't attack them head on. come at them from the sides, above, or even behind them, if one tactic dosen't work... Try something else. the fight is dynamic, just like you!  5) Finally, LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of your weapons, it WILL take time.


P.S. Feel free to add my on steam or PS2 (ingame) the name i listed is my primary although if you want i can tell you the others via PM or steam chat.

P.P.S. I added some tips my teamates and friends gave me. some others on Youtube, like Wrel (Dev) Nico101, Joshino, and others have also said some of these tips. If you want to know more about the game look them up on youtube Especially Wrel, as he's a developer. Nico101 I'd recoment to Older audiences, as there is some ""Humor"" that younger audiences may find offensive or dont understand. (he and his team swear a bit aswell) i do squad ops with them and its mostly moments of WTF?! and general fun. Joshino and Wrel are a great choice to see if you want to Learn more about the game, its mechanics and also for general info/guides for weapons or tactics. 

Now all this is simply my PERSONAL opinion, while i agree that some others may not agree with me, i hold my opinions of the game and the players in fair judgment. 

Also, if you have any ideas for tips/tricks/unspoken rules/etc. post them in the comments. I will add them to the list and give you credit. feel free do discuss this game in comments below. Happy Gaming everyone!"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Pros:
  + HUGE open worlds
  + Large servers
  + It's FREE

Cons:
  - Can be hard for new players
  - A little bit of grinding 

      Planetside 2 is an online tactical shooter in which you choose to be a soldier in one of three different factions that are involved in an eternal struggle for various planets. Each faction must capture control points in order to gain control of the planet. There are 6 different soldier classes which allow for large differences in personal gameplay. Give it a try because it is free.

PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Old review below.

Oh man, Planetside... Where do I even start with you?

Okay, let's start with the noticeable stuff first:
- The abyssmal performance:
The performance has been quite bad since launch. After years of patches, it still hasn't really gotten any better. The one trick they pulled was to label the old ""high"" settings to be the new ""ultra"" settings. I think you can see where this is going...
- The weapons:
A billion iterations of every weapon there is, with little to no differences between the guns themselves. Originally the factions were designed to have strengths and weaknesses. Now there are guns which every faction can use, which have no apparent weakness.
- The lags:
Oh god, the lags. Dying behind corners is pretty normal here. Also, other forms of glitching around, bad pop-in (like literally other players popping in 2 metres in front of you... yes, enemies aswell)

I could list several additional problems this game has, but I'm just tired. There is no hope here,



OLD REVIEW:

The game can be quite frustrating at the beginning until you get the ropes. Then it starts to be incerasingly more fun. I'd recommend getting into an outfit as soon as possible and participate in their squads, it will enhance your experience."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"You thought Battlefield was war. You were wrong. 

This is war. 

Battles with hundreds of people fighting on each side in Combined arms battles with air and land vehicles across maps that are more than 100 square kilometres. Grab your 980ti and hold on tight, because you're in for a treat."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"#Pros and cons#
Epic, unique, one of a kind. It's 2017 and still no game like this one.
A war, vast worlds, playground, massive battles (and also opposite), variety, tactical, outstanding.
A war, free2play but no child's playground.
Well in a chaotic massive battle everyone could find his role and spot......
Teamwork, lone wolf, support, scout, infiltrator, cloaked bugger, jetpack flank warrior, mechwarrior, tank force, air force, gatherer...
Unforgiving, complex and overcomplicated.
Outstanding deep ballistics.

Very very slow progress to unlock this and upgrade that, add these and fully uncap those. 
Grind or die, grind to win, play or pay. 
Anyway time is money. Free2play can turn into the most expensive game by far, by far. No respecs, no refunds.
Brainer. One way or another?
Yea, teamwork, leadership and tactics, that's what matters, 
well you will be facing the most equipped warriors and platoons over n over, also you will be swarmed...,
and well the factions and powers are kinda unbalanced and varied on purpose here and there, 
so you will be facing some OP sh1t over n over. A war.
Well yea mostly everything has a downside. Challenge, outsmart, tactics.
One faction population decrease, the faction can be outnumbered. A swarm. Depending on server, can happen often.
Limited numbers, sometimes queues to one world. At least playing underpopulated faction kinda prevents you from queues. Membership has priority. 

#Honorable mentions#
CPU demanding (average GPU is enough).
Dont expect 120+++ FPS, stable FPS
Beside ingame, you can edit config file for performance, visual clarity, FOV, etc.
Stuck in queue? Just try reenter the queue or ""Join Combat"" button every 1-2mins, should help."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"I think anyone who likes multiplayer FPS games should at the very least try out Planetside 2. This is a very special experience, I can’t think of another FPS that is as ambitious, varied, and outrageous in its dedication to all out chaotic war as this game. Thousands, and I mean thousands of real people at sitting at their computers all across the world battle in this never ending sci fi conflict from a first person perspective, all in glorious real time, and for the most part, it works. It’s astonishing to stare across a field at a giant group of advancing enemy infantry, easily larger than even the largest Battlefield server, snap to iron sights, and fire into the group and score a kill, only to get run over from behind by one of a hundred tanks cresting over the hill, firing in all directions like maniacs. The game is an MMO, but just the very fact that it still manages to feel like a standard FPS with decent controls and shooting mechanics is a grand achievement. Planetside 2 feels, at times, like the perfect game I wanted as a little kid while going “pew pew” with dozens of little plastic army men.

Like other MMOs, you can join an outfit (guild) and fight for one of three distinct factions. The scary red space communists (guns are weak but shoot fast), the freedom loving space Americans (guns are strong but shoot slow), and the spiritual xenophile space hippies (laser guns). These factions are engaged in an eternal conflict over several continents, and the game centers around various control points. Choose a class ranging from the vital medic to the jetpacking Light Assault and help out your team crush the enemy forces. The size of each continent is mind boggling, and while large stretches are usually unused for long periods of time, it is easy to find conflict zones and jump straight in by the game’s intuitive map system. See all of those flashing booms? Shit’s going down there, get in the meat grinder, soldier!

The land and air vehicles are easy to operate, and the infantry controls are familiar if you’ve played any recent FPS. There is a ton of variety in how the gameplay unfolds. One minute you are firing at distant targets in a barren desert from a tank’s turret, the next you could be dropped from a hovering Galaxy troop carrier into the thick of an intense CQB firefight. However, there are definitely long boring stretches of inactivity like in other MMOs, boring car rides or endless sprints to the objective that can become pretty grating over time. Thankfully, you can always kill yourself to respawn somewhere closer, or spawn on a mobile spawn truck known as the Sunderer, so if you’re an impatient type action is never too far away.

The game unfortunately isn’t perfect. Performance is all over the place, despite having a good system expect things to slow down in some of the more hectic combat moments, which is expected since the game is trying to render hundreds of people shooting each other. The F2P system isn’t too bad, the starting guns are definitely viable in combat, but in order to get another weapon or even to unlock a new attachment can feel very grindy at times. Players who spend a ton of money will definitely have an advantage over you in a 1v1 situation since they have access to more gadgets, scopes, etc. than you do, but since the battles are so chaotic and packed with people, this is rarely an issue. 

Planetside 2 is an ambitious game that truly makes you feel like you are a small cog in a giant sci fi battle. I feel as if many multiplayer FPS games are becoming more and more obsessed with making every player feel like a cool guy special forces operator, but Planetside 2 basically says, “You don’t matter, you’re one of hundreds of dumb grunts running around and you are most likely going to die real quick.” I really enjoy this and I wished more developers would work towards making a similar MMOFPS like this of our dreams. Imagine an MMOFPS set in Europe during WW2 (Not that Heroes and Generals shits), now that would be something I really like. Imagine Allied forces landing in player controlled LCVPs, while Axis Luftwafe strafe the beaches, and Panzer divisions massing for a counter attack. Now THAT's my dream video game. 

Planetside 2 is definitely worth trying out, it’s free, so why not?"
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"I love this game! I play it on the PS4 a lot more than I should, honestly! It's a great game for those looking for a big open battlefield! 7/10, would play again."

I'm not wrong though, it's pretty awesome."

PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Best free 2 play game I have ever played, It actually feels like a battle in a war, there can be sooo many players in one place at a time it's really is fun and unique unlike other games and it's also free so no reason why not to get it."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"Great game with incredable large scale battles, or small 10 on 10 fights for a small outpost. Great weapon diversity and abilities which and unique dynamics to each fight. Would highly recommend everyone to try it for free."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This is one of the most difficult FPS games I've ever played simply because of the sheer number or people who can end up shooting at you because of the smallest mistakes... This game puts the OP in ""Teamwork OP"" because a well oiled outfit that has its tactics down can storm a base and turn the tide of a battle even when outnumbered. This game is not pay 2 win but it WILL require you to grind to acquire the gear you want if you're not interested in investing some money for DB cash. There are many class unlocks that cannot be bought and must be earned. 

At this point of the game (like 4 years running now) there are many vets on both sides with lots of gear/weapons unlocked and it can seem daunting for a new player. However the unlockable weapons tend to be sidegrades rather than an outright upgrade, meaning that the stats of the new weapon won't necessarily be better than the last but it may be better for different circumstances i.e. CQC, or Long/mid range fights. Each weapon excels in its own area.

I Believe there is even an xp bonus for soldiers under BR (Battle Rank) 15 to help you get some quick Cert points. I suggest medic for new players as you can earn a TON of xp without having to kill anyone and medics are SUPER useful in big or small fights."
PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"It's a decent game if there's a lot of players, but the PC version is dying, over the last week I've been on the U.S. West servers and there's never more than 75 people on, for one whole night there was only 3- 8 players at a time. If you want to play this game and enjoy it try it on a console, I played on PS4 periodically for the last year or 2 and it's always had a much larger player base during that period"

FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Look, you can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it. It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it. You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really good.

What I *am* going to try to do is let you know about a few things before you buy that I don't see a lot of people telling new players.

First, and maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*
- What does this mean?
If you buy FFXIV from Square Enix directly you can only buy future expansions from them and only them. This means that if steam is having a sale on the expansion you cannot participate in it. The same goes with Steam. If you buy the game on Steam you can only buy future expansions from steam and not Square. This can be frustrating as I've seen people buy their game from the wrong place and waste money. Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.

Second, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different
- What does this mean?
There are two types of subscriptions. 
The first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.
The second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. 
There are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. 

Third, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character
- What does this mean?
Every character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.

Overall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,did you know that FINAL FANTASY XIV™ has a free trial up to level 60 that includes the entire base game as well as the critically acclaimed first expansion Heavensward™ with no time restriction
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"This game presents itself for a large part of the main story as a single player RPG experience; the story is qualitywise comparable to single player Final Fantasy games which – in my opinion – is already an achievement. What really sets aside this game is the love for detail however. I was not expecting a world so full of life, colorful characters and well written plots. Especially the side adventures feature lots of comical elements.

The combat system feels refreshing. You get visual announcements to know what to do and where not stand. Learning by doing is often a welcome approach. You get extra rewards for having someone in your group who has not done the content yet.

The jobs in this game start out with a very basic concept but soon develop into a very well rounded and fun toolkit. The cooldown between the skills may make the battle system look slow at first but you keep unlocking skills that build up on those basic concepts in order to be able to create own solutions and approaches for all types of battles. The jobs differ nicely from each other in terms of core gameplay and positioning. All classes can be played on one character at the switch of a weapon and a crystal. Just to mention a few of many: There are summoners who utilize some of the well known summons of previous games to battle, healers who utilize white healing and protective spells to keep the group healthy or certain gunblade wielding tanks who give you a heavy sense of nostalgia. You will be able to unlock a mount in the form of a Chocobo early on who will also join you as a companion in battle. Different roles (damage dealer, healer or tank) can be taught to your Chocobo as skills. The chocobo is customisable in terms of color and gear (purely cosmetic).

Groups for content can be accessed by a search function or self-created. The size of the group (4 up to 24) depends heavily on the amount of time and effort you would like to invest. Queue times usually are not too long and can easily be bypassed by picking up a small adventure or two on the side. Hard content with different levels of progression is present in this game but not mandatory meaning that if you really want a challenge you will not have a trouble finding it.

There even is an amusement park, Gold Saucer, already known to some of you from playing Final Fantasy VII, which can be accessed to play small adventure games or e. g. Triple Triad (just as glorious as in Final Fantasy VIII) or to hang out with friends. You can purchase an appartment or a house which you can fill with self-created or purchased furnishings. You could even shape the layout to your liking. The location can be picked depending on which country you enjoy the most.

One of the jobs offers access to instruments (for example keyboard, guitar, flute) that can be used to perform. In some of the main cities you can sit down and watch people perform – sometimes even concerts are being held.

Flying is easily acquired in almost every zone by progressing the main story (not early on). Teleporting makes traveling fairly comfortable and easy. Leveling can be done with a variety of questing, dungeons or (non-instanced) world content. With a few weekly challenges you can get secondary jobs up to level swiftly.

The crafting system is a true gem. There is a variety of professions to pick from (e. g. goldsmith and carpenter). They are easy to pick up and items can be crafted with different qualities. A quality craft requires a certain amount of points to be acquired – this can be done by performing different kinds of rotations (you will pick up skills for this – just like in the jobs – while leveling up). There are also gathering professions that will yield you some of the required materials. Monsters can be avoided by a skill learned at early levels to gather efficiently. Later on you can even use your crafting to help rebuild a city.

The graphics are pretty and had – in comparison to a few other more current games – quite a low inpact on my system. With mid range components form years ago I could pretty easily play on high to maxed out settings. The animations are fluid and everything you press in combat feels (and looks) impactful.

Another awesome aspect of this game is the community. It is fairly easy to meet other players who also look for an enjoyable and positive experience. This game features a newbie chat where you can ask questions while playing. Mentors are also part of this chat to help. Becoming a mentor requires quite a bit of work in terms of ingame activies but from what I have seen people treat it as a privilege. Asking for help rarely goes unanswered here at pretty much all times. 

This game can be easily accessed and putting it down for something else was never an issue. Even a small amount of time can provide you with a good experience. I progressed the story in the evenings the last few weeks and was really impressed by how many weekly challenges feel optional instead of mandatory.

A few final words? First of all chapeau for releasing A Realm Reborn and Heavensward as free content (the core game and first expansion). Reading all of the above again this review feels overly positive – so far more than 300 hours in this game have not changed my mind. I wish I would have stumbled earlier upon this gem of a game. The love for detail in pretty much every direction is amazing. Thank you for all the hard work of developing this game over the years.


tl;dr: One of the finest RPGs and even single player experiences out there, even though its an MMORPG. Easily accessible. Creative and unique job and crafting system with depth. More than 200 hours of free content."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Played WoW for 16 years or so. Switched to FF finally been playing past couple days nonstop. Dont regret a single minute of it. Cant wait to start the actual expansions though. Already recommended to all of my friends that play WoW.

FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"okay after over 1000 hours in this game i think i can finally write a review and that should tell you something about the amount of content if i have played for over 1000 hours and only just feel like i can write a review i'll start with the one thing i don't like about this game dungeons.. their just too generic as someone who also plays wow (though not too much right now) they can be tedious but the boss fights are amazingly done and unique but the dungeon layouts and trash are generally the same for every dungeon and even the raids it's just follow the path until you run into a boss theirs not really anything extra to do although while i'm typing this i do recall a dungeon where you have to kill the heads on the plates on the floor (forgot it's name) but that one was a nice change but even still it's the same bland follow the path until you reach the boss. but that's it for the bad from me, everything else is amazing from being able to use every job an a single character to the dev team is amazing fun little fact did you know that the theme for the warrior of light trial fight was written while soken was in hospital battling cancer? and none of the staff knew besides yoshi because he didn't want them to worry or have it lower the standards of his or their work, things like that make me really proud to be a part of this community and want to support the game through good and bad"

FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"World of Warcraft refugee here.

I've been playing World of Warcraft for quite some time, and with quite some time I mean a few darn years. 
I am so used to that game that any other game just seems to dogshiz compared to it. 
Due to Blizzard having such a delay in releasing their content with their latest expansion I've decided to give Final Fantasy XIV Online a try.

Expectations weren't that high, as I am just trying to look for a game I want to play due to WoW boring the living hell out of me.
It entirely surprised me how much content this game has to offer. I don't even know where to get started with this; so let's start with the character creation.

OPTIONS!  So many options, More than WoW I'd say at this point. You can mix and morph stuff you want, colours and haircuts. Facial structures and all types of dazzle wazzle.
I am not much of a weeb myself but I already took a liking to the game from the get-go.

After creating my character and entering the game, and learning that I can play -any- class on this character, makes me have 0 need for an alt; at least. As far as my game knowledge goes, Which is perfect for someone like me.

The Playerbase is SUPER friendly. Me and a buddy dinged lvl 50 and some random guy came over and told us about the game and introduced us to so much stuff, helped explain a lot and answered a lot of questions. Even invited us to a chat for new players where we can ask all our questions.

The combat by far is something I like. Though I am playing on NA servers while I myself am EU, the delay is there. But it is not that noticable. It's rather smooth and enjoyable.

The fact this game doesn't charge you your entire savings to rename or change character appearance is also a massive bonus compared to World of Warcraft.

Unfortunately; due to having the ""The Road to lvl 70"" Buff, we aren't really able to play the game fully, we're mainly just racing through the Main Story Questline, and are by far a few levels ahead of it!

Don't really have to add much other than, 31+ hours in and I am having a -blast-"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"As a long time MMORPG player, I used to judge FF14 by its graphic, see friends plays it, but never convince myself to play it. Until one day i just jumped in and give it a chance. Look at me now, just about a year or so, i maxed out all the classes, got the mentor, cleared savage content, loving the story with the music (one of the best story if not the best in the ff franchise).

If i have to name one bummer, it got to be the pace at the beginning, the combat is slow and fetch quests are tedious. Imagine doing 2.0 quests without flying, ahahaha.....ha, ha, yeah.

That being said, if dinosaurs had access to FFXIV back then they would very much enjoy playing it! As you know, dinosaurs only played the best MMORPGs out there. Since they can't do it anymore, I think it's only fair we do it for them. Or do it for fun, I don't care, I love this game and you should try it out too!"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Chocobos. 14/14
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Overall the game is great.  The fact that you can play with very few restrictions all the way to level 60 is fantastic. It makes it so you really don't have to spend any money on the game to know if you will like it. There are quite a few things unique to this MMO compared to others, so my biggest advice is to come in with an open mind.  There are some quality Youtubers out there that give great insights on different aspects of the game, so if you want to know how specific systems or classes work definitely watch a few of those.

PROS:
-New player and veteran friendly
-World design is so unique and gorgeous from region to region
-The community is friendly and always willing to help new players
-Each class is very unique and feels that way in combat
-Leveling alt classes is fast due to the built in xp boost
-End game is much more accessible than an MMO like WoW due to the shorter required times to run Trials and raids compared to full raids in WoW
-Large XP gained from relatively easy quests makes them feel very worth it

CONS:
-Much of the story is told via text which can make those scenes feel less immersive
-The game takes away your abilities when running lower level dungeons rather than scaling down the effectiveness of the abilities and allowing you to continue using them
-Loot drops much less frequently than in most other MMO games
-Purchasing a story skip without a level boost will likely ruin your early game experience with the game"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"I was 100% heterosexual, with no weeb desires, grown men. And suddenly, a friend of mine said ""Wow sux dude, I know this, you know this, how about you just go and... give a FFXIV a shot. It has a trial version, if you're not gonna like it - just uninstall after some time."" 

60 hours in. Im tanking dungeons with my DRK while listening ""Bury the Light"" for 4 hours straight. Btw, remember this little elf-ish girl in blue n white outfit from MSQ? Alphinaud i guess was her name?.. Where I can find... eugh... ""Hentai"" is the word for this, right?.."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Look, you can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it. It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it. You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really good.

What I *am* going to try to do is let you know about a few things before you buy that I don't see a lot of people telling new players.

First, and maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*
- What does this mean?
If you buy FFXIV from Square Enix directly you can only buy future expansions from them and only them. This means that if steam is having a sale on the expansion you cannot participate in it. The same goes with Steam. If you buy the game on Steam you can only buy future expansions from steam and not Square. This can be frustrating as I've seen people buy their game from the wrong place and waste money. Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.

Second, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different
- What does this mean?
There are two types of subscriptions. 
The first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.
The second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. 
There are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. 

Third, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character
- What does this mean?
Every character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.

Overall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,did you know that FINAL FANTASY XIV™ has a free trial up to level 60 that includes the entire base game as well as the critically acclaimed first expansion Heavensward™ with no time restriction
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"This game presents itself for a large part of the main story as a single player RPG experience; the story is qualitywise comparable to single player Final Fantasy games which – in my opinion – is already an achievement. What really sets aside this game is the love for detail however. I was not expecting a world so full of life, colorful characters and well written plots. Especially the side adventures feature lots of comical elements.

The combat system feels refreshing. You get visual announcements to know what to do and where not stand. Learning by doing is often a welcome approach. You get extra rewards for having someone in your group who has not done the content yet.

The jobs in this game start out with a very basic concept but soon develop into a very well rounded and fun toolkit. The cooldown between the skills may make the battle system look slow at first but you keep unlocking skills that build up on those basic concepts in order to be able to create own solutions and approaches for all types of battles. The jobs differ nicely from each other in terms of core gameplay and positioning. All classes can be played on one character at the switch of a weapon and a crystal. Just to mention a few of many: There are summoners who utilize some of the well known summons of previous games to battle, healers who utilize white healing and protective spells to keep the group healthy or certain gunblade wielding tanks who give you a heavy sense of nostalgia. You will be able to unlock a mount in the form of a Chocobo early on who will also join you as a companion in battle. Different roles (damage dealer, healer or tank) can be taught to your Chocobo as skills. The chocobo is customisable in terms of color and gear (purely cosmetic).

Groups for content can be accessed by a search function or self-created. The size of the group (4 up to 24) depends heavily on the amount of time and effort you would like to invest. Queue times usually are not too long and can easily be bypassed by picking up a small adventure or two on the side. Hard content with different levels of progression is present in this game but not mandatory meaning that if you really want a challenge you will not have a trouble finding it.

There even is an amusement park, Gold Saucer, already known to some of you from playing Final Fantasy VII, which can be accessed to play small adventure games or e. g. Triple Triad (just as glorious as in Final Fantasy VIII) or to hang out with friends. You can purchase an appartment or a house which you can fill with self-created or purchased furnishings. You could even shape the layout to your liking. The location can be picked depending on which country you enjoy the most.

One of the jobs offers access to instruments (for example keyboard, guitar, flute) that can be used to perform. In some of the main cities you can sit down and watch people perform – sometimes even concerts are being held.

Flying is easily acquired in almost every zone by progressing the main story (not early on). Teleporting makes traveling fairly comfortable and easy. Leveling can be done with a variety of questing, dungeons or (non-instanced) world content. With a few weekly challenges you can get secondary jobs up to level swiftly.

The crafting system is a true gem. There is a variety of professions to pick from (e. g. goldsmith and carpenter). They are easy to pick up and items can be crafted with different qualities. A quality craft requires a certain amount of points to be acquired – this can be done by performing different kinds of rotations (you will pick up skills for this – just like in the jobs – while leveling up). There are also gathering professions that will yield you some of the required materials. Monsters can be avoided by a skill learned at early levels to gather efficiently. Later on you can even use your crafting to help rebuild a city.

The graphics are pretty and had – in comparison to a few other more current games – quite a low inpact on my system. With mid range components form years ago I could pretty easily play on high to maxed out settings. The animations are fluid and everything you press in combat feels (and looks) impactful.

Another awesome aspect of this game is the community. It is fairly easy to meet other players who also look for an enjoyable and positive experience. This game features a newbie chat where you can ask questions while playing. Mentors are also part of this chat to help. Becoming a mentor requires quite a bit of work in terms of ingame activies but from what I have seen people treat it as a privilege. Asking for help rarely goes unanswered here at pretty much all times. 

This game can be easily accessed and putting it down for something else was never an issue. Even a small amount of time can provide you with a good experience. I progressed the story in the evenings the last few weeks and was really impressed by how many weekly challenges feel optional instead of mandatory.

A few final words? First of all chapeau for releasing A Realm Reborn and Heavensward as free content (the core game and first expansion). Reading all of the above again this review feels overly positive – so far more than 300 hours in this game have not changed my mind. I wish I would have stumbled earlier upon this gem of a game. The love for detail in pretty much every direction is amazing. Thank you for all the hard work of developing this game over the years.


tl;dr: One of the finest RPGs and even single player experiences out there, even though its an MMORPG. Easily accessible. Creative and unique job and crafting system with depth. More than 200 hours of free content."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,Played WoW for 16 years or so. Switched to FF finally been playing past couple days nonstop. Dont regret a single minute of it. Cant wait to start the actual expansions though. Already recommended to all of my friends that play WoW.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Less to do with the game and more the steam client for it. If you have an old account do NOT purchase anything through steam. Accounts are branded permanently either windows or steam and purchases do NOT cross over/codes cannot be redeemed for the other. You will also NOT be able to login the steam version with a windows account etc and all purchases are NOT refundable for this game on steam.

The game itself is solid but I felt a proper disclaimer should be out there."

FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"World of Warcraft refugee here.

I've been playing World of Warcraft for quite some time, and with quite some time I mean a few darn years. 
I am so used to that game that any other game just seems to dogshiz compared to it. 
Due to Blizzard having such a delay in releasing their content with their latest expansion I've decided to give Final Fantasy XIV Online a try.

Expectations weren't that high, as I am just trying to look for a game I want to play due to WoW boring the living hell out of me.
It entirely surprised me how much content this game has to offer. I don't even know where to get started with this; so let's start with the character creation.

OPTIONS!  So many options, More than WoW I'd say at this point. You can mix and morph stuff you want, colours and haircuts. Facial structures and all types of dazzle wazzle.
I am not much of a weeb myself but I already took a liking to the game from the get-go.

After creating my character and entering the game, and learning that I can play -any- class on this character, makes me have 0 need for an alt; at least. As far as my game knowledge goes, Which is perfect for someone like me.

The Playerbase is SUPER friendly. Me and a buddy dinged lvl 50 and some random guy came over and told us about the game and introduced us to so much stuff, helped explain a lot and answered a lot of questions. Even invited us to a chat for new players where we can ask all our questions.

The combat by far is something I like. Though I am playing on NA servers while I myself am EU, the delay is there. But it is not that noticable. It's rather smooth and enjoyable.

The fact this game doesn't charge you your entire savings to rename or change character appearance is also a massive bonus compared to World of Warcraft.

Unfortunately; due to having the ""The Road to lvl 70"" Buff, we aren't really able to play the game fully, we're mainly just racing through the Main Story Questline, and are by far a few levels ahead of it!

Don't really have to add much other than, 31+ hours in and I am having a -blast-"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"As a long time MMORPG player, I used to judge FF14 by its graphic, see friends plays it, but never convince myself to play it. Until one day i just jumped in and give it a chance. Look at me now, just about a year or so, i maxed out all the classes, got the mentor, cleared savage content, loving the story with the music (one of the best story if not the best in the ff franchise).

If i have to name one bummer, it got to be the pace at the beginning, the combat is slow and fetch quests are tedious. Imagine doing 2.0 quests without flying, ahahaha.....ha, ha, yeah.

Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Let me tell an amazing story about what trove what once was compared to what trove is now.

EDIT3: HERE IS A COUNTUP FOR THE TIME THE DEVELOPERS STILL HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO THIS REVIEW.
https://www.tickcounter.com/countup/22961/time-since-no-developer-reponse-for-my-top-review-on-trove-with-various-complaints

[h1]What was:[/h1]
An amazing sandbox/RPG style game that existed when I was in 8th grade(around 2 years ago). I would log in with one of my best friends and play, level, and build. Classes cost in game currency, so it only took around ~2 months for me of playing an hour a day to obtain every single class. Leveling was not difficult, mounts were not hard to get, and reaching max level was only a matter of time and not that far from people who spent money on this game. Market was somewhat balanced, item mall did not give too many OP items, and it was possible to see people reach max level without spending a single cent. Streamers were nice, loved the game(I was part of a streamer's guild and watched 20+ hours of his stream), and had massive giveaways that simply made every minute of this game fun to play. Grinding was not that annoying since drop rates were not unreasonable, and crafting materials were not so difficult to find or buy from others. When I would happen to get bored(very rarely), it would be a 'why not' to just go ahead and play some soccer from a stadium one of the guild members created. Toxicity and scammers were uncommon, since many people were flourishing and being quite successful both economically and emotionally. I was mastery 60/100 at that time after only about ~150 hours(before steam release obviously).
[h1]After Steam Release:[/h1]
Trove created a ""Patron Pass"", basically a premium subscription based system that when activated, gave double drop rate, double exp, and multiple other benefits. This seemed miniscule at first, since not only was this given out two weeks for free, the buffs do not look that overpowered at first. However, at a deeper glance, trove seemed to slowly lower drop rates for rare items, and people would have to rely on Patron benefits to simply live like the old life of the f2p player BEFORE the steam release. However, this by itself was not bad, since trove gained more populrity, Trion struggeld to keep servers up. Level cap increased to 200. I only pushed myself for another 40-50 hours to make myself readch around level 90/200. Many systems were added to late game characters that seemed to break the economy, as late game players were the ones with 99% of the money. Imagine the game's economy going into a elitist form of economy, that's how it became. Materials became 20x more expensive(Going from 1 flux to 20) and some items were downright impossible to afford. I realized even though I spend more than 150 hours on this game before steam release, I was no poorer than a brand new player who spent 10 hours after steam realease.
[h1]After the ""Cancer Patch"":[/h1]
This. This is the patch that ruined the game. Trion made it so classes could no longer be purchased with in game currency.  Trion claimed that this was to increase the variety among the classes and make people feel more individualized. However, nothing was actually done TO the classes to make them feel more different. In fact, besides a few unnoticable buffs/nerfs, classes remained virtually the same, so Trion failed to communicate that to the people. Although I had every single class(they released a class later that I obviously cannot get without giving them my cash), it seemed like a horrendously stupid move as more people started to actually play this game. 
The classes problem was only the beginning. They added flying mounts later(Dragons). At first this sounds like an amazing idea, as these flying mounts were faster than wings. However, you'd have to do daily quests every day for around a month to obtain one. That system was cancer, since logging in every day to do the same thing just to log out was monotonous and boring, Trion decided to scrap that system too. Since players were actually obtaining these mounts(How horrible right? /s), Trion decided to nerf this system and make a convoluted system where getting these dragons was near impossible and you would literally have to spend x3 the time getting these materials(since they divided the item into a 3 part item that needed to be crafted, hence x3 the time), getting these mounts was a fruitless endeavor.
As stated before, the economy was in ruin, so there was no way to be able to recover without buying items to sell in the item mall, or buying mounts directly that increased your level. I gave up at level 100/300, dirt broke even after grinding in the beta and doing 50 hours of grinding after steam release. Streamers have quit, even the streamer's guild I mentioned before had dissipated(LegendaryStudios). All my friends quit and think of this only as a 'meme game'. After Trion added more and more to the item mall that made this game completely pay2win, this game became a generic f2p that lost all originality that this game once was.  This game had a lot of history with me, and now that simply is just a memory.

Beta:
9/10
Steam Release:
5/10
""Cancer"" Patch:
1/10

EDIT1:I have recently read other reviews and I have noticed a common pattern. Devs seem to ignore and lock threads that have expressed concerns for the huge amount of bugs(since I did not mention these in my original review), huge gameplay downsides, and obvious player distaste for the cancer patch. When the players showed their absolute animosity towards changing a major system in the game(such as the classes costing real money), Trion did NOTHING to calm down the players or change this horrible system.

EDIT2:I never knew this review would actually gain a lot of support from the steam community, so thanks for the support. However, I will say be wary of this review and if it gets taken down, you know what happened."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"My advice.... Save your time and money.

I can't emphasize this enough, yes its ""free to play"" but you WILL end up paying something, if not a lot of your hard earned cash. 90% of the same old bugs from beta are still there, events are recycled to the point everyone just AFK farms them and the actual content updates come around once a year. All that is left is grinding. 

Once you get to U9, where the majority of the people are, you will be plagued by rubber banding, slow chunk loading and constant disconnects. The devs really don't care, the fact they refuse to comment on it and delete or lock threads on the forum where people express their concerns, shows this. They just want new people to play, get hooked and shell out loads of cash before they realize it.

I wish I had been warned before I invested so much time/money into the game. (not through steam)

Trove is a great game at its core, its just run by a greedy, money grabbing company with absolutely no respect for its players/customers."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Awesome game, with great content and even better community.
However it's heavy on bugs/glitches and lacking support on forums. Servers & connectivity are horrible!"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews this past week and just wanted to write my review.  Currently 400+ hours into the game.  It is an amazing break from World of Warcraft as leveling up to about 15ish is very easy going.  Weekly rewards are nice to get, and the in-game community is pretty nice and helpful.  Dailies are nice too as after x amount of times opening Chaos Chest, you are guarenteed a mount/ally/something cool.  You get a lot of free stuff at first - like Mastery Rewards and cheap in-game deals (I would suggest buying the starter pack if you can spare $10).  I was expecting to find a lot of little kids playing this game, but I've actually found more young adults and some older adults too.  

If grinding and patience is not your thing, you will not enjoy this game.  The game does have some lag issues, and I've died a few times to it, but it's not all the time.   Building in this game is a bit different than Minecraft, and if you hate building there are plenty of other things to do.  It's definetly more enjoyable with friends or finding new in-game friends!"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I'm filled with nostalgia when I go back to my very first Trove club, to still see it remain standing strong. Even though it is virtually dead, atleast I can see where we first plotted our spawn point, the musical roads, a good quantity of mazes produced throughout the club's life time and numerous buildings that were once endevours. So many friends I stumbled upon during my activeness in the game. I love building with my Trove buddies more than that actual mining, leveling up, and slaining bosses. Happiness filled my soul because of this marvelous game."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"[h1]Trove of adventures![/h1]
[i]As i'm sure everyone would say after playing this game, where should I begin?[/i]

[b]Graphics:[/b]
If I had to say, I wouldn't say top notch. The graphics is okay, they can bug you. Minecraftish style but not as bad. There is alot more animation's, alot more detail. Do not take this the wrong way. The game hasn't done wrong, it feels right in a blocky sense of way.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Fantastic, that's what I say. The gameplay makes up for alot within the game. You can find alot to do. The recent ingame changes are also very nice. New level caps also I noticed. I know Trove gets some nice updates and some odd ones. Either way you cut the cake, you might still get cherries ontop. What I mean is, the updates normally consists of cons n pros, depending on wether you like cherries or not, some cons to others are pros. 
I honestly can't say how much gameplay there is while describing each one. It is just too much. You'll have to read more about it if you don't already know much. Basic gameplay is both creative and adventure. You will want friends or a club world to help out. You can own your own worlds, house, pets. You can wear any decoration, infact, the loot collector and item hunting is very uniqe making you as a player want to find every piece. Each piece you collect is saved & can be overlayered on set equipment. Base game rewards, item shop, minor NPC support. Alot to keep you going. It is mostly PvE, PvP is a thing too.

[b]SoundFX:[/b]
While being blocky in a block like world, you'd expect the characters of the world to sound different. They have nailed this. Music and sounds are pretty good. I'd have to say it wasn't expected but yes, the game sounds are good. The basic attack or hit sounds however is the same old sound, some soundFX are loopy.

[b]PTW or FTP?:[/b]
This is one of the big concerns when entering a FTP game. Yes, it is FTP. 100%
The great thing about trove is how much they actually have to offer FTP. They don't charge you for club worlds or properties, they don't charge you for alot that they could or other games had or do now. The PTW options are minor but continues to support the servers. As any game, PTW has the options to speed up you're progress towards the game or simply for cosmetic styles. It is simply a choice. Do you enjoy the game? Do you feel it is under valued? Do you feel like the devs did decent work? Questions you ask yourself may lead to you spending a few bucks. But by all means, it is only optional, the choices we're in control to make. The game I'd have to say is FTP.

[u][b]Personnal notes:[/b][/u]
This isn't survival, nor is it up to the standards of graphics these days. It is something I do enjoy playing so I must recommend it. Creativity lovers will really enjoy Trove as most already have. I do suggest playing Trove, espeacially if you don't mind low end graphics with high gameplay value. [u]Be warned,[/u] it is a MMO, it is a RPG. put these two together, you got yourself a cracked egg. The game can be very addictive as any MMORPG.

Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"2k hours and i have to say everything on this game is good but there is some negative things for this game

- super lag game 
- ultra pay to win game ( if you want to go higher mastery rank level you need to buy pack that give you mastery rank xp like 20$ to 50$ to get that pack  there is no free to play on this game if you are rich preson and you don't know where you put your money this game is right place for you. You will be come poor on 2 days)  i have spent like 300$ to this game so may i help devs to fix lag on this game but nothing change. Not only me who spend like that there is some players spend more and more to help devs but nothing change.

i regret play this game , if spend my money to buy new PC better from this S*i*

sorry for my bad English and have good day who ever read this"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,Why did you made it pay to win?
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,Dungeons and dragons in a blocky world
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"This game is great. For anyone that loves to become more and more powerful by leveling up and playing with friends, this is the game for you. For anyone that loves to get endless loot and strive to become one of the most powerful players, this game is for you. But there's a small problem. 

This game is entirely a money run. I don't think I've ever seen a game that is more pay2win than this one. You can literally buy yourself to being some of the most powerful players in the game, despite all those players that choose not to spend any money. Most people who say this game isn't pay2win are people who have spent hundreds of dollars themselves, choosing to deny their own waste of money. For anyone that still thinks this game isn't controllable with money, look at the ""shop"". You can buy all classes, infinite ""gem dust"", and anything else you need to become maxed out. So unless you want to play this game for three years straight while grinding for what seems to be for a fraction of the power the pay2wins have, be my guest and waste your time.


The keyword here, in case you didn't catch it, is: pay2win"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Trove is amazing.........for a while at least. You see, the thrill is present in the beginnings of when you play this game ,but it slowly lessens until you realized that the game is very grindy and boring. The same dungeon, same items, and has a pay2win tone to it and it kinda breaks my heart because of that. The gem update feature makes it feel like the developers want to grab your cash on ""broken gems.""

Maybe if the game gets a HUGE update in gameplay I would rate it better."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"""I legit spent so long on this game.Its pretty good if you want a MMO RPG version of Minecraft."" The game treats its new players way better than its old players. If you want to pay to win then you'll be sure to pass those that have put hundreds of hours into this game. I played this game because i was addicted, the next everyone i knew along with me quit. The game is a cash grab made for those with deep pockets and quick to be pleased with virtual items."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Let us talk about trove: trove is a free to play voxel mmo game that looks smilar to minecraft, this game is really fun to play but the packs are so expensive and the lag is one of the problems that might be a very bad problem when someone invite you to do something with cause you might just miss something , but totally trove is really the best mmo game I have played I think I give it 9/10 maybe ?

It was fun for me to grind hours on end to get practically no where. The farming is not rewarding. The entire game is dependant on RNG and chance. Community is half toxic. Classes were acually pretty great. New players are going to have a hard time starting out due to characters now costing money. Much of it is if you pay you can do MUCH better than others. But then again its not worth paying for this game anyways most the time. I did have some great times in this game but it died off from lack of content and purpose. It did however keep me company for a long time, and i did have fun it it while it lasted."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,I've played for a bit. It's pretty good overall.
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Let me tell an amazing story about what trove what once was compared to what trove is now.

EDIT3: HERE IS A COUNTUP FOR THE TIME THE DEVELOPERS STILL HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO THIS REVIEW.
https://www.tickcounter.com/countup/22961/time-since-no-developer-reponse-for-my-top-review-on-trove-with-various-complaints

[h1]What was:[/h1]
An amazing sandbox/RPG style game that existed when I was in 8th grade(around 2 years ago). I would log in with one of my best friends and play, level, and build. Classes cost in game currency, so it only took around ~2 months for me of playing an hour a day to obtain every single class. Leveling was not difficult, mounts were not hard to get, and reaching max level was only a matter of time and not that far from people who spent money on this game. Market was somewhat balanced, item mall did not give too many OP items, and it was possible to see people reach max level without spending a single cent. Streamers were nice, loved the game(I was part of a streamer's guild and watched 20+ hours of his stream), and had massive giveaways that simply made every minute of this game fun to play. Grinding was not that annoying since drop rates were not unreasonable, and crafting materials were not so difficult to find or buy from others. When I would happen to get bored(very rarely), it would be a 'why not' to just go ahead and play some soccer from a stadium one of the guild members created. Toxicity and scammers were uncommon, since many people were flourishing and being quite successful both economically and emotionally. I was mastery 60/100 at that time after only about ~150 hours(before steam release obviously).
[h1]After Steam Release:[/h1]
Trove created a ""Patron Pass"", basically a premium subscription based system that when activated, gave double drop rate, double exp, and multiple other benefits. This seemed miniscule at first, since not only was this given out two weeks for free, the buffs do not look that overpowered at first. However, at a deeper glance, trove seemed to slowly lower drop rates for rare items, and people would have to rely on Patron benefits to simply live like the old life of the f2p player BEFORE the steam release. However, this by itself was not bad, since trove gained more populrity, Trion struggeld to keep servers up. Level cap increased to 200. I only pushed myself for another 40-50 hours to make myself readch around level 90/200. Many systems were added to late game characters that seemed to break the economy, as late game players were the ones with 99% of the money. Imagine the game's economy going into a elitist form of economy, that's how it became. Materials became 20x more expensive(Going from 1 flux to 20) and some items were downright impossible to afford. I realized even though I spend more than 150 hours on this game before steam release, I was no poorer than a brand new player who spent 10 hours after steam realease.
[h1]After the ""Cancer Patch"":[/h1]
This. This is the patch that ruined the game. Trion made it so classes could no longer be purchased with in game currency.  Trion claimed that this was to increase the variety among the classes and make people feel more individualized. However, nothing was actually done TO the classes to make them feel more different. In fact, besides a few unnoticable buffs/nerfs, classes remained virtually the same, so Trion failed to communicate that to the people. Although I had every single class(they released a class later that I obviously cannot get without giving them my cash), it seemed like a horrendously stupid move as more people started to actually play this game. 
The classes problem was only the beginning. They added flying mounts later(Dragons). At first this sounds like an amazing idea, as these flying mounts were faster than wings. However, you'd have to do daily quests every day for around a month to obtain one. That system was cancer, since logging in every day to do the same thing just to log out was monotonous and boring, Trion decided to scrap that system too. Since players were actually obtaining these mounts(How horrible right? /s), Trion decided to nerf this system and make a convoluted system where getting these dragons was near impossible and you would literally have to spend x3 the time getting these materials(since they divided the item into a 3 part item that needed to be crafted, hence x3 the time), getting these mounts was a fruitless endeavor.
As stated before, the economy was in ruin, so there was no way to be able to recover without buying items to sell in the item mall, or buying mounts directly that increased your level. I gave up at level 100/300, dirt broke even after grinding in the beta and doing 50 hours of grinding after steam release. Streamers have quit, even the streamer's guild I mentioned before had dissipated(LegendaryStudios). All my friends quit and think of this only as a 'meme game'. After Trion added more and more to the item mall that made this game completely pay2win, this game became a generic f2p that lost all originality that this game once was.  This game had a lot of history with me, and now that simply is just a memory.

Beta:
9/10
Steam Release:
5/10
""Cancer"" Patch:
1/10

EDIT1:I have recently read other reviews and I have noticed a common pattern. Devs seem to ignore and lock threads that have expressed concerns for the huge amount of bugs(since I did not mention these in my original review), huge gameplay downsides, and obvious player distaste for the cancer patch. When the players showed their absolute animosity towards changing a major system in the game(such as the classes costing real money), Trion did NOTHING to calm down the players or change this horrible system.

EDIT2:I never knew this review would actually gain a lot of support from the steam community, so thanks for the support. However, I will say be wary of this review and if it gets taken down, you know what happened."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"My advice.... Save your time and money.

I can't emphasize this enough, yes its ""free to play"" but you WILL end up paying something, if not a lot of your hard earned cash. 90% of the same old bugs from beta are still there, events are recycled to the point everyone just AFK farms them and the actual content updates come around once a year. All that is left is grinding. 

Once you get to U9, where the majority of the people are, you will be plagued by rubber banding, slow chunk loading and constant disconnects. The devs really don't care, the fact they refuse to comment on it and delete or lock threads on the forum where people express their concerns, shows this. They just want new people to play, get hooked and shell out loads of cash before they realize it.

I wish I had been warned before I invested so much time/money into the game. (not through steam)

Trove is a great game at its core, its just run by a greedy, money grabbing company with absolutely no respect for its players/customers."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Awesome game, with great content and even better community.
However it's heavy on bugs/glitches and lacking support on forums. Servers & connectivity are horrible!"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews this past week and just wanted to write my review.  Currently 400+ hours into the game.  It is an amazing break from World of Warcraft as leveling up to about 15ish is very easy going.  Weekly rewards are nice to get, and the in-game community is pretty nice and helpful.  Dailies are nice too as after x amount of times opening Chaos Chest, you are guarenteed a mount/ally/something cool.  You get a lot of free stuff at first - like Mastery Rewards and cheap in-game deals (I would suggest buying the starter pack if you can spare $10).  I was expecting to find a lot of little kids playing this game, but I've actually found more young adults and some older adults too.  

If grinding and patience is not your thing, you will not enjoy this game.  The game does have some lag issues, and I've died a few times to it, but it's not all the time.   Building in this game is a bit different than Minecraft, and if you hate building there are plenty of other things to do.  It's definetly more enjoyable with friends or finding new in-game friends!"
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I'm filled with nostalgia when I go back to my very first Trove club, to still see it remain standing strong. Even though it is virtually dead, atleast I can see where we first plotted our spawn point, the musical roads, a good quantity of mazes produced throughout the club's life time and numerous buildings that were once endevours. So many friends I stumbled upon during my activeness in the game. I love building with my Trove buddies more than that actual mining, leveling up, and slaining bosses. Happiness filled my soul because of this marvelous game."
Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"[h1]Trove of adventures![/h1]
[i]As i'm sure everyone would say after playing this game, where should I begin?[/i]

[b]Graphics:[/b]
If I had to say, I wouldn't say top notch. The graphics is okay, they can bug you. Minecraftish style but not as bad. There is alot more animation's, alot more detail. Do not take this the wrong way. The game hasn't done wrong, it feels right in a blocky sense of way.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Fantastic, that's what I say. The gameplay makes up for alot within the game. You can find alot to do. The recent ingame changes are also very nice. New level caps also I noticed. I know Trove gets some nice updates and some odd ones. Either way you cut the cake, you might still get cherries ontop. What I mean is, the updates normally consists of cons n pros, depending on wether you like cherries or not, some cons to others are pros. 
I honestly can't say how much gameplay there is while describing each one. It is just too much. You'll have to read more about it if you don't already know much. Basic gameplay is both creative and adventure. You will want friends or a club world to help out. You can own your own worlds, house, pets. You can wear any decoration, infact, the loot collector and item hunting is very uniqe making you as a player want to find every piece. Each piece you collect is saved & can be overlayered on set equipment. Base game rewards, item shop, minor NPC support. Alot to keep you going. It is mostly PvE, PvP is a thing too.

[b]SoundFX:[/b]
While being blocky in a block like world, you'd expect the characters of the world to sound different. They have nailed this. Music and sounds are pretty good. I'd have to say it wasn't expected but yes, the game sounds are good. The basic attack or hit sounds however is the same old sound, some soundFX are loopy.

[b]PTW or FTP?:[/b]
This is one of the big concerns when entering a FTP game. Yes, it is FTP. 100%
The great thing about trove is how much they actually have to offer FTP. They don't charge you for club worlds or properties, they don't charge you for alot that they could or other games had or do now. The PTW options are minor but continues to support the servers. As any game, PTW has the options to speed up you're progress towards the game or simply for cosmetic styles. It is simply a choice. Do you enjoy the game? Do you feel it is under valued?

Wild Shadow did everything perfect with this game.  Then Kabam bought them out and turned it into more of a pay to win.  Kabam did some good, but mostly bad.  They owned Realm for a long time, but very recently a company called DECA bought it from Kabam.  DECA has been incredible in my opinion.  They have released more updates in two months than Kabam did in 5 years.  New things and skins and map changes, it's exactly whatneeded to happen.  So, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it right now.  About 6 months ago I would've said not to bother.  I just hope DECA keeps with it"

Realm of the Mad God Exalt,Massively%20Multiplayer,200210,"Man where do I even start with this game.. I started like 12867 years ago when it came out on Kongregate and it was awesome! Wild Shadow did everything perfect with this game.  Then Kabam bought them out and turned it into more of a pay to win.  Kabam did some good, but mostly bad.  They owned Realm for a long time, but very recently a company called DECA bought it from Kabam.  DECA has been incredible in my opinion.  They have released more updates in two months than Kabam did in 5 years.  New things and skins and map changes, it's exactly whatneeded to happen.  So, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it right now.  About 6 months ago I would've said not to bother.  I just hope DECA keeps with it"
Realm of the Mad God Exalt,Massively%20Multiplayer,200210,"[h1]Even though this game is simple and decent fun, it's pretty dull and repetitive once you play it for a while.

There are micro-transactions of some level, which is pretty much inevitable in today's free to play titles.

At least it's free, and you can play it a fairly decent amount without investing any money in it."

I don't know if I would recomment this game to any of my friends,

Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,This game announced at 2013. Now I'm fat and bald but thank god finally able to play this masterpiece.
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"I've been in a gaming slump for a while, and this has absolutely got my interest.

Diablo style combat in an MMO with all the collecting etc. 

I've logged a... large amount of hours in Diablo 3. The combat in that is smooth, and Lost Ark feels similar in that the combat just feels great. The controls are a little different, but after a couple of hours it was absolutely fine.

I've only experienced a few hours, but I can tell that this is a game I can finally look forward to and spend time with due to the activities on offer.

Refunded so I can get a higher founder tier."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,K-pop Diablo with better multiplayer and endgame.
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Don't listen to anyone telling you this game is p2w, they have no clue what they're talking about.

Lost Ark Online an incredibly polished MMORPG, filled to the brim with content. 
Every single class feels extremely unique and fun to play. You've got several ways to play a class, you can reset your skill points for free at any time to adjust your build to the content too.
No holy trinity here, so don't be afraid of needing to play a specific class to feel wanted in endgame content. 

The world is huge, HUGE.
You start the game on one continent, then once you're done with the very cool story with superb cutscenes, of which the quality only get better through the story, you get to sail on a ship and can choose to do sea activities or go to other continents to continue the main sceario quest or all the islands out there to find things like collectibles, extra skill points...
The leveling experience is a wonderful ride. The dungeons are fun, and quite a few are straight up SPECTACULAR. 

It's graphically one of the most impressive MMORPGs out there. It looks BEAUTIFUL, almost every area is just so pleasing in its own way. From fae lands, to wuxia towns, to literally Midgar from Final Fantasy 7, there's a huge amount of diversity in aesthetics between the continents and it's great.

I just love this game a lot overall. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"got to level 60 on the Korean Ver, and i only speak and read English, this just tells you how good this game really is, This game takes Diablo 3 to a whole new level, the Combat in this game is Next level, The spells and Skills you use in this game feel Great, you can feel the power behind every spell or swing of your sword, 

Diablo 4 should be scared of this game."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Holy shit please just release it, after playing the alpha im addicted"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Let's start by opening with: it isn't P2W - for those that have played in other versions (myself included) monetisation is not something to be concerned about.

With perfectly equalised and balanced arena PvP, and even a number of equalised raids as well (with rank boards for clears), this is a great game for both competitive PvPers and PvErs alike.

There are viable progression paths for all sorts of people, be they casual or hardcore, F2P or whale, or any combination.

The game is incredibly fun and will definitely scratch the itch that many of us have been having for a proper, high-quality AAA MMORPG - I've been enjoying this casually in other regions and plan to make it my main game once its out in the West, because it definitely has the appeal to keep me hooked long-term.

...

Now, if you're interested in a little history:

MMORPGs have not been doing too hot lately - from the golden age of the early 2010s where a new big MMO was coming to ""dethrone WoW"" every other week, the genre has been starved as MOBAs and Battle Royales took the mainstream spot.

With limited releases and an aging genre, there just isn't much of anything fresh coming along - expansions for other, older MMOs can seem more appealing than betting on new indie releases.

With this context, Lost Ark comes at the greatest possible time. Teased way back in GSTAR 2014 - when our MMO fever was at its peak - this strange yet uniquely appealing Diablo-esque looking MMO was hyped beyond belief.

Being in development hell for years, it wasn't until December 2018 (almost 2019) that it saw its full release in Korea. With a rocky journey, it faced multiple revamps and region releases, trying to find its own identity.

Yet now, it has been the most played MMORPG in Korea for months on end (according to http://gametrics.com/) - and it is in this polished state that we are getting Lost Ark in the West.

And gosh, polished it is! 

Classes are varied with unique identities (both figuratively and literally, given the identity system), there is all sorts of content - from competitive PvP and raiding to exploration and lifeskilling - as well as incredibly entertaining dungeons and core system mechanics.

The developers have been on a warpath to deliver new content, releasing multiple endgame raids in short periods of time and constantly adjusting balancing to fine tune class performance. The game is most definitely loved, not just by players, but by its own developers.

It doesn't stop at the gameplay either. A beautiful score and incredible graphics, you can lose yourself in playing the multiple dungeons and raids. Whether doing little island sidequests or experiencing the cutscenes in the main questline, there is a real sense of awe as you go through the content this game has to offer.

It is an MMORPG - you'll do the old school running through quests, levelling up, grouping up with people for raids and gearing up your characters. Sometimes though, that's exactly the experience you want. Lost Ark Online provides just that, but with polish.

I have been playing this game casually for the past 2 years - now that it is coming to the West I plan to make this my main game with no hesitation.

Great game, probably one of the best MMOs out there and - as a matter of fact (according to ratings) - the best KRMMO out there currently."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn't want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.

The dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.

People who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won't replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don't use the boxes.

PvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules ""No healing potions, no ultimates"" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it's my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can't do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I'll leave it as ""I'm new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being"".

Addressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don't feel it's a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That's pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don't have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it's not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.

Classes. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won't be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren't available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I'm not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn't' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.

So to wrap it up, as someone who went in with 0 expectation, and 0 knowledge of the game, I really enjoyed it. I think the market is in serious need of a new MMO format, and this is a game I will gamble on."

"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Really enjoyed this Alpha! I was legit sad when I saw that the alpha ended last night as I had a blast trying out some of the classes. My faves so far are the shadowhunter, bard and soulfist. The only thing that I could see being an improvement would be to make sure that the subtitles match what the voice actors say as it was similar but not quite the same. Also the client took a long time to load up but hopefully with beta/release it will be better optimized."

It's a game where your first few skills look cooler and have more substance than every skill in other isometric ARPGs combined.

If you're a fan of the genre, even if you're not big on the MMO aspect, I highly recommend trying this. The combat alone could be enough to sell you on this free game."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"The game is in a storytelling marvel, and offers so much content that you could fill an entire day with Lost Ark alone and still have plenty left over to do. While we are in Alpha testing I will hold off on making any comments as a final review - but, in the interim I will say I have been enjoying the game so, so much. While Amazon Games has stumbled in the past with past titles, I feel they will do a good job publishing the title for a western audience. Cheers to the staff who have worked around the clock, and cheers to the community who has waited tirelessly since they heard about the game for it's arrival to the west. We made it, lads. ♥"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,I have played 300+ hours on the Russian version solo. But now forgot about it I am going to no life the shit out of this game cause of how fun and addicting it was. Trust me give it a try you won't be disappointed.  10/10 worth

Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"I've been in a gaming slump for a while, and this has absolutely got my interest.

Diablo style combat in an MMO with all the collecting etc. 

I've logged a... large amount of hours in Diablo 3. The combat in that is smooth, and Lost Ark feels similar in that the combat just feels great. The controls are a little different, but after a couple of hours it was absolutely fine.

I've only experienced a few hours, but I can tell that this is a game I can finally look forward to and spend time with due to the activities on offer.

Refunded so I can get a higher founder tier."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Holy shit please just release it, after playing the alpha im addicted"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,K-pop Diablo with better multiplayer and endgame.
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Don't listen to anyone telling you this game is p2w, they have no clue what they're talking about.

Lost Ark Online an incredibly polished MMORPG, filled to the brim with content. 
Every single class feels extremely unique and fun to play. You've got several ways to play a class, you can reset your skill points for free at any time to adjust your build to the content too.
No holy trinity here, so don't be afraid of needing to play a specific class to feel wanted in endgame content. 

The world is huge, HUGE.
You start the game on one continent, then once you're done with the very cool story with superb cutscenes, of which the quality only get better through the story, you get to sail on a ship and can choose to do sea activities or go to other continents to continue the main sceario quest or all the islands out there to find things like collectibles, extra skill points...
The leveling experience is a wonderful ride. The dungeons are fun, and quite a few are straight up SPECTACULAR. 

It's graphically one of the most impressive MMORPGs out there. It looks BEAUTIFUL, almost every area is just so pleasing in its own way. From fae lands, to wuxia towns, to literally Midgar from Final Fantasy 7, there's a huge amount of diversity in aesthetics between the continents and it's great.

I just love this game a lot overall. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"got to level 60 on the Korean Ver, and i only speak and read English, this just tells you how good this game really is, This game takes Diablo 3 to a whole new level, the Combat in this game is Next level, The spells and Skills you use in this game feel Great, you can feel the power behind every spell or swing of your sword, 

Diablo 4 should be scared of this game."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Let's start by opening with: it isn't P2W - for those that have played in other versions (myself included) monetisation is not something to be concerned about.

With perfectly equalised and balanced arena PvP, and even a number of equalised raids as well (with rank boards for clears), this is a great game for both competitive PvPers and PvErs alike.

There are viable progression paths for all sorts of people, be they casual or hardcore, F2P or whale, or any combination.

The game is incredibly fun and will definitely scratch the itch that many of us have been having for a proper, high-quality AAA MMORPG - I've been enjoying this casually in other regions and plan to make it my main game once its out in the West, because it definitely has the appeal to keep me hooked long-term.

...

Now, if you're interested in a little history:

MMORPGs have not been doing too hot lately - from the golden age of the early 2010s where a new big MMO was coming to ""dethrone WoW"" every other week, the genre has been starved as MOBAs and Battle Royales took the mainstream spot.

With limited releases and an aging genre, there just isn't much of anything fresh coming along - expansions for other, older MMOs can seem more appealing than betting on new indie releases.

With this context, Lost Ark comes at the greatest possible time. Teased way back in GSTAR 2014 - when our MMO fever was at its peak - this strange yet uniquely appealing Diablo-esque looking MMO was hyped beyond belief.

Being in development hell for years, it wasn't until December 2018 (almost 2019) that it saw its full release in Korea. With a rocky journey, it faced multiple revamps and region releases, trying to find its own identity.

Yet now, it has been the most played MMORPG in Korea for months on end (according to http://gametrics.com/) - and it is in this polished state that we are getting Lost Ark in the West.

And gosh, polished it is! 

Classes are varied with unique identities (both figuratively and literally, given the identity system), there is all sorts of content - from competitive PvP and raiding to exploration and lifeskilling - as well as incredibly entertaining dungeons and core system mechanics.

The developers have been on a warpath to deliver new content, releasing multiple endgame raids in short periods of time and constantly adjusting balancing to fine tune class performance. The game is most definitely loved, not just by players, but by its own developers.

It doesn't stop at the gameplay either. A beautiful score and incredible graphics, you can lose yourself in playing the multiple dungeons and raids. Whether doing little island sidequests or experiencing the cutscenes in the main questline, there is a real sense of awe as you go through the content this game has to offer.

It is an MMORPG - you'll do the old school running through quests, levelling up, grouping up with people for raids and gearing up your characters. Sometimes though, that's exactly the experience you want. Lost Ark Online provides just that, but with polish.

I have been playing this game casually for the past 2 years - now that it is coming to the West I plan to make this my main game with no hesitation.

Great game, probably one of the best MMOs out there and - as a matter of fact (according to ratings) - the best KRMMO out there currently."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn't want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.

The dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.

People who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won't replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don't use the boxes.

PvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules ""No healing potions, no ultimates"" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it's my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can't do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I'll leave it as ""I'm new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being"".

Addressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don't feel it's a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That's pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don't have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it's not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.

Classes. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won't be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren't available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I'm not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn't' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.

So to wrap it up, as someone who went in with 0 expectation, and 0 knowledge of the game, I really enjoyed it. I think the market is in serious need of a new MMO format, and this is a game I will gamble on."

"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Really enjoyed this Alpha! I was legit sad when I saw that the alpha ended last night as I had a blast trying out some of the classes. My faves so far are the shadowhunter, bard and soulfist. The only thing that I could see being an improvement would be to make sure that the subtitles match what the voice actors say as it was similar but not quite the same. Also the client took a long time to load up but hopefully with beta/release it will be better optimized."

Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"I've played for 100 hours on RU server. Simply it's the best hack & slash game I've played in my life. Can't wait to dive into Lost Ark world fully legal and play without fear about ban. Give this game a try. Deep progression system, HUGE world, water content which could be the separate game :D PvE, PvP - play what you like and enjoy great battle system :)"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,i bought some korean guys ssn and a vpn to play it in KR and its worth it
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"I thought it was an ARPG because I love the genre, but nope it's a MMORPG and it's one of the best I tried.
You should give it a try, for real!"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Played this game on the russian servers, absolute banger, lets hope Amazon keeps it good."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Lost Ark fulfills a hole left barren by so many developers, and I'm not talking about my ass. 

It's a game where your first few skills look cooler and have more substance than every skill in other isometric ARPGs combined.

If you're a fan of the genre, even if you're not big on the MMO aspect, I highly recommend trying this. The combat alone could be enough to sell you on this free game."
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"The game is in a storytelling marvel, and offers so much content that you could fill an entire day with Lost Ark alone and still have plenty left over to do. While we are in Alpha testing I will hold off on making any comments as a final review - but, in the interim I will say I have been enjoying the game so, so much. While Amazon Games has stumbled in the past with past titles, I feel they will do a good job publishing the title for a western audience. Cheers to the staff who have worked around the clock, and cheers to the community who has waited tirelessly since they heard about the game for it's arrival to the west. We made it, lads. ♥"
Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,I have played 300+ hours on the Russian version solo. But now forgot about it I am going to no life the shit out of this game cause of how fun and addicting it was. Trust me give it a try you won't be disappointed.  10/10 worth

CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,"This review is based on my personal experience with the game.

If you only want a decent drifting platform, the devs got a good one.

They also only censored swear words and other terms like 'fart' but all racial slurs and hate speech terms are uncensored and (including gta 5) this is the most toxic online community I have ever come across.  Most nights has about 400 active gamers online between servers and the open chat.  I had over 93 on block for telling anyone who wasn't a white heterosexual to kill themselves every single time I was in there, which I was on every night but two days in over a 3 week span. I was telling my friend about it and he told me his son had to stop playing the game because of suicidal thoughts from the chat on it, because he is gay. 

I reached out to the devs, like others have, about this and they just ignore or mute you. I have nothing go on why they don't care about any of that, but after beating the game in 3 days, and finding it quite boring beyond the 20 tracks or so they give you (including a reverse run for each track, talk about lazy mappers, but whatever, mods can help that out I guess).

They did three updates I think since I played the game. They have actually ruined the 5 cars I enjoyed using so there's legitimately nothing here for me, now.

I just wanted to come on here and warn all about how toxic and hateful this particular niche community is.  

And to think I was so excited about Car X Street, but I won't be going near this studio after seeing their fans. It even brought up a very important discussion for the studio I'm currently a writer for, and how we're going to implement reprimands for people attempting to send hate speech that will block communications every time for a time limit when they attempt, not even letting it through.  It's not hard to do.  It just takes effort and 'want' and I can't see any proof these Devs want anything but more toxicity. 

'happy' drifting.

If you have any mental health concerns, or the person you're gifting this to has them...  Don't.

You could very well be doing them a disservice"
CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,"pros: its a decent game to mindlessly slide around, it has a fair bit of vehicles to modify, the handling is alright and its easy to get into, 

cons: the scoring system seems to lean alot towards insane angles and speed more than precision driving and smooth transitions and lines, the engine sounds are very bland, the global chat is like a call of duty voice chat lobby and there seem to be alot of very angry and or just vulgar people spamming there at every hours of the day,

all and all it kinda feels like a half baked game, but i wouldnt recommend it mainly for the reason that it gets stale fairly quick and if ur hoping to just relax and slide around and maybe chat to people in there u are going to have wade thru alot of very angry and immature people"

STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,Massively%20Multiplayer,1286830,"Well right now I'm just playing the Jedi Knight story line.  But the story telling seems to be solid.  Like that you can go as deep as you want into various activities or not.  It's awesome that there's no addon reliance but they addressed quality of life stuff so that the usual grind for gear is not as bad.  Standard high level gear drops will be good enough unless you are really wanting to do 8 or 16 man groups and the hardest modes of each then you will need to chase the monkey some but if find a guild that's active in those areas it's not too bad. But it's the Star Wars universe yes it's 3000 years before the movies but you are walking/running thru the same places  as your movie characters just at a different time.  Lots of story telling, lots of content, lots of exploration. Very much an MMO that can keep you occupied for some time.  The lack of social / guild finding in game is sort of sad I mean you literally have to go old school and go into forums of different sites and looks for posts from guilds looking for players.  There are general chat posts of guilds looking but from a quality of life perspective it could be better.  You can have your own stronghold, guild stronghold, guild ship stronghold, multiple properties and such so lots to do there.  Haven't touched crafting but seems to be a credit sink except for those folks that began from the beginning.  The economy is a little wonky for the prices not sure why that is but you get plenty of drops to sell and such.  Companions and pets are here also.  So it's like most MMO's in general but again I say ""OMG it's Star Wars!!!!"" that makes it worth it right there.  They have truly made an MMO that allows a player to decide how deep or what type of experience do you want and it's not tied to the great rat race of chasing raids to get gear.  If you want to do the hardest stuff then you will go down that path but most of the game does not require that kind of requirement. I've played WoW , ESO , Neverwinter and several others they all have their place.  SWTOR seems to have found several avenues for fans of Star Wars to enjoy their adventure at their pace.

The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"It's been years since I purchased this game, and I've played for too long to be deemed healthy by health professionals. Seeing where this game started, and where it is now, I can only say:

I am Disappointed. 

I joined when you could play exclusively in a progressive tree (Small dinosaurs for x amount of times leads to the next tier of dinosaurs) to produce an ecology of sorts. They added AI, more rivers and lakes and removed progression. This, with the idea of promoting a sort of self sustained ecology, backfired. Discords promote pay to grow (discord points through donating to help keep servers running for example), means there are servers that are 95%+ carnivores, and of those, are likely spinos/gigas/rexes. They can survive exclusively on the added AI (this was not possible when it first started), and if they die, they can come back as full grown top tier carnivores within minutes. There is no ecology. 

Combat went from hiding in bushes, to abusing broken hit-boxes, or crossing fingers that lag was working for you and not against you. Imagine playing Darksouls but your dagger has the range of a claymore at 2x size. 

Today? They have legacy (Beta) and Evrima (Beta Beta). Legacy is broken hitboxes and laggy, Evrima is testing a new combat system. Great. There is no effort to making a standing ecology however. both versions have rubber banding issues, and playing a single player is difficult and have GREATLY reduced odds if having to survive against clans/groups of friends. The removal of global chat in official servers have reduced the amount of -toxic- chat in game, but have successfully pushed people to using 3rd party programs with reduced capability of warning other players of misbehavior in servers. 

Promises. Promises. So many things promoted to publix that haven't seen light in years. ""Hypo"" Dinosaurs were seen briefly before being revoked from public access. Only devs could use them, and then devs stopped visiting server to show, no, -flaunt- this exclusive feature until the lack of existance. Humans being added? No. Cannibals being added? No. Vicious environments? No (Except for crippling fall damage from cliffs and drowning) Number of dinosaurs available for public use? Reduced. Number of customizable skins? Reduced (Earthy/muted Color palettes in Legacy have shown promise, but there is only 1 skin available and no color changing in Evirma currently)

I feel in the years that have passed by, that the isle has shown very very poor improvement, and I don't expect this game to be better for -several years- at the rate and history that it has shown. 

There was improvement for the first year. After that, it's been a heart break to watch this beast slowly decay and become ruined. The community is divided between people who hate the game and people who can only hope for the best. These two side will viciously attack the other in defense of their opinion. A quick youtube search or a visit to the isle reddit can give you any little bit of research to decide your fate on clicking 'Buy"".

I post this review as a warning. It's fun for a little bit, but for a long term game, set your expectations low. I'll watch updates, but highly not recommend people playing due to slow development, lacking features, and toxic community."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"The first thing to know about The Isle in 2021 is the two separate versions: Legacy and Evirma.

 Legacy is the ""default"" version of the game, and the version most people play. It has lots of dinosaur species and a very active playerbase, AI dinosaurs for carnivores to hunt down, massive well detailed maps dotted with human landmarks, rivers, lakes, mountains, jungles, grasslands and beaches, and two main gamemodes: survival and sandbox. In sandbox, every non-exclusive dinosaur in the game is playable. You start as an adult and basically do whatever you want. This can range from Death Matches to Dino Chatting Rooms. In survival, less species are available but the gameplay is more dynamic. You start as a baby dino, either a juvenile on your own or a hatchling with a mother. As you feed, hunt and survive, you grow in size and strength, becoming faster and more formidable until you become a fully grown adult. It is often necessary to form groups with members of your own species to better the chances of surviving. If you are a female dino, you can have your own young when you become adult (The nesting system allows other players to teleport to you as hatchling dinos, but they are completely dependent on you until they become juveniles.)

So that's what Legacy has to offer. But whats the catch?

Legacy is the abandoned version of The Isle, no longer receiving updates from the devs. As such, it has lots of bugs, ranging from minor annoyances to game breaking glitches such as oversized hitboxes, rubberbanding, FPS drops, disconnections and more. There are also a few ""tricks"" that undermine the basic values of the game, such as tail riding. It can be more than infuriating when you lose your dino to something only describable as bad game design. Food spawns are also fickle. Certain regions of the maps lack AI for carnivores or bushes for herbivores. As such, many players tend to gather around hot spots rather than explore the maps. There are also toxic players who partake in frowned upon behavior such as ""carebearing"" or taking care of dinos that arent your own species, or ""KOSing"" or killing everything in sight for fun.

Now what about Evirma?

Evirma is an entirely new version of The Isle, a complete recode that was started after the Legacy code became too troublesome and frustrating for the dev team to work with. It has a lot of the features that Legacy had with more yet to come, in addition to many exciting new features including an entirely new map, new dinosaurs, reworks of old dinosaurs, new mechanics such as grazing for herbivores, grabbing dragging and swallowing kills for carnivores, new playstyles for unique creatures like pteranodon and deinosuchus, and new systems for food, perks and elder dinosaurs. Everything in Evirma is much more fluent and natural than Legacy, from movement to combat to the ecology of every distinct species. 

The catch?

Evirma is somewhat bare bones as of now, possessing a far smaller dino roster than Legacy. some features like the diet and elder systems have yet to be added, and as usual there are bugs. However, there have been regular patches and bug fixes from the devs, with a roadmap for future large scale updates already planned out.

Overall, The Isle is a very unique take on the survival genre, and a delight for fans of dinosaurs and paleontology. Progress has been slow but steady, and the game already has a lot of promise with its dynamic gameplay. If you love survival games and dinosaurs, this ones for you. If you're more a fan of fast paced games, maybe pass on this one (Growth takes a while :D.)"
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"After 1325 Hours of this game I think I can give a decent Review...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEGACY IS DEAD - Not being updated at all and has hardly any player base at least for Australia.

Erivma is Alive - BUT is a toxic pool of Mixpacking Chinese hackers that will find you and hunt you down eventually due to ESP hacks. (They also love to sh!t talk in broken English while they kill you)

If you don't die to these people, you're most likely gonna die to people that just kill for sport, so in the long run its just a waste of time, no objective.. just mindlessly killing and eating.

Yes the official servers ""Have No Rules""  BUT that doesn't mean you should be hacking OR ruining the game for others by just making a MEGA PACK of 5 Stegos 5 Crocs and 8 Carnos to run and kill everyone on the Server..

Honestly at the end of the day I do love this game and have met many good friends, maybe I'll reinstall it some day when they fix these issues, but atm its unplayable for me."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I've played that game for quite a while now and I have to admit it's not for everyone.
it does have a lot of bugs but is still a loveable game.
once you know how to play and use specific dinosaurs it will bring a lot of fun.
at the beginning it will be frustrating but when you find the right people to play with it's going to be a lot of fun^^
may I wish you a happy hunt^^"
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,dino born- dino eat- dino die
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"One of the hardest ""Not recommended""s I've ever had to write up. On one hand, the game is unique, tense and fun. But on the other, it is a complete f**king headache to even bother playing or to work up the want to play it. 

In the base game, whatever stupid name you wanna give it. You have to contend with rules, admins and children the likes of which not seen since modern GMod, let alone the whining, crying and other annoying vitriol one puts up with. On top of that, the devs cannot handle criticism and throw bitch fits if someone has a differing opinion than them.

As for EVRIMA or the ""It'll work this time guys"" version:
Imagine spending hours, LITERAL HOURS trying to grow up or find other people so you can chat to someone finally or go for a drink/do something that isn't just wandering aimlessly with nothing in sight but the occasional fish. Now, you finally find others, members of your own species no less, you should be glad right? Wrong, it doesn't matter if you're utahraptor, deinosuchus, even a fucking pteradon. You will be attacked and cannibalized by your own species. Why? Because players are assholes and they've nothing better to do because EVRIMA is empty, and boring. 

TLDR: Great game but expect a lot of wasted time, headaches and dealing with shitters who kill you solely because they can and they were on the server for HOURS before you, meaning they had a day to waste getting big and ready to grief new spawns."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,Haha funny dinosaur game go brrrrr
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I do not recommend this game yet, it has so many bugs, almost as many as cyberpunk 2077, the development is super slow, and it's not worth your money right now, maybe in a year or so, cuz they update the game like every two months, and it's not even big updates."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,If a game can be a scam this is it.  The devs are incompetent and never produce updates on time or even the things they promised in the multiple road maps. Instead of improving the game they constantly break it with 'bug fixes' every time something new is introduced. This is the only game I have ever seen actually go BACKWARDS in development and become WORSE than it was before. Save you and your friends money and just get Beasts of Bermuda or Path of Titans.
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I have 10.8 hours in the game. This was right before envirma was a thing. The game was about a 5/10 at best in *legacy* mode. it was time consuming, empty, and rather boring. I LOVE dinosaurs and this game had a very good down to earth approach to them. There was no objective and most players resorted to creating their own ways to play. now flash forward a few days and envirma comes out. the game is now a 2/10 at best. When envirma launched it took out EVERYthing they worked on and players came to enjoy. It was laggy, unplayable, crashed all the time. and even less things to do and less dinos to play. The art and sound direction are the 2 points this game gets. they have spent so much time and money and resources recreating the game that im sure they will cease production in the coming years.

I got a good 8 hours out of regular of what you could call*fun* 
2 hours into envirma i could realize the ball was dropped and i never picked it up again.

Save your money until the devs put out some real ginormous fixes/changes/improvments.
I really wanted to like the game, but sadly it just wasn't good."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,miarrr
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I can play as a Dinosaur? Awesome. And it is, at first. If you can get used to the bugged controls, the wonky hit boxes, atrocious lag and server admins that only seem to care if something directly affects their game.

The links to the discords are almost all broken, which btw, is the only place you'll find the rules for most servers since for some stupid reason they cant put that in this 6 YEAR OLD GAME. So you have it one of two ways. Either take the time, find the discord servers with the rules and get bodied for trying to follow them or ignore them and just hope you dont come across an admin.

The combo of server lag and trash hit boxes can make playing as any carnivore an extreme test of patience in the best scenario and a waste of hours of playtime at the worst. While dying is certainly part of the game, it should be because you've been outplayed or just did something stupid. Not because the game fails to do the literal only thing its actually supposed to do.

I was really excited about this game and I gave it a real shot. If it wasnt several years old Id say give it some time but with a game this age and even the most basic things being broken I dont have much hope."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"Okay. The Isle gives me mixed feelings. I absolutely love the gameplay, and the graphics look insane and run at a low cost even at the highest setting. Its honestly one of my favorite games I've ever played. With the exception of one major thing. The community. I knew and I didn't listen, I thought everyone was pulling my leg. They weren't. In fact they were undermining just how horrible the community, and developers are. I got harassed for about an hour non stop on a sandbox server before finally getting fed up with it enough to ask for help. The admins of the server themselves began catching an attitude with me just wanting to hang out. What the fuck? This wouldn't be an issue with Primal Carnage, a literal PVP death match game? As much as i loved this game growing up, I cant leave a beaming review without properly going over a MAJOR flaw of this game. The fans seem to inherit the developers ""Well even if I can help, I'm too lazy to be bothered to get off my ass and do something about it"" mentality. There's a handful of bugs, and some of the worst people I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. I've met a total of two cool people through this game whereas with BoB and PC:E, I have met countless. Please encourage your players to be more positive to their fellow players, or many just wont have the motivation to play anymore. I might only have 14 hours but that's enough for me to have seen the surface of how toxic the community is."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,Beta branch has not been stable for weeks and it's a new fatal error every update. Feeling like a lot of broken promises and minimal support is the final nail in the coffin.
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"This game used to be a sandbox in which you picked your favourite dinosaur and sat for a few hours to level up to a fully grown animal before sitting once again but this time surrounded by far smaller animals using you as an insurance policy, and before that was the progression system which, well no. Had the game remained in that state I would likely have voted it down but the new Evrima version of the game (which you can opt into under the Beta tab in properties) is actually very good. There aren't many animals to choose from in this early version of the rework yet it still feels 100x the living and breathing ecosystem that the original version wasn't. In Evrima all of the animals feel like classes with their own strengths, weaknesses and abilities. Evrima's Carnotaurus is a swift but tall pursuit predator that can run exceptionally fast in a straight line but fails to handle turns well, a good way of turning real science into compelling class strengths and weaknesses. The Utahraptor can grasp lunge and pin, as well as being generally very agile, and the newcomers to Evrima the Pteranodon which is the first aerial animal to be properly implemented, and the Deinosuchus which controls fantastically and feels like the most fleshed out of the four despite being one of the newest. The Deinosuchus does have the issue of facing nearly no competition once grown outside of being killed by other Deinosuchus players but this will likely change when the reworks for other animals are finished like the T-rex, and Spinosaurus especially as a rival aquatic class. This game has gone from feeling like an experimental chat room in which people growl at each-other to an actual class-based sandbox game and its genuinely exciting to see what comes next."

The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"It's a very fun game, but people cannibalizing their own kind for no reason is rampant and takes the fun out of the game. Imagine being a spinosaurus hatchling for hours, just drinking and eating, and when you're finally almost medium size mama logs off and a random group member kills you for no reason. There NEED to be HUGE debuffs for cannibalizing your own, and I will not recommend this game until it has been fixed."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"The game is gorgeous, the animations are superb, and the sound design is leagues ahead of any other immersive game I can think of besides Subnautica. That being said, the leadership of the game is an absolute mess to put it politely. Dondi is confused at best and willfully obstinate at worst. His leadership has left this game in purgatory for 5+ years. They went back to square 1 and aren't even anywhere close to what they had before. Sure, there are new mechanics and better animations but the gameplay loop is non-existant (not even nesting or different genders anymore) and the options to choose from are few. The hit boxes are also still questionable at best. The only thing that makes this game fun is when you have friends to play with and you troll other people. Maybe if the game ever gets done I can recommend it but if you pay anything over 5 bucks then it's a ripoff."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"Bought this game on sale. I could not make a private server. It loaded into a black screen. Asked the community about it and according to them, you need to turn your settings down and if that doesn't work, you are one of the people who can't play singleplayer due to a bug that has been known for years. Uhh ok? So attempted to join a server. Couldn't join any servers despite my graphics being turned down low (I have a beast of a computer anyway). I just got stuck on 11% in the loading screen on all servers. Again. A known bug that has existed for TWO YEARS. What the hell kind of dev priorities are those? How long can a game be in ""early access"" with such aggregious bugs like that? Just call the game what it is, unfinished and soon to be obsolete since they can't come out with fast fixes like POT is doing. I reccommend checking out what POT is up to instead because their devs are very active. Refund on The Isle requested."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"It's been years since I purchased this game, and I've played for too long to be deemed healthy by health professionals. Seeing where this game started, and where it is now, I can only say:

I am Disappointed. 

I joined when you could play exclusively in a progressive tree (Small dinosaurs for x amount of times leads to the next tier of dinosaurs) to produce an ecology of sorts. They added AI, more rivers and lakes and removed progression. This, with the idea of promoting a sort of self sustained ecology, backfired. Discords promote pay to grow (discord points through donating to help keep servers running for example), means there are servers that are 95%+ carnivores, and of those, are likely spinos/gigas/rexes. They can survive exclusively on the added AI (this was not possible when it first started), and if they die, they can come back as full grown top tier carnivores within minutes. There is no ecology. 

Combat went from hiding in bushes, to abusing broken hit-boxes, or crossing fingers that lag was working for you and not against you. Imagine playing Darksouls but your dagger has the range of a claymore at 2x size. 

Today? They have legacy (Beta) and Evrima (Beta Beta). Legacy is broken hitboxes and laggy, Evrima is testing a new combat system. Great. There is no effort to making a standing ecology however. both versions have rubber banding issues, and playing a single player is difficult and have GREATLY reduced odds if having to survive against clans/groups of friends. The removal of global chat in official servers have reduced the amount of -toxic- chat in game, but have successfully pushed people to using 3rd party programs with reduced capability of warning other players of misbehavior in servers. 

Promises. Promises. So many things promoted to publix that haven't seen light in years. ""Hypo"" Dinosaurs were seen briefly before being revoked from public access. Only devs could use them, and then devs stopped visiting server to show, no, -flaunt- this exclusive feature until the lack of existance. Humans being added? No. Cannibals being added? No. Vicious environments? No (Except for crippling fall damage from cliffs and drowning) Number of dinosaurs available for public use? Reduced. Number of customizable skins? Reduced (Earthy/muted Color palettes in Legacy have shown promise, but there is only 1 skin available and no color changing in Evirma currently)

I feel in the years that have passed by, that the isle has shown very very poor improvement, and I don't expect this game to be better for -several years- at the rate and history that it has shown. 

There was improvement for the first year. After that, it's been a heart break to watch this beast slowly decay and become ruined. The community is divided between people who hate the game and people who can only hope for the best. These two side will viciously attack the other in defense of their opinion. A quick youtube search or a visit to the isle reddit can give you any little bit of research to decide your fate on clicking 'Buy"".

I post this review as a warning. It's fun for a little bit, but for a long term game, set your expectations low. I'll watch updates, but highly not recommend people playing due to slow development, lacking features, and toxic community."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"The first thing to know about The Isle in 2021 is the two separate versions: Legacy and Evirma.

 Legacy is the ""default"" version of the game, and the version most people play. It has lots of dinosaur species and a very active playerbase, AI dinosaurs for carnivores to hunt down, massive well detailed maps dotted with human landmarks, rivers, lakes, mountains, jungles, grasslands and beaches, and two main gamemodes: survival and sandbox. In sandbox, every non-exclusive dinosaur in the game is playable. You start as an adult and basically do whatever you want. This can range from Death Matches to Dino Chatting Rooms. In survival, less species are available but the gameplay is more dynamic. You start as a baby dino, either a juvenile on your own or a hatchling with a mother. As you feed, hunt and survive, you grow in size and strength, becoming faster and more formidable until you become a fully grown adult. It is often necessary to form groups with members of your own species to better the chances of surviving. If you are a female dino, you can have your own young when you become adult (The nesting system allows other players to teleport to you as hatchling dinos, but they are completely dependent on you until they become juveniles.)

So that's what Legacy has to offer. But whats the catch?

Legacy is the abandoned version of The Isle, no longer receiving updates from the devs. As such, it has lots of bugs, ranging from minor annoyances to game breaking glitches such as oversized hitboxes, rubberbanding, FPS drops, disconnections and more. There are also a few ""tricks"" that undermine the basic values of the game, such as tail riding. It can be more than infuriating when you lose your dino to something only describable as bad game design. Food spawns are also fickle. Certain regions of the maps lack AI for carnivores or bushes for herbivores. As such, many players tend to gather around hot spots rather than explore the maps. There are also toxic players who partake in frowned upon behavior such as ""carebearing"" or taking care of dinos that arent your own species, or ""KOSing"" or killing everything in sight for fun.

Now what about Evirma?

Evirma is an entirely new version of The Isle, a complete recode that was started after the Legacy code became too troublesome and frustrating for the dev team to work with. It has a lot of the features that Legacy had with more yet to come, in addition to many exciting new features including an entirely new map, new dinosaurs, reworks of old dinosaurs, new mechanics such as grazing for herbivores, grabbing dragging and swallowing kills for carnivores, new playstyles for unique creatures like pteranodon and deinosuchus, and new systems for food, perks and elder dinosaurs. Everything in Evirma is much more fluent and natural than Legacy, from movement to combat to the ecology of every distinct species. 

The catch?

Evirma is somewhat bare bones as of now, possessing a far smaller dino roster than Legacy. some features like the diet and elder systems have yet to be added, and as usual there are bugs. However, there have been regular patches and bug fixes from the devs, with a roadmap for future large scale updates already planned out.

Overall, The Isle is a very unique take on the survival genre, and a delight for fans of dinosaurs and paleontology. Progress has been slow but steady, and the game already has a lot of promise with its dynamic gameplay. If you love survival games and dinosaurs, this ones for you. If you're more a fan of fast paced games, maybe pass on this one (Growth takes a while :D.)"
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"After 1325 Hours of this game I think I can give a decent Review...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEGACY IS DEAD - Not being updated at all and has hardly any player base at least for Australia.

Erivma is Alive - BUT is a toxic pool of Mixpacking Chinese hackers that will find you and hunt you down eventually due to ESP hacks. (They also love to sh!t talk in broken English while they kill you)

If you don't die to these people, you're most likely gonna die to people that just kill for sport, so in the long run its just a waste of time, no objective.. just mindlessly killing and eating.

Yes the official servers ""Have No Rules""  BUT that doesn't mean you should be hacking OR ruining the game for others by just making a MEGA PACK of 5 Stegos 5 Crocs and 8 Carnos to run and kill everyone on the Server..

Honestly at the end of the day I do love this game and have met many good friends, maybe I'll reinstall it some day when they fix these issues, but atm its unplayable for me."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I've played that game for quite a while now and I have to admit it's not for everyone.
it does have a lot of bugs but is still a loveable game.
once you know how to play and use specific dinosaurs it will bring a lot of fun.
at the beginning it will be frustrating but when you find the right people to play with it's going to be a lot of fun^^
may I wish you a happy hunt^^"
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,dino born- dino eat- dino die
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"One of the hardest ""Not recommended""s I've ever had to write up. On one hand, the game is unique, tense and fun. But on the other, it is a complete f**king headache to even bother playing or to work up the want to play it. 

In the base game, whatever stupid name you wanna give it. You have to contend with rules, admins and children the likes of which not seen since modern GMod, let alone the whining, crying and other annoying vitriol one puts up with. On top of that, the devs cannot handle criticism and throw bitch fits if someone has a differing opinion than them.

As for EVRIMA or the ""It'll work this time guys"" version:
Imagine spending hours, LITERAL HOURS trying to grow up or find other people so you can chat to someone finally or go for a drink/do something that isn't just wandering aimlessly with nothing in sight but the occasional fish. Now, you finally find others, members of your own species no less, you should be glad right? Wrong, it doesn't matter if you're utahraptor, deinosuchus, even a fucking pteradon. You will be attacked and cannibalized by your own species. Why? Because players are assholes and they've nothing better to do because EVRIMA is empty, and boring. 

TLDR: Great game but expect a lot of wasted time, headaches and dealing with shitters who kill you solely because they can and they were on the server for HOURS before you, meaning they had a day to waste getting big and ready to grief new spawns."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,Haha funny dinosaur game go brrrrr
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I do not recommend this game yet, it has so many bugs, almost as many as cyberpunk 2077, the development is super slow, and it's not worth your money right now, maybe in a year or so, cuz they update the game like every two months, and it's not even big updates."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,If a game can be a scam this is it.  The devs are incompetent and never produce updates on time or even the things they promised in the multiple road maps. Instead of improving the game they constantly break it with 'bug fixes' every time something new is introduced. This is the only game I have ever seen actually go BACKWARDS in development and become WORSE than it was before. Save you and your friends money and just get Beasts of Bermuda or Path of Titans.
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I have 10.8 hours in the game. This was right before envirma was a thing. The game was about a 5/10 at best in *legacy* mode. it was time consuming, empty, and rather boring. I LOVE dinosaurs and this game had a very good down to earth approach to them. There was no objective and most players resorted to creating their own ways to play. now flash forward a few days and envirma comes out. the game is now a 2/10 at best. When envirma launched it took out EVERYthing they worked on and players came to enjoy. It was laggy, unplayable, crashed all the time. and even less things to do and less dinos to play. The art and sound direction are the 2 points this game gets. they have spent so much time and money and resources recreating the game that im sure they will cease production in the coming years.

I got a good 8 hours out of regular of what you could call*fun* 
2 hours into envirma i could realize the ball was dropped and i never picked it up again.

Save your money until the devs put out some real ginormous fixes/changes/improvments.
I really wanted to like the game, but sadly it just wasn't good."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,miarrr
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I can play as a Dinosaur? Awesome. And it is, at first. If you can get used to the bugged controls, the wonky hit boxes, atrocious lag and server admins that only seem to care if something directly affects their game.

The links to the discords are almost all broken, which btw, is the only place you'll find the rules for most servers since for some stupid reason they cant put that in this 6 YEAR OLD GAME. So you have it one of two ways. Either take the time, find the discord servers with the rules and get bodied for trying to follow them or ignore them and just hope you dont come across an admin.

The combo of server lag and trash hit boxes can make playing as any carnivore an extreme test of patience in the best scenario and a waste of hours of playtime at the worst. While dying is certainly part of the game, it should be because you've been outplayed or just did something stupid. Not because the game fails to do the literal only thing its actually supposed to do.

I was really excited about this game and I gave it a real shot. If it wasnt several years old Id say give it some time but with a game this age and even the most basic things being broken I dont have much hope."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"Okay. The Isle gives me mixed feelings. I absolutely love the gameplay, and the graphics look insane and run at a low cost even at the highest setting. Its honestly one of my favorite games I've ever played. With the exception of one major thing. The community. I knew and I didn't listen, I thought everyone was pulling my leg. They weren't. In fact they were undermining just how horrible the community, and developers are. I got harassed for about an hour non stop on a sandbox server before finally getting fed up with it enough to ask for help. The admins of the server themselves began catching an attitude with me just wanting to hang out. What the fuck? This wouldn't be an issue with Primal Carnage, a literal PVP death match game? As much as i loved this game growing up, I cant leave a beaming review without properly going over a MAJOR flaw of this game. The fans seem to inherit the developers ""Well even if I can help, I'm too lazy to be bothered to get off my ass and do something about it"" mentality. There's a handful of bugs, and some of the worst people I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. I've met a total of two cool people through this game whereas with BoB and PC:E, I have met countless. Please encourage your players to be more positive to their fellow players, or many just wont have the motivation to play anymore. I might only have 14 hours but that's enough for me to have seen the surface of how toxic the community is."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,Beta branch has not been stable for weeks and it's a new fatal error every update. Feeling like a lot of broken promises and minimal support is the final nail in the coffin.
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"This game used to be a sandbox in which you picked your favourite dinosaur and sat for a few hours to level up to a fully grown animal before sitting once again but this time surrounded by far smaller animals using you as an insurance policy, and before that was the progression system which, well no. Had the game remained in that state I would likely have voted it down but the new Evrima version of the game (which you can opt into under the Beta tab in properties) is actually very good. There aren't many animals to choose from in this early version of the rework yet it still feels 100x the living and breathing ecosystem that the original version wasn't. In Evrima all of the animals feel like classes with their own strengths, weaknesses and abilities. Evrima's Carnotaurus is a swift but tall pursuit predator that can run exceptionally fast in a straight line but fails to handle turns well, a good way of turning real science into compelling class strengths and weaknesses. The Utahraptor can grasp lunge and pin, as well as being generally very agile, and the newcomers to Evrima the Pteranodon which is the first aerial animal to be properly implemented, and the Deinosuchus which controls fantastically and feels like the most fleshed out of the four despite being one of the newest. The Deinosuchus does have the issue of facing nearly no competition once grown outside of being killed by other Deinosuchus players but this will likely change when the reworks for other animals are finished like the T-rex, and Spinosaurus especially as a rival aquatic class. This game has gone from feeling like an experimental chat room in which people growl at each-other to an actual class-based sandbox game and its genuinely exciting to see what comes next."

The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"It's a very fun game, but people cannibalizing their own kind for no reason is rampant and takes the fun out of the game. Imagine being a spinosaurus hatchling for hours, just drinking and eating, and when you're finally almost medium size mama logs off and a random group member kills you for no reason. There NEED to be HUGE debuffs for cannibalizing your own, and I will not recommend this game until it has been fixed."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"The game is gorgeous, the animations are superb, and the sound design is leagues ahead of any other immersive game I can think of besides Subnautica. That being said, the leadership of the game is an absolute mess to put it politely. Dondi is confused at best and willfully obstinate at worst. His leadership has left this game in purgatory for 5+ years. They went back to square 1 and aren't even anywhere close to what they had before. Sure, there are new mechanics and better animations but the gameplay loop is non-existant (not even nesting or different genders anymore) and the options to choose from are few. The hit boxes are also still questionable at best. The only thing that makes this game fun is when you have friends to play with and you troll other people. Maybe if the game ever gets done I can recommend it but if you pay anything over 5 bucks then it's a ripoff."
The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"Bought this game on sale. I could not make a private server. It loaded into a black screen. Asked the community about it and according to them, you need to turn your settings down and if that doesn't work, you are one of the people who can't play singleplayer due to a bug that has been known for years. Uhh ok? So attempted to join a server. Couldn't join any servers despite my graphics being turned down low (I have a beast of a computer anyway). I just got stuck on 11% in the loading screen on all servers. Again. A known bug that has existed for TWO YEARS. What the hell kind of dev priorities are those? How long can a game be in ""early access"" with such aggregious bugs like that? Just call the game what it is, unfinished and soon to be obsolete since they can't come out with fast fixes like POT is doing. I reccommend checking out what POT is up to instead because their devs are very active. Refund on The Isle requested."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"I have a love hate relationship with this game, I love the artwork and content (even though some say it needs more and it does, it is slowly dying) I can 100% say there is no other game like this game and that is what makes it so special. 

Pros: 
Missions give you access to gear and items needed to play the game, they start from the beginning armor to end game gear (nothing thats 100% wanted but it gives you access to play end game content).

There is an arcade side of the game, which was the original concept. 4 gates consisting of 29 floors, but only 24 floors that have monsters. The arcade gates change every 7 days and its random, so every arcade run you do will be different from the last. 

If you wanna merchant, there is plenty of promos you can sink your money into. 

Cons: 
There is a ton of promos, one every 2 weeks. They throw promos out like they are candy and are not working toward new content and game updates. 

If you have to submitted a support ticket then you should expect 2-48 hours of waiting for a reply. This is how they get money out of you, they force you into paying for in-game items with real money cause you cant contact support when you have issues of not getting back into a party. 

The Develops and Gm's are not dedicated to running this game, and their minds are only after $$$$, but you are thinking what gaming company is not only after $$$$? All of them are, for the most part, but this one is one of the worst ones because as I stated they refuse to help you if you need help. I've heard ""sorry we couldnt help you out in time, maybe next time"" after they expected the rest of my party to wait 2-3 hours for me to get back into the party. 

You need to see this game as it truely is, It is only about pretty costumes and accessories and thats it. This game is mainly used to see who looks the best and as a chat room. Just think of this game as a chat room version of Tinder with mini games to play like PvP and missions etc. 


So end point is no i wouldn't recommend this game."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"This is a neat little game which isn't for everybody, But i personally enjoy it.
Pros (Hopefully with meaning)
+Easy and quick-to-learn controls make the players able to quickly adapt to the game.
+Fun and challenging level design keeping you on your toes with enemies and puzzles.
+Fun and challenging bossfights with great different mechanics to defeat each one.
+Easy to see everything on screen due to it being mostly top-down display.
Cons (With yet again, Hope of meaning)
-Can get repetetive with the grinding.
-Hard to beat the lowest-down (aka hardest) levels without friends on board.
-Playing with random people can be frustrating without proper communications.
-The crafting system requires lots of grinding to be done to gain the resources for each item.
In short its a well-balanced game and fun for people who enjoy quick bursts of action, time-taking puzzles and lots of multiplayer fun!

Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"I started playing this game to get the free tf2 items. However, while playing I got fond of it. Its really fun so I recommend this to not just TF2 players but everyone."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"This is one of the games I played with a great community. Its unique concept is like none others. I'd definitely recommend this game. It has its ""dying phase"" but I'm really hoping that the Game Devs are still planning to update and put more content to the game. I'd purchase things that this game offer if it gets updated. ( SHOUT OUT: Paging Grey Havens, Please proceed to the Game Dev room now... )

I know. It's boring if you're playing it alone. Make some friends, talk to strangers, don't be aloof. It's very addictive when you have people to share your moments with.

Here's what I thought: 

> Artstyle - Its cute and very unique
> Gameplay - Challenging. Well, not if you have good gears. Bottom line, its all about teamwork. Unless you like to play solo.
> Music - Lovely music you got there bud. Its engaging.
> Community - Its Great! That's why I love this game.
> Players - I'd say 50 - 50. Some players are nice and friendly, some are not.
> Concept - Can you name any game with the same concept? I can't. 
> Auction House - Oh my fudgy bars! Those are very expensive!
> Supply Depot - Nooo! The trade market keeps on raising! Make it stahp! 
> Grinding - Aw man, this is a bad RNG. Need 'em orbs please!
> Guilds - I don't know about you, but I love my guild. First and Last. 
> Wiki - Eh? Is the sidebar really down there? Hmm, care for a fix?
> Steam Login - Why can't I login my Steam to Wiki page? That's crazy, man! 
> Servers - Oh my, why do I have a red dot? Mind if you guys put up some Asian servers? Please?
> Patch Note - Oh come on!, Where the dang are the Patch Notes? I mean sure, you guys post updates on twitter... but....
> DLC - I'd be fine if you make more of 'em DLC's too. Like maybe, a side story like OCH?
> Price Boxes - Will you guys re-release Rageous Stuffs? I've been craving for them since I started playing...
> Coliseum - Ah, no ones playing there anymore. Make some more PVP. Maybe like Capture the Ball? or Chess? or Maze?
> Rank - Man, being a Vanguard ain't that good... What am I supposed to do now? Hoard stuffs? Collect gears?
> Story - The stoy is incomplete. We all got stranded in Cradle. So, there's more content you can actually make here... Like maybe go to the moon? Well, why not?, Cradle has a moon right there in the Main Screen. And what about our homeplanet? our homeworld? What? they're just... gone? Still so many plot holes. And maybe you can have a story on why the Snabolax, Jelly King, Roarmulus twins, and Vanaduke keep on respawning each time we delve deep into the unknow parts of Cradle. Maybe because TIME is reseting? Cause why not, it is the Clockworks... get it? 

Here's hoping, like most of the Knights out there who still enjoys playing this game, that it'll live on for another 5 or more years. Because I know it's not abandoned yet. https://twitter.com/Cronus_GH/status/829819314475765760

Good luck to the Devs - Grey Havens.
Kudos for keeping this game alive at the moment!"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"So here is the thing I am going to say my OPINION on this game. (I hope you read what is on caps :P)

Q:Is the game fun?
A:Yes, if you like to grind it is pretty fun and if you have friends to play it with you it will make the grind easier since your loot is ""shared"".

Q:How is the community?
A:I am not someone that can answer correctly that because I prefer to play solo instead with friends xD But from what I saw and interacted with I must say that the community is pretty good.

Q:I played a bit and saw almost no one, is it always like this?
A:Now, unfortunally, yes. When I played for the first time (2010 maybe) it had a lot of people.

Q:Is it pay to win?
A:No, not even close. You can convert 10k crowns(the game's currency) into energy(the paid currency).

Q:Why would I want the energy?
A:To not grind xD

TL;DR: Game is very grindy if you don't want to pay. Community pretty good but small. If you don't like to grind stay away. :)

Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,This is a fun arcade-style game that you can sink your teeth into and not get bored for a while. Something casual for me.
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,This is a fun game to play if your into mission type games. In this game you play as a knight taking on missions trying to recover lost valuables that have been lost when your ship had crashed. This game is an online game. Interact with others and make friends. Team up with people around the world or with your friends to take on missions. Level up your gear to take on harder levels. This game does not demand high system requirements to run. Overall a fun and interesting game to play.
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"except the starlight cradle update, it's dead





doesn't stop me from loving this game though"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"I use to play this game quite alot back in the old days, when in order to change the world you had to sink your gems into the elevator machine and hope it changed to something you liked. I check back in this game last year or so, and it's just gone down the crapper. Try doing a mission to progress your story: no one's on to join, and if they do, one death and they quit. Most of the people i've run into are just standing in front of the auction house, hoping some hard to get item appears, and the most popular guild i know hasn't been active in years. Add onto the fact that almost 99% of the stuff you want can only be bought with/accessed with real money, (and don't say that they don't. try getting a key for the endgame dungeon crafting station from the auction house. never gonna happen) and this is just another game that had 'pure' beginings and is now 'corrupted' into a pay2win model. -1/10
Also, LAG! LAG EVERYWHERE!!!
LAG!"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"it's ok


pros:
-> if you're a fan of top down fighting and dungeon crawling, this game can suck up your free time like a sponge
-> it's also a lot of fun to play with friends, up to a party of 4 players, from real life or haven
-> art style isn't shabby and pretty easy on the eyes, fun for any age range in the whole family
-> this game is already pretty old, but there's still a lot to do for newcomers and old pros alike
---> combat is very flush, with tons of flashy weapons and even more bad guys to use them on
---> there's plenty of background lore and tidbits like that hidden in this game if you're into that
---> feeling fabulous? theres lots of armor and accessories to help you look fly, and thats pretty fun
---> join or create a guild to form a small community with more than just 3 other players

cons:
-> there's a lot of incredibly useful hidden mechanics that the game really should teach you, like using your shield to cancel attack animations and increasing reaction time
-> a lot of the better weapons and armor can only be achieved through unconventional ways or buying it at an inflamed price, which can throw a wrench in your plans for your perfect arsenal
-> the game makes you grind a lot for ingame currency to be able to pass through a lot of the game
---> a remedy to this is if you do your homework and plan out what arsenal you want by the end of the game so that you dont make stupid descisions too early on in the game
---> the main issue with the grind wall is because of the ""alchemy orb"" crafting system and the ""hall of heroes"" quests that make sure you have the resources and equipment to go into higher difficulty floors

-> there's not really any recent updates at all anymore, and the community is slowly shrinking...

conclusion:
i think this game won't last that much longer anymore,
but you should still get it and play if you like top down shooters and dungeon crawlers;
i'm pretty sure this game is worth the free time it swallows despite being a free game"

Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"Not gonna lie i think i lost the counter of how much i edited this review.

This game sadly is in a bad state currently in terms of content
Tough the few players who still play are nice 

I personally loved this game alot, and i still do, well not the game itself, rather the community and its idea, its sorta complicated.

the gameplay isnt that complex, very simple infact, well most attacks are charge spams (unless its pvp, then its more complex) on hordes of enemies, this game feels like a mashup of bullet hell and a horde fighter if thats a used therm.

what i hate about it is well, the story didnt finish, to this day i havent heard how the story ends, how my character (or everyone's) saves Haven or something.

Im not sure about the Devs, if they have enough money or if theyre barelly able to pay rent, but i really wish to know how the story ends.

what could save this game is a workshop for items and such, hell maybe even map creators

Great for 1-2 hour play sessions of light dungeon crawling, looking for the next item you need to alchemize a cool sword. Also makes a good co-op game, as it's easy to pick up for new players.

Admittedly haven't reached the endgame, but that's not really why I play Spiral Knights."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,quite a gem
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"The hat is pretty good
Looks pretty fly on spy"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,this game has great potential i recommend this game if you like multiplayer online games its really good !
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,this is a nice dungeon crawled with swords guns and pets. its pretty fun:D
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,Is greatly fun but difficult to get the full 5 star armor
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,downloaded it - get the tf2 hat - delete
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"I have a love hate relationship with this game, I love the artwork and content (even though some say it needs more and it does, it is slowly dying) I can 100% say there is no other game like this game and that is what makes it so special. 

Pros: 
Missions give you access to gear and items needed to play the game, they start from the beginning armor to end game gear (nothing thats 100% wanted but it gives you access to play end game content).

There is an arcade side of the game, which was the original concept. 4 gates consisting of 29 floors, but only 24 floors that have monsters. The arcade gates change every 7 days and its random, so every arcade run you do will be different from the last. 

If you wanna merchant, there is plenty of promos you can sink your money into. 

Cons: 
There is a ton of promos, one every 2 weeks. They throw promos out like they are candy and are not working toward new content and game updates. 

If you have to submitted a support ticket then you should expect 2-48 hours of waiting for a reply. This is how they get money out of you, they force you into paying for in-game items with real money cause you cant contact support when you have issues of not getting back into a party. 

The Develops and Gm's are not dedicated to running this game, and their minds are only after $$$$, but you are thinking what gaming company is not only after $$$$? All of them are, for the most part, but this one is one of the worst ones because as I stated they refuse to help you if you need help. I've heard ""sorry we couldnt help you out in time, maybe next time"" after they expected the rest of my party to wait 2-3 hours for me to get back into the party. 

You need to see this game as it truely is, It is only about pretty costumes and accessories and thats it. This game is mainly used to see who looks the best and as a chat room. Just think of this game as a chat room version of Tinder with mini games to play like PvP and missions etc. 


So end point is no i wouldn't recommend this game."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"This is a neat little game which isn't for everybody, But i personally enjoy it.
Pros (Hopefully with meaning)
+Easy and quick-to-learn controls make the players able to quickly adapt to the game.
+Fun and challenging level design keeping you on your toes with enemies and puzzles.
+Fun and challenging bossfights with great different mechanics to defeat each one.
+Easy to see everything on screen due to it being mostly top-down display.
Cons (With yet again, Hope of meaning)
-Can get repetetive with the grinding.
-Hard to beat the lowest-down (aka hardest) levels without friends on board.
-Playing with random people can be frustrating without proper communications.
-The crafting system requires lots of grinding to be done to gain the resources for each item.
In short its a well-balanced game and fun for people who enjoy quick bursts of action, time-taking puzzles and lots of multiplayer fun!
(Yes, I took time out of my sleeping pattern to write this review, Thats how sad i am.)"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"I started playing this game to get the free tf2 items. However, while playing I got fond of it. Its really fun so I recommend this to not just TF2 players but everyone."
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"This is one of the games I played with a great community. Its unique concept is like none others. I'd definitely recommend this game. It has its ""dying phase"" but I'm really hoping that the Game Devs are still planning to update and put more content to the game. I'd purchase things that this game offer if it gets updated. ( SHOUT OUT: Paging Grey Havens, Please proceed to the Game Dev room now... )

I know. It's boring if you're playing it alone. Make some friends, talk to strangers, don't be aloof. It's very addictive when you have people to share your moments with.

Here's what I thought: 

> Artstyle - Its cute and very unique
> Gameplay - Challenging. Well, not if you have good gears. Bottom line, its all about teamwork. Unless you like to play solo.
> Music - Lovely music you got there bud. Its engaging.
> Community - Its Great! That's why I love this game.
> Players - I'd say 50 - 50. Some players are nice and friendly, some are not.
> Concept - Can you name any game with the same concept? I can't. 
> Auction House - Oh my fudgy bars! Those are very expensive!
> Supply Depot - Nooo! The trade market keeps on raising! Make it stahp! 
> Grinding - Aw man, this is a bad RNG. Need 'em orbs please!
> Guilds - I don't know about you, but I love my guild. First and Last. 
> Wiki - Eh? Is the sidebar really down there? Hmm, care for a fix?
> Steam Login - Why can't I login my Steam to Wiki page? That's crazy, man! 
> Servers - Oh my, why do I have a red dot? Mind if you guys put up some Asian servers? Please?
> Patch Note - Oh come on!, Where the dang are the Patch Notes? I mean sure, you guys post updates on twitter... but....
> DLC - I'd be fine if you make more of 'em DLC's too. Like maybe, a side story like OCH?
> Price Boxes - Will you guys re-release Rageous Stuffs? I've been craving for them since I started playing...
> Coliseum - Ah, no ones playing there anymore. Make some more PVP. Maybe like Capture the Ball? or Chess? or Maze?
> Rank - Man, being a Vanguard ain't that good... What am I supposed to do now? Hoard stuffs? Collect gears?
> Story - The stoy is incomplete. We all got stranded in Cradle. So, there's more content you can actually make here... Like maybe go to the moon? Well, why not?, Cradle has a moon right there in the Main Screen. And what about our homeplanet? our homeworld? What? they're just... gone? Still so many plot holes. And maybe you can have a story on why the Snabolax, Jelly King, Roarmulus twins, and Vanaduke keep on respawning each time we delve deep into the unknow parts of Cradle. Maybe because TIME is reseting? Cause why not, it is the Clockworks... get it? 

Here's hoping, like most of the Knights out there who still enjoys playing this game, that it'll live on for another 5 or more years. Because I know it's not abandoned yet. https://twitter.com/Cronus_GH/status/829819314475765760

Good luck to the Devs - Grey Havens.
Kudos for keeping this game alive at the moment!"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"So here is the thing I am going to say my OPINION on this game. (I hope you read what is on caps :P)

Q:Is the game fun?
A:Yes, if you like to grind it is pretty fun and if you have friends to play it with you it will make the grind easier since your loot is ""shared"".

Q:How is the community?
A:I am not someone that can answer correctly that because I prefer to play solo instead with friends xD But from what I saw and interacted with I must say that the community is pretty good.

Q:I played a bit and saw almost no one, is it always like this?
A:Now, unfortunally, yes. When I played for the first time (2010 maybe) it had a lot of people.

Q:Is it pay to win?
A:No, not even close. You can convert 10k crowns(the game's currency) into energy(the paid currency).

Q:Why would I want the energy?
A:To not grind xD

TL;DR: Game is very grindy if you don't want to pay. Community pretty good but small. If you don't like to grind stay away. :)

Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,This is a fun arcade-style game that you can sink your teeth into and not get bored for a while. Something casual for me.
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,This is a fun game to play if your into mission type games. In this game you play as a knight taking on missions trying to recover lost valuables that have been lost when your ship had crashed. This game is an online game. Interact with others and make friends. Team up with people around the world or with your friends to take on missions. Level up your gear to take on harder levels. This game does not demand high system requirements to run. Overall a fun and interesting game to play.
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"except the starlight cradle update, it's dead





doesn't stop me from loving this game though"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"I use to play this game quite alot back in the old days, when in order to change the world you had to sink your gems into the elevator machine and hope it changed to something you liked. I check back in this game last year or so, and it's just gone down the crapper. Try doing a mission to progress your story: no one's on to join, and if they do, one death and they quit. Most of the people i've run into are just standing in front of the auction house, hoping some hard to get item appears, and the most popular guild i know hasn't been active in years. Add onto the fact that almost 99% of the stuff you want can only be bought with/accessed with real money, (and don't say that they don't. try getting a key for the endgame dungeon crafting station from the auction house. never gonna happen) and this is just another game that had 'pure' beginings and is now 'corrupted' into a pay2win model. -1/10
Also, LAG! LAG EVERYWHERE!!!
LAG!"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"it's ok


pros:
-> if you're a fan of top down fighting and dungeon crawling, this game can suck up your free time like a sponge
-> it's also a lot of fun to play with friends, up to a party of 4 players, from real life or haven
-> art style isn't shabby and pretty easy on the eyes, fun for any age range in the whole family
-> this game is already pretty old, but there's still a lot to do for newcomers and old pros alike
---> combat is very flush, with tons of flashy weapons and even more bad guys to use them on
---> there's plenty of background lore and tidbits like that hidden in this game if you're into that
---> feeling fabulous? theres lots of armor and accessories to help you look fly, and thats pretty fun
---> join or create a guild to form a small community with more than just 3 other players

cons:
-> there's a lot of incredibly useful hidden mechanics that the game really should teach you, like using your shield to cancel attack animations and increasing reaction time
-> a lot of the better weapons and armor can only be achieved through unconventional ways or buying it at an inflamed price, which can throw a wrench in your plans for your perfect arsenal
-> the game makes you grind a lot for ingame currency to be able to pass through a lot of the game
---> a remedy to this is if you do your homework and plan out what arsenal you want by the end of the game so that you dont make stupid descisions too early on in the game
---> the main issue with the grind wall is because of the ""alchemy orb"" crafting system and the ""hall of heroes"" quests that make sure you have the resources and equipment to go into higher difficulty floors

-> there's not really any recent updates at all anymore, and the community is slowly shrinking...

conclusion:
i think this game won't last that much longer anymore,
but you should still get it and play if you like top down shooters and dungeon crawlers;
i'm pretty sure this game is worth the free time it swallows despite being a free game"

Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"The game is fun, but the ""stamina"" system does not belong in a PC game/"
Spiral Knights,Massively%20Multiplayer,99900,"Not gonna lie i think i lost the counter of how much i edited this review.

This game sadly is in a bad state currently in terms of content
Tough the few players who still play are nice 

I personally loved this game alot, and i still do, well not the game itself, rather the community and its idea, its sorta complicated.

the gameplay isnt that complex, very simple infact, well most attacks are charge spams (unless its pvp, then its more complex) on hordes of enemies, this game feels like a mashup of bullet hell and a horde fighter if thats a used therm.

what i hate about it is well, the story didnt finish, to this day i havent heard how the story ends, how my character (or everyone's) saves Haven or something.

Im not sure about the Devs, if they have enough money or if theyre barelly able to pay rent, but i really wish to know how the story ends.

what could save this game is a workshop for items and such, hell maybe even map creators

all wraped up, i do and dont recommend this game, more like a ""your own risk thing"" due to the main story not being finished."

DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,454650,"Very Very fun Dragon Ball game in general, super addictive, been playing since beta of first Xenoverse game and can't tell you how many times I've repurchased the dlc for different platforms. But there is always going to be one thing that holds this game back and that's the fact that once in a blue moon you'll find someone playing something PvE wise online. I still actively play this and, be still my heart, get excited unlocking something for a character that people have had for a long time. This game used to be so exciting whenever the PvE scene was as active as the PvP scene and even in that category it's filled with cheesers who abuse namekian grabs and CC chain lock abilities making it unfun as well. Hoping that in this next expansion this game will see some light and hopefully as well get some community love. But until then, if you're a first time buyer, I would not recommend unless you have some friends to play with who will be just as active as you are due to the pricing. So if you're looking for help in grinding something or wanting to do things in PvE, feel free to add me and message me and I would gladly come and participate!"
DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,454650,"TL;DR: The game is fun if you are a dragon ball fan, but I'd play it with friends if you can. Also, wait for sales if you care about the dlc, otherwise play it for what it's worth. 

I've played this game so much across so many platforms that I can tell you pretty much anything about this game.
I will tell you outright that you will only enjoy this game if you are a fairly big fan of dragon ball. Even then, the game will absolutely test your patience at times. There are straight up BAD parts of this game. That being said, because I am a gigantic dragon ball fan I absolutely love it. 

If you're looking to scratch that itch of playing a dragon ball game that feels similar to games from the budokai tenkaichi or raging blast series' then this is the game. It's not really all that complex to play, but you feel like you're a dragon ball character (which is especially cool since you get to make your own character as well). It's not really a *fighting* game, so don't expect FighterZ level complexity (also a dope game). 

The main draw this game has on me (besides being a dragon ball game) is honestly being able to play with friends. It has plenty of PVE stuff for you to do in the form of the hundred or so parallel quests (which can also be added to with dlc). It's got that large character roster that you'd expect from the aforementioned games (though the characters also aren't all 100% unique).

The biggest negative from this game is more so the business side instead of the game side. The game is expensive as fuck. It's 5 years old still basically full priced, and it contains so many dlc packs that enhance the life of the game. If you want EVERYTHING the game can offer, the dlc is *kind of* necessary. I say it's kind of necessary because at a point you just become so damn strong that most of the missions become chump change, and the dlc quests that are added are notoriously hard as dicks. You can pass on the dlc if you don't really care about any of the characters they add/want new missions. If you want the COMPLETE game, I highly suggest waiting until the game is under $10 with special pricing on the dlc. I bought the game as gift for a friend recently and with EVERYTHING it was about the same price as the base game normally is. 

The other really annoying business side of the game is that it does have some F2P game mechanics. There is an in-game currency that allows to get clothes, skills, etc. You don't have to pay any of it, but I find it frustrating that they have these predatory business practices in a game that you could very well be paying over $100 for (base game and all the dlc packs.)

Overall, it's a game I find myself getting sucked back into time and time again. 

Plus, you can dress up as Mr. Satan while being a SSJB shooting a big bang attack, and I think there's something beautiful about that.

DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,454650,better than slapshot
DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,454650,This game is worth playing only with mods
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"First major concern a lot of people have about LOTRO - is it dead?

No. It still has a very healthy playerbase, big enough that the even the RP servers feel populated. So don't let your worries about population turn you away.

This is a classic MMORPG. It's going to be familiar to anyone that has played Everquest, DAoC, WoW, etc. While it means you're not getting any particularly amazing new mechanics, the perk is that LOTRO has figured out how to get the best out of those systems. Leveling feels well-progressed, classes are (mostly) balanced, and there is a lot of variety even within the classes to provide lots of replay value and ways to mitigate strengths and weaknesses.

LOTRO might have the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I recommend turning off battle music and just enjoying the compositions. Bree, as well as the various Inns and Halls located therein, have some fantastic scores attached to them.

Let's be honest though - if you play LOTRO you're probably here because it's Lord of the Rings. And in that regard, you will not be disappointed. The game is steeped in the lore - books and films - and has little nods to it scattered everywhere that are rewarding for someone that is really into their Tolkien scholarship. This is not a LotR skin thrown over a MMORPG framework - this is Middle Earth proper. Even with dated graphics (updates are coming soon, as of this writing) it's still a joy to look at. If you're rolling through some place like the Shire, you'll be able to soak in that sleepy, bucolic atmosphere that the movies portrayed so well.

This is a great MMO experience, and I usually find MMOs tedious. Moreover, it's free - so your excuses to at least try it out are non-existent."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"The steam client is trash.

[b] BUT [/b]

The game is amazing, It looks stunning for a game that came out when it did and the newer areas show the love the developers have put into the game, I dont use the steam client though because it has caused me some issues.

PROS:
[list]
[*] Follows LOTR lore almost perfectly
[*] Classes are varied
[*] Community is always friendly
[*] THE MUSIC SYSTEM! Its so good. You can either play by hand or use .abc & .midi files to play instruments in game!
[/list]

CONS:
[list]
[*] Quests are boring if you dont read the quest text, They seem to have no point unless you dive into the story
[*] Difficult to start if your not a ""VIP"" member. Dont let this put you off! you can get everything legitimatley without paying a dime!

The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Love this game. Been playing it for many years. It's really remarkable. Definitely the best 'escape' game out there. Music is really chill, the world and art is beautiful and the gameplay is fairly easy going.

My only complaint about it is that after so many years, it can get a little repetitive but that's mostly my fault for playing it so much. There is quite a bit of grinding involved, but it's mostly enjoyable and there's so much variety in the game that you can change gears all the time and keep yourself engaged in countless activities."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Still one of the most most immersive and fun MMORPGs. Also the most gentle freemium model that I have seen. Older graphics. Great music. Fellowships. Kinships. Houses. Dungeons and quests.
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I have been playing this game from Alpha stage, granted it is older graphics but not the worst out there. Many many hours of gameplay to be head with fantastic content if your a fan of the Movies, Books, etc. then give it a try. I personally love the game and the community is one of the best I have seen."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I love to play this game just to unwind and take in the scenary of Middle-Earth. It's a great game to play with friends or also alone. It's free-to-play but there is content blocked by a pay wall. Technically, you can get past the pay wall by just playing the game but it's a monotonous grind. I listen to the ""LOTRO Podcast"" while playing this game and it's really relaxing. Overall, highly recommended."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"This is probably one of my favorite things to review...as you can tell by my hours..198.8 hours total, BUT I have 64.9 Hours just in two weeks, thats how addicting this game can be, that is with no sitting around, no afking or etc..it's a very fun game..But with the fanboying aside lets get to what you guys came for and give my Pros and Cons

Pros:
Great Community (very helpful no matter what server your on)
Beautiful Atmosphere
Never breaks the tolkien universe feeling (which means always feels like your really in the Tolkien Universe) 
Great Variety in Weapons, skill sets, and armors, you will rarely find someone with the same kind of armor and or weapon as you or even close for that matter
Very Unique in its own way, personally I love the cosmetic system, it adds this feeling to kind of drive you into the universe more so you can kinda be more in character, feel like your there (Cosmetic system, allows you to equip armor and weapons that you would personally think suits you, so for man it would be ranger armor and etc, dwarves heavy dwarven armor and etc...Personally it a great feature as it gives a better feeling to it) 
Teams still working on the game, making it much better with every update!
Added a new race called Beorning with the class (their like druids, for WoW players you turn into a bear pretty much lol) But also hard to get on free to play..but possible!
Has own servers for Roleplayers (so if your into kind of the Tolkien universe for LOTR that you know a lot about roleplaying and stuff give it a shot, people are very forgiving on Laurelin (the EU and US RP server) along with other servers as well.
Has some wonderfu crafting mechanics that could very much benefit you if you are in a Kinship (kind of like a clan) you can help each other have the gear you need to FIGHT For middle earth!

Cons:
Sadly, helps the VIP a lot, with all expansions and etc unlocked
F2P's have to ""farm"" all their points in order to level
F2P's have a huge grind
Sometimes you could be looked down upon from being a f2p by VIP's (more my personal experience but still, something to be careful about)
Time Consuming farming (not too much of a complaint as that's how its suppose to be XD)
Graphics for character are out of date (expected of course from 2009)
Some areas can be depressing yes, but that DOESN'T mean its still not beautiful, you could be taken away by the beautiful areas around Angmar, or the huge mountains in Moria or just in the Misty Mountains great places to go (harder to get to if your F2P, trust me..I farmed the points, tough but worth it) 

These are of course my personal Pros and Cons, as you would expect, but most of them were based off of other people's reactions to the game and stuff like that, so it is not just me spewing a bunch of stuff out for someone to read :P I hoped you loved the review, and trust me I'd gladly give it a 10/10 course it has its flaws but it is still beautiful, fun, and interesting.

And always remember....Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! (which means...Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!) Sorry i'm a dwarf Junkie myself! :P I love dwarves and their history in the Tolkien universe."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"to steam dev.
the downloadable content from steam is too outdated, please update your  game, so steam dont refuse our updated version and delete it then try to re-download the outdated content from your servers"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"10 years and still fascinating millions of people world wide. Lotro is right behind WoW and Everquest in long time popularity. For good reasons. The community loves Tolkiens world and they treat eachother with respect and open arms. The most important game in my long history of gaming - an MMO legend you should not miss if you are interested in Middle Earth and its tales. What Peter JAckson did for the books in the movie world, Turbine the developer did for the gaming world. A beautiful and surprisingly accurate depiction of the books and scriptures of JRR Tolkien. A timeless Art Direction makes the game still look relevant today. 
Join the greatest Fantasy Universe ever imagined."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Lotro's graphics maybe somewhat dated at the moment and mechanically it does not stand out to much from other mmos using the same model, but the game does justice to the breadth and scope of Middle Earth and Tolkien's deep lore. I recommend this game to people who value small ambient touches in a game over wow factor and of course to any readers of the Professor."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Great MMO that's actually totally F2P if you don't mind farming special currency.
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"If you're a Tolkien fan, you should love this. It's a lot of fun seeing how much care and attention has gone into recreating the world of middle earth. 
As an MMO, it is one of the best ones out. It is certainly more geared to solo players, but does a good job of catering to everyone. The classes range from basic to some of the most advanced and interesting classes I've ever seen in an MMO. (Take Warden or LoreMaster for example)! The community is also one of the friendliest and the servers are still busy and alive to this day. It has stood the test of time and still looks astonishingly beautiful as ever. Add to all that it has fantastic mood setting music you've got a class A product. Many players simply can't stop at a single character and over the years I have kept on coming back to this game. Without a doubt my favourite MMO ever. It's also great to see the dedication of Standing Stone in keeping their work alive and keeping lotro safe for the future years with a decent, not overly greedy free to play system. Much of the content can be enjoyed for free and extras can be bought as required. The only time you may consider spending money is to open up quest packs in different regions and expansion packs. But considering the size and amount of time you could foreseeably spend in this masterpiece, it is well worth it!"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"My playtime should say enough.
"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I present you the video passage of the game Lord of the Rings Online, more precisely, its main storyline, which is here proudly called ""epic"". Numerous side quests scattered throughout Middle-earth will not enter this passage, since for the most part they are tasks like ""kill 5 goblins"" or ""bring 10 wolf tails"" and, with rare exceptions, are not worthy of our attention. But the main storyline is very interesting and, most importantly, it very closely intersects with the plot of the books ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit."" We will meet a lot of familiar characters, take part in familiar events and how to properly ponostalgiruem.

I will make a reservation that this video passage was created in order to consider the plot of the game and compare it with the books ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"", and not run through the whole game, skipping past the description of the quests and doing endless shooting of monsters. Passage does not carry the main purpose of suggesting something to the players (although not without this, of course). Here, rather nostalgia, combined with the analysis of the plot and its connection with the original, untouched universe."
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Fun game, although you feel kinda left out if you don't pay money into the game. It's not impossible to progress without money, but the game askes for it a lot. 

It's kinda a fun game without money, but recommened playing with friends or else it gets boring fast.

It has skill trees which is always fun in games. Archer is OP in 1v1's late game, I reccomened though!"
The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Best mmo and best gaming community I have ever encountered, how old the game is doesn't make it look bad at all, it makes it feel kind of special. Only bad thing is that the game has a bad tutorial. It is free to play but there is dlc.  U can buy them with a very rare in-game currency that takes a long time to get but most people buy most of them. PvP is Like no other game and amazing. U can play as orcs and spiders or the free people of middle earth, there is a big PvP region where there are out posts to capture that give buffs, castles that if defeated join your faction and give you quests, and an entire secret underground world filled with bosses, not to mention towns and mines to do quests and farm so u never even have to fight another player if you don't want to. You are going to want to work in groups of at least two though to survive, especially if u are low rank because there are high levels from the other faction roaming and npcs meant to fight groups of people."

Rec Room,Sports,471710,"I finally decided to leave a review of this game after seeing the AMA on Reddit, because I want to support these guys any way I can. Everything about this game makes you happy. Everyone's always smiling (because your character can only smile), other players are extremely friendly (its totally normal for people to compliment you or congratulate you if you hit them in paintball), and the devs are just as feel-good as the game itself. They are extremely responsive to the community and really have a way of making everyone feel special. I sent Against Gravity an email recently, and the response I got came back less than six hours later not from some intern, but from the CEO. And in the AMA, when someone asked how they could support the company financially, the response was to instead to make a donation to charity and to ""tell 'em coach sent ya"". They're small gestures, but it really shows that they care.


In a world where it seems like we are constantly being bombarded with negativity, and where everyone is divided, this game is like a haven of positivity. Much like the reviews, the game itself is ""overwhelmingly positive"""
Rec Room,Sports,471710,"best VR game ever. WHY ARE ALL THE FREE GAMES THE BEST ONES? there ain't even any forced micro-transactions!

Rec Room,Sports,471710,"Damn, this game has everything you could ever want in a VR game! Ok, granted, it does not have EVERYTHING a VR game has to offer, but it comes close! The experience you get from this game is awesome. The community is great, you can play with friends, and with the new addition of Quest, lots of fun games to choose from! And on top of that, the game is free and the developers actually respond and change the game according to the playerbase! Best multyplayer VR game, hands down. Infinity/10"

I think this game is overlooked by some people but if you spend some time inside you it becomes a real Gem.
I notice on vrlfg website that there are more players online around the clock than most multiplayer VR games.
It has been under continous development improving more and more every month.
When you first start the game there is a computer where you can add all your steam friends.
With your wrist watch you can easily change games servers, invite friends etc.
My favorites: Paintball, Jumbotron Quest and Lounge room.
Rise of the Jumbotron Quest: The asthetics of lighting color and sound are the best of any vr game I have seen. It is challenging, but I did beat it 3 times 😊
Paintball: Endless fun. Lounge room: So fun with friends, tell jokes on stage, draw things with the 3d marker, play cards whatever best for private gatherings.
Children under 13 arent allowed and it is very easy to kick using the wristwatch interface."
Rec Room,Sports,471710,Gnarly game for free. First time playing VR and I played this game. Met some cool people so far!! Amazing game to met friends!!

Paintball is challenging, and there are a few small ""invisible walls"" you think you can shoot through, but you just splatter paint. That aside, great game! ..You get the excitement of paintball without the welts.

Rec Room,Sports,471710,"I finally decided to leave a review of this game after seeing the AMA on Reddit, because I want to support these guys any way I can. Everything about this game makes you happy. Everyone's always smiling (because your character can only smile), other players are extremely friendly (its totally normal for people to compliment you or congratulate you if you hit them in paintball), and the devs are just as feel-good as the game itself. They are extremely responsive to the community and really have a way of making everyone feel special. I sent Against Gravity an email recently, and the response I got came back less than six hours later not from some intern, but from the CEO. And in the AMA, when someone asked how they could support the company financially, the response was to instead to make a donation to charity and to ""tell 'em coach sent ya"". They're small gestures, but it really shows that they care.


In a world where it seems like we are constantly being bombarded with negativity, and where everyone is divided, this game is like a haven of positivity. Much like the reviews, the game itself is ""overwhelmingly positive"""

I think this game is overlooked by some people but if you spend some time inside you it becomes a real Gem.
I notice on vrlfg website that there are more players online around the clock than most multiplayer VR games.
It has been under continous development improving more and more every month.
When you first start the game there is a computer where you can add all your steam friends.
With your wrist watch you can easily change games servers, invite friends etc.
My favorites: Paintball, Jumbotron Quest and Lounge room.
Rise of the Jumbotron Quest: The asthetics of lighting color and sound are the best of any vr game I have seen. It is challenging, but I did beat it 3 times 😊
Paintball: Endless fun. Lounge room: So fun with friends, tell jokes on stage, draw things with the 3d marker, play cards whatever best for private gatherings.
Children under 13 arent allowed and it is very easy to kick using the wristwatch interface."

Deadside,Massively%20Multiplayer,895400,I don't recommend this game to people just because of the issues I have had with trying to have fun with the game. I have played on a few servers that had a lot of people on them but the server died really quickly and left it with just me on it for weeks. If you try and play on populated servers like US 300 you will not be able to get any gear right away and will spend hours just trying to get a full kit. People on any server I have been on all call you racist things because you killed them or got the jump on them and they lost their gear. Now the main reason why I don't recommend this game is IT IS A RUNNING SIMULATOR!! You will spend 5 min running from one place to another just to fill your inventory and have to run back to safe zone or your base. Also the AI in this game are just ridiculously hard when you are just starting out. Now in order to get better gear in this game you really can only do pve content as spending money will take hundreds of thousands just to get the 2nd best tier of gear. Now unless you like playing on dead servers there is no fun really and when you play on any server that has people on it its only like 3 servers AT MOST that have anyone on them and they are almost always full. Now this game does have plenty of potential but the devs are TERRIBLE at posting content and take months to get anything out.If they could pump out stuff faster instead of working on stuff that doesn't matter in the game this could easily be a DayZ killer but it will never be at this rate with 3 updates since launch over a year ago

Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"This game has great potential and I would like to see it succeed but after nearly 400 hours of play time and several wars I can not in good conscience recommend the game in it's current state, although I wish I could.

There's simply far too many balance issues the developers don't seem to take very seriously and move very slowly to fix but by far the biggest issue the game has is the ability for literally one person with too much time and too much money to ruin entire wars for everyone by simply buying multiple accounts. Do they ban people if they get caught? Sometimes, sure, but it's not a solution to the actual problem and now they want to increase the price of the game in the near future? That's fucked up because they have no incentive to fix the actual issue which is the way the tech in the game works and people cheating makes them money and them making money off people who cheat gives them no incentive to fix it.

For example, you could buy and create a fresh account, join the opposing faction and just run around to the engineering centers, public refineries and public stockpiles and collect any of the tech materials that may be sitting there, grab them, and go drop them in a bush somewhere or in water which literally ruins the game for everyone but more so the faction it's being done to. People complain about it, report the person, the devs usually EVENTUALLY ban them but it doesn't solve anything because that person, if they have the money and devotion to being an asshat, can just rinse and repeat the process, but there's always several people doing it, on both sides, every war and it's simply not fun and dumb.

I also don't like how they manually change the tech trees between each war to however they see fit. I would much rather have both sides get the same static trees every war that allow the ability to tech whatever is possible for each faction and let the players decide what they want teched to use without the interference of devs because honestly they kinda suck at creating fair and balanced options.

For me personally those are the 2 most game breaking factors that make it not fun and make me unable to recommend it, but there are more. The stealing/cheating isn't limited to just tech materials, but literally anything that's not in a private stockpile. They can steal and destroy any vehicle that's just chilling or go to any bunker base and just withdraw and destroy any equipment sitting in them but the tech stealing/cheating has the greatest overall impact in my opinion.

I also don't enjoy anything in the game combat related and spend the time I do playing just doing logistical stuff because I absolutely hate that if you want to be effective and have an advantage you have to literally downgrade your aspect ratio to 4:3 and you just look and aim at the very corner of your screen.

The building in the game needs serious attention as well. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about it because it doesn't much matter until the other stuff is fixed, but I'll just say it's boring and tedious as fuck and I'm surprised that even a few people enjoy doing it but not surprised that there's always a ton of undefended areas across the entire map on both sides because it's simply not fun or enjoyable at all to the point it's not even worth learning how to do because it's just a chore.

1.) Fix the alt/cheating problem by reworking the entire tech system so it's not possible for 1 dedicated person to ruin the entire game let alone several people, and so that the devs don't profit from cheaters.

2.) Stop making up tech trees each war. Create and settle on static tech trees that provide the option for players to tech into what they want instead of adding/removing different weapons & vehicles every other war. It's dumb and it literally takes away content that we paid for.

3.) Change the way the camera works so combat is actually fun and fair. I don't like how if you move your mouse to the edge of the screen it extends your vision range. I think locking the screen in place like Diablo or Path of Exile would make combat feel more fair and fun with the exception of using binoculars, because you can't fire a weapon while using them anyway.

4.) Building needs serious attention. It's boring, a chore and not intuitive at all.

I recommend NOT buying the game until 1 & 2 are resolved because they majorly impact the game in a negative way, especially if they plan to increase the price of the game without resolving those issues. 

#3 is debatable and more of a personal preference thing I suppose, but as it stands I don't enjoy the combat and it leaves me perplexed on how others do.

#4 is irrelevant until 1 & 2 are fixed but building sucks.

Minor things that's aren't game breaking but would be very nice and welcomed quality of life changes would be more customization of regiments and squads and the ability to mark and draw out operation plans in game instead of having to take screenshots, edit them and use things like discord to set stuff up as well as the ability to regiment lock stuff as well as squad lock and include that locking ability to bunkers. 

 It would also be nice to be able to customize the chat box size, position, font, ability to create our own chat rooms ect. Think of World of Warcraft chat and put it in Foxhole and that would resolve that."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Good stuff first. There's nothing like this game. The experience is truly unique at its best and this game has some of the best player interactions I've experienced. While it isn't for everyone, it feels really good to be one person in a sea of hundreds in one large battle.

However. This game has been greatly damaged by feature creep. The game now has asymmetric technology which means teams get different weapons and vehicles. This sounds fine in theory. But in practice it is hard to balance and the devs do not seem capable of balancing. You will see faction specific technology give one side a serious advantage resulting in several IRL days worth of unbearable gameplay before the roles switch and the other side gets stomped. This make the game annoying to play half the time and then pointless feeling the other half.

The game also sees devs meddling to prolong wars. This recent war, the devs added a 50 second respawn timer when we were making good progress. Then when we made another successful push, the devs added a 60 second respawn and kept it for 2 days until we were pushed back, even keeping it during low population. This killed any enthusiasm I had. It's clear the devs have ways to nudge the war in a direction they want, removing agency from the players.

I'd say keep your eye on this one if you're interested. Wait a year or two and take the criticism seriously. Even if you purchase now and enjoy it, you may find the devs change everything you liked about it."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"I've driven many miles hauling supplies to the front. I've spent countless hours hunched in the drivers seat of a tank, waiting to be graced by the light of day and the order to drive forth and push the enemy back. I've watched from the trenches as a dozen men are slaughtered by a well placed artillery blast, and I'd do it all again."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"TLDR: NOT recommended to solo players.

The game is brilliant; it's a great mix between real time strategy, top-down shooters and mmo persistent elements.

I'm not recommending this game to solo players though. The overall community is friendly, but a few rotten apples can really ruin your fun. The game is NOT solo player-friendly. ""Clan man bad"", is a meme in this game, and it rings very much truth. 

I knew this in advance as the game presents itself as a collaborative war effort; so I decided to play collaboratively - focusing on the most ingrate tasks (building & logistics). My experience left me with a bitter aftertaste: toxic behaviour, memes, constant complaining & bashing on the devs, and selfish clans wore me down in the end, so I'm leaving this with a negative judgement.

To the community still playing: most of you are great, but please be more mindful/caring for your solo players - especially the ones doing some of the heavy lifting."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,Pretty fun game. If you like the concept of being a cog in a war fighting tooth and nail for victory over a large scale map i think you'll like this
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"There's a role for everyone because everything is done and made by players. Get lost in the sauce and have a chill time building and gathering or go to the front line and try to even survive. 
Deep strike into enemy territory if that's more your style, disrupt their supply lines and blow up whatever you can, or be a medic, a combat engineer, a base builder, a transport guy, make friends with local comms, etc.

Great game."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Squads/Regiments/Clans, & players in general are pretty toxic. Will mass report you for your team efforts. Given how abused the reporting system is, I can not recommend the game no matter how good or bad it is. This is just unacceptable even at the price it is being sold. 

What did I do? I borrowed concrete to upgrade structures near the front line. 
So beware of the toxic 'Dogz' clan, among many other mass reports I have seen by other people/clans to other players just trying to enjoy the game, they will just straight up mass false report you for helping your team. The worst false report I heard was a guy reported & banned by the abusive report system just for placing a sandbag where someone did not want it to be. 

Just, I can not recommend this game with this report system in mind, you are better off putting your money elsewhere & playing something such as Company of Heroes instead of this game, you do not want to be around toxic players that ruin the community as a whole. The game is supposed to be fun & they take that away from you by abusing the reporting system. All I ever see is endless chatter of users being reported & banned for doing little to nothing, yet people board that abusive train & I unfortunately too was a victim & it really just makes me wonder why I paid for this game for this sort of abusive behavior to happen.

Edit: Thinking on it, I would have never purchased the game, or would have refunded it within the time frame, if I knew this was an extremely huge issue in the game. If you read the reviews before purchasing the game, I highly recommend you check out other games instead, similar ones such as the mentioned above Company of Heroes. You are better off using your money on a product that does not have such a flaw established within it. I know it is Early Access, but this is just blatantly unacceptable.

Seriously, read the negative reviews, I am not the only one who is victim to this, many others are too. The report system will genuinely hinder your experience. It has been going on for far too long & it just isn't worth your money."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"[TL;DR]
Game good! 

In Foxhole you will: 
Die from Bullets
Die from Shells
Die from Friendly Fire
Die from standing in front of a mortar
Die from being run over by a friendly truck
Die from being run over by a enemy vehicle
Die from Bayonet Charge
Die from Arty
Die from Gas
Die from Nades
Die from being shot in the back, while carrying too much. 
Die from drowning
Die from standing in front of an Anti Tank gun
Die from laughing your ass off

[in no particular order]

After 3 years, I returned to Foxhole to be amazed how it has changed in a very positive way. 

From playing a couple of hours and visiting different theaters of war, I firmly can conclude that Foxhole has reignited my attention.

I spent four hours fighting on a bridge and doing some Logi , which it seems boring, when in reality, it was actually really enjoyable experience. 

It seems that communication has improved a lot, although I do not like being not able to see Squad Members on the Map, or at least an indicator.

(while the colonials get a M6A1 hvy tank, the wardens get a hetzer(no turret)). also someone tell the devs that tanks without any mg is not a tank by defenition but a tank destroyer. there is nothing to balance the number of active players, and the wardens are bleedding players rn, because of several consecutive defeats , even if wardens claim to have won more wars since launch. i bet that will change very wuickly with the current meta. also the game is riddled with alts, players actively working against their own faction. i had the pleasure of seeing on e of them in action and we lost our position in the following hour. idk if the devs do anything about it. speaking of balance i dont think there is any. the devs seem to focus on balancing the victories and not the equipement. at some poit you spawn in 30secs, the next you spanw in 1m30 because reasons. this game needs some refinement from the devs. balance in players and equipment, but mostly players. i dont mind equipement inbalance that much unless it is clearly in favor of one faction and this is the case here. tip : you want to win? dont join the wardens they dont win in the current meta."

The balance is absolutely terrible, the devs are arrogant, and the game is subpar."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Can't recommend it. It's a buggy, awful mess that's somehow only gotten worse with every single update these devs bother to push out.

Desyncing just seems to get worse and worse as you now have to start leading your hitscan weapons, bullets seem to vanish instead if hitting the enemy, bayoneting seems to get more unresponsive with each passing day as the game demands you to be within kissing distance of whoever you're trying to stab. Close quarters is a joke as your bullets simply go wherever they feel like, and usually it's away from the enemy. Shadow-dancing and run and gunning ruin whatever atmosphere and tone the game is trying to set, as there's nothing better than to get 360 quickscoped by a man running up a hill. Lag is frequent, high-ground is unbeatable, factions get access to different weapons and vehicles, meaning stealing, making alt accounts and sabotaging the enemy is needed to even the odds. 

I know I have 900+ hours on this game, but it's hard to justify buying this game when all you get is bad controls, bad camera, visual bugs, bad netcode, that have somehow never been addressed or fixed through the years as the devs are too focused on adding new content to keep player interest. With the numbers going down each day, and people leaving in rows as factions become more and more imbalanced the further into late-game we go. It's hard to recommend a game when the only times I had fun with it was when I was goofing off, going for bayonet charges and punching people in trenches. 

The main gameplay loop is so incredibly weak and unfun, you're better off grabbing whatever weapon interest you, and doing whatever you want, as a group of people will very easily fall into chaos by the sight of a single field-gun or mortar. Teamplay is recommended but not necessary, as people will often just ignore tactics and strategies. Mainly due to the awful way the game rewards such deeds, letting the players give out ranks and commends among themselves. And when buggy AI shooting and unforgiving lag is always in the way, there's little to do than to follow the highest rank in the fight and just hope he knows what he's doing.

The tutorial is a joke, unfun, and barely covers the basic aspects of the game. I've seen Sgt ranks running around with a wounded solider, frantically asking how they drop them for the medics to revive, along with dumb decisions like running in with a mounted cannon, with no knowledge of how it works or functions, only to get pounded by a firing squad. After 900 hours, I'm still even struggling to figure out the tank balance and how high-ground continues to make the game unplayable.

I can't with a full heart recommend this game on the grounds that it's quantity over quality. Instead of fixing the map, overpowered vaulting into high places or the buggy game mechanics, they continue to add boring, horrible guns that become so obsolete by late-game, there is simply no reason to produce or use them. Tanks and armor dominate the fields, making the job of infantry without anti-armor support a chore to do and have fun with. Bridges still haven't been fixed as bottlenecks are frequent, only being able to be broken by a strong tank push or artillery. I've now been playing for a better part of four years and I'm still struggling to see the fun aspect of this game. I've seen updates remove and add new things no one asked for and no one uses, yet they continue to add bad burst rifles which don't have a place in the battlefield, and with each faction getting a different roster of weapons, one will always come out on top in most situations. 

Do yourself a favor, and don't get into this game."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,dev bias is best bias. collies get all the tools meanwhile wardens get jack. Never seen a wargaming game so horrendously assassinated. This game is dead and the devs are happily pissing on the grave
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"This game is good by his concept, but the problem is that it's badly balanced.

-Positive side :

The community. Everyone is friendly towards each other, even with enemies sometimes (respect and stuff). Even if you're new you can ask anyone to teach you how the game works and they'll help you.

The game may seem hard to understand but there is basic tutorials on the camp's home region, you can also ask for guidance in game.

The game is fun, many gameplay styles such as building, logistics, frontline, artillery, partisan (going behind enemy lines to sabotage stuff), tanks, naval (naval update when ?).

Communication. There are many tools to communicate with the team with different purposes. Also a regiment system allowing you to play with a specific group for great operations.

The game is often updated.

-Negative side :
Even tho the devs knows the issues, they keep adding more content instead of fixing the existing ones, causing more imbalance.

Nothing is done against alt accounts that sabotages both teams. (using a 2nd account, log it in your enemy side and ruins everything unfairly)

When a team is winning too fast, the devs steps in and handicaps it for more longer than needed, causing the ""winners"" to lose.

Most asian playerbase is playing Colonials, causing the Wardens to get overwhelmed during night time EVERYDAY. Ruining a day of ""fair"" work.

If you can't accept defeat, don't buy this game.

I don't feel like the devs listen to the players's feedback and suggestions.


Conclusion : 

Foxhole is an unique game by it's genre and will give you many hours of fun with your team, only to be forgotten by the amount of problems there is. If you're a determined person, buy this game.
At the current state I don't recommend it for any other kind of player."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Game's tutorial is a mess, sprawled over an area with no real progression from one part of the tutorial to the next.  No real tutorial on certain mechanics.  The base gameplay is fine, but for a new player like me, no one wanted me to join them BECAUSE I am new, thus making the game basically unplayable as anything other than a bullet sponge due to lack of allies and being unable to actually do anything other than logistics.  And I refuse to be pigeon-holed into being just a ferryman for supplies all the time.  And before anyone asks, I did try to talk to people in the game and for every one nice player I had to deal with about eight or nine toxic players."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"I'm sincerely trying to find the good in this game, but so far it's unrewarding and nonsensical.

The aiming system makes NO sense (I know to wait, crouch, prone, etc--I still haven't HIT a single fucking person in 10 hours of playing), no one gives commendations to you unless you're in their clan, the clans are straight up bullies, and the griefing in the game by both sides is astounding (getting killed in my spawn by teammates, enemies parking barges under bridges to block them).

I see a potentially fun game in here, but it's hidden under a toxic community, some seriously deficient grinding mechanics, and a cumbersome and unintuitive combat system where aiming is whack-a-doodle and turning while prone is done in slow-motion."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"This game has great potential and I would like to see it succeed but after nearly 400 hours of play time and several wars I can not in good conscience recommend the game in it's current state, although I wish I could.

There's simply far too many balance issues the developers don't seem to take very seriously and move very slowly to fix but by far the biggest issue the game has is the ability for literally one person with too much time and too much money to ruin entire wars for everyone by simply buying multiple accounts. Do they ban people if they get caught? Sometimes, sure, but it's not a solution to the actual problem and now they want to increase the price of the game in the near future? That's fucked up because they have no incentive to fix the actual issue which is the way the tech in the game works and people cheating makes them money and them making money off people who cheat gives them no incentive to fix it.

For example, you could buy and create a fresh account, join the opposing faction and just run around to the engineering centers, public refineries and public stockpiles and collect any of the tech materials that may be sitting there, grab them, and go drop them in a bush somewhere or in water which literally ruins the game for everyone but more so the faction it's being done to. People complain about it, report the person, the devs usually EVENTUALLY ban them but it doesn't solve anything because that person, if they have the money and devotion to being an asshat, can just rinse and repeat the process, but there's always several people doing it, on both sides, every war and it's simply not fun and dumb.

I also don't like how they manually change the tech trees between each war to however they see fit. I would much rather have both sides get the same static trees every war that allow the ability to tech whatever is possible for each faction and let the players decide what they want teched to use without the interference of devs because honestly they kinda suck at creating fair and balanced options.

For me personally those are the 2 most game breaking factors that make it not fun and make me unable to recommend it, but there are more. The stealing/cheating isn't limited to just tech materials, but literally anything that's not in a private stockpile. They can steal and destroy any vehicle that's just chilling or go to any bunker base and just withdraw and destroy any equipment sitting in them but the tech stealing/cheating has the greatest overall impact in my opinion.

I also don't enjoy anything in the game combat related and spend the time I do playing just doing logistical stuff because I absolutely hate that if you want to be effective and have an advantage you have to literally downgrade your aspect ratio to 4:3 and you just look and aim at the very corner of your screen.

The building in the game needs serious attention as well. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about it because it doesn't much matter until the other stuff is fixed, but I'll just say it's boring and tedious as fuck and I'm surprised that even a few people enjoy doing it but not surprised that there's always a ton of undefended areas across the entire map on both sides because it's simply not fun or enjoyable at all to the point it's not even worth learning how to do because it's just a chore.

1.) Fix the alt/cheating problem by reworking the entire tech system so it's not possible for 1 dedicated person to ruin the entire game let alone several people, and so that the devs don't profit from cheaters.

2.) Stop making up tech trees each war. Create and settle on static tech trees that provide the option for players to tech into what they want instead of adding/removing different weapons & vehicles every other war. It's dumb and it literally takes away content that we paid for.

3.) Change the way the camera works so combat is actually fun and fair. I don't like how if you move your mouse to the edge of the screen it extends your vision range. I think locking the screen in place like Diablo or Path of Exile would make combat feel more fair and fun with the exception of using binoculars, because you can't fire a weapon while using them anyway.

4.) Building needs serious attention. It's boring, a chore and not intuitive at all.

I recommend NOT buying the game until 1 & 2 are resolved because they majorly impact the game in a negative way, especially if they plan to increase the price of the game without resolving those issues. 

#3 is debatable and more of a personal preference thing I suppose, but as it stands I don't enjoy the combat and it leaves me perplexed on how others do.

#4 is irrelevant until 1 & 2 are fixed but building sucks.

Minor things that's aren't game breaking but would be very nice and welcomed quality of life changes would be more customization of regiments and squads and the ability to mark and draw out operation plans in game instead of having to take screenshots, edit them and use things like discord to set stuff up as well as the ability to regiment lock stuff as well as squad lock and include that locking ability to bunkers. 

 It would also be nice to be able to customize the chat box size, position, font, ability to create our own chat rooms ect. Think of World of Warcraft chat and put it in Foxhole and that would resolve that."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Good stuff first. There's nothing like this game. The experience is truly unique at its best and this game has some of the best player interactions I've experienced. While it isn't for everyone, it feels really good to be one person in a sea of hundreds in one large battle.

However. This game has been greatly damaged by feature creep. The game now has asymmetric technology which means teams get different weapons and vehicles. This sounds fine in theory. But in practice it is hard to balance and the devs do not seem capable of balancing. You will see faction specific technology give one side a serious advantage resulting in several IRL days worth of unbearable gameplay before the roles switch and the other side gets stomped. This make the game annoying to play half the time and then pointless feeling the other half.

The game also sees devs meddling to prolong wars. This recent war, the devs added a 50 second respawn timer when we were making good progress. Then when we made another successful push, the devs added a 60 second respawn and kept it for 2 days until we were pushed back, even keeping it during low population. This killed any enthusiasm I had. It's clear the devs have ways to nudge the war in a direction they want, removing agency from the players.

I'd say keep your eye on this one if you're interested. Wait a year or two and take the criticism seriously. Even if you purchase now and enjoy it, you may find the devs change everything you liked about it."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"I've driven many miles hauling supplies to the front. I've spent countless hours hunched in the drivers seat of a tank, waiting to be graced by the light of day and the order to drive forth and push the enemy back. I've watched from the trenches as a dozen men are slaughtered by a well placed artillery blast, and I'd do it all again."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"TLDR: NOT recommended to solo players.

The game is brilliant; it's a great mix between real time strategy, top-down shooters and mmo persistent elements.

I'm not recommending this game to solo players though. The overall community is friendly, but a few rotten apples can really ruin your fun. The game is NOT solo player-friendly. ""Clan man bad"", is a meme in this game, and it rings very much truth. 

I knew this in advance as the game presents itself as a collaborative war effort; so I decided to play collaboratively - focusing on the most ingrate tasks (building & logistics). My experience left me with a bitter aftertaste: toxic behaviour, memes, constant complaining & bashing on the devs, and selfish clans wore me down in the end, so I'm leaving this with a negative judgement.

To the community still playing: most of you are great, but please be more mindful/caring for your solo players - especially the ones doing some of the heavy lifting."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,Pretty fun game. If you like the concept of being a cog in a war fighting tooth and nail for victory over a large scale map i think you'll like this
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"There's a role for everyone because everything is done and made by players. Get lost in the sauce and have a chill time building and gathering or go to the front line and try to even survive. 
Deep strike into enemy territory if that's more your style, disrupt their supply lines and blow up whatever you can, or be a medic, a combat engineer, a base builder, a transport guy, make friends with local comms, etc.

Great game."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Squads/Regiments/Clans, & players in general are pretty toxic. Will mass report you for your team efforts. Given how abused the reporting system is, I can not recommend the game no matter how good or bad it is. This is just unacceptable even at the price it is being sold. 

What did I do? I borrowed concrete to upgrade structures near the front line. 
So beware of the toxic 'Dogz' clan, among many other mass reports I have seen by other people/clans to other players just trying to enjoy the game, they will just straight up mass false report you for helping your team. The worst false report I heard was a guy reported & banned by the abusive report system just for placing a sandbag where someone did not want it to be. 

Just, I can not recommend this game with this report system in mind, you are better off putting your money elsewhere & playing something such as Company of Heroes instead of this game, you do not want to be around toxic players that ruin the community as a whole. The game is supposed to be fun & they take that away from you by abusing the reporting system. All I ever see is endless chatter of users being reported & banned for doing little to nothing, yet people board that abusive train & I unfortunately too was a victim & it really just makes me wonder why I paid for this game for this sort of abusive behavior to happen.

Edit: Thinking on it, I would have never purchased the game, or would have refunded it within the time frame, if I knew this was an extremely huge issue in the game. If you read the reviews before purchasing the game, I highly recommend you check out other games instead, similar ones such as the mentioned above Company of Heroes. You are better off using your money on a product that does not have such a flaw established within it. I know it is Early Access, but this is just blatantly unacceptable.

Seriously, read the negative reviews, I am not the only one who is victim to this, many others are too. The report system will genuinely hinder your experience. It has been going on for far too long & it just isn't worth your money."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"[TL;DR]
Game good! 

In Foxhole you will: 
Die from Bullets
Die from Shells
Die from Friendly Fire
Die from standing in front of a mortar
Die from being run over by a friendly truck
Die from being run over by a enemy vehicle
Die from Bayonet Charge
Die from Arty
Die from Gas
Die from Nades
Die from being shot in the back, while carrying too much. 
Die from drowning
Die from standing in front of an Anti Tank gun
Die from laughing your ass off

[in no particular order]

After 3 years, I returned to Foxhole to be amazed how it has changed in a very positive way. 

From playing a couple of hours and visiting different theaters of war, I firmly can conclude that Foxhole has reignited my attention.

I spent four hours fighting on a bridge and doing some Logi , which it seems boring, when in reality, it was actually really enjoyable experience. 

It seems that communication has improved a lot, although I do not like being not able to see Squad Members on the Map, or at least an indicator. This lead to a couple of frustrating moments, because as a Squad Lead there is no way to see where your squad members are??? But members see the leaders position...  I don't get that design choice, but oh well. Some glitchyness is still happening here and there, so be warned."

I've seen Sgt ranks running around with a wounded solider, frantically asking how they drop them for the medics to revive, along with dumb decisions like running in with a mounted cannon, with no knowledge of how it works or functions, only to get pounded by a firing squad. After 900 hours, I'm still even struggling to figure out the tank balance and how high-ground continues to make the game unplayable.

I can't with a full heart recommend this game on the grounds that it's quantity over quality. Instead of fixing the map, overpowered vaulting into high places or the buggy game mechanics, they continue to add boring, horrible guns that become so obsolete by late-game, there is simply no reason to produce or use them. Tanks and armor dominate the fields, making the job of infantry without anti-armor support a chore to do and have fun with. Bridges still haven't been fixed as bottlenecks are frequent, only being able to be broken by a strong tank push or artillery. I've now been playing for a better part of four years and I'm still struggling to see the fun aspect of this game. I've seen updates remove and add new things no one asked for and no one uses, yet they continue to add bad burst rifles which don't have a place in the battlefield, and with each faction getting a different roster of weapons, one will always come out on top in most situations. 

Do yourself a favor, and don't get into this game."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,dev bias is best bias. collies get all the tools meanwhile wardens get jack. Never seen a wargaming game so horrendously assassinated. This game is dead and the devs are happily pissing on the grave
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"This game is good by his concept, but the problem is that it's badly balanced.

-Positive side :

The community. Everyone is friendly towards each other, even with enemies sometimes (respect and stuff). Even if you're new you can ask anyone to teach you how the game works and they'll help you.

The game may seem hard to understand but there is basic tutorials on the camp's home region, you can also ask for guidance in game.

The game is fun, many gameplay styles such as building, logistics, frontline, artillery, partisan (going behind enemy lines to sabotage stuff), tanks, naval (naval update when ?).

Communication. There are many tools to communicate with the team with different purposes. Also a regiment system allowing you to play with a specific group for great operations.

The game is often updated.

-Negative side :
Even tho the devs knows the issues, they keep adding more content instead of fixing the existing ones, causing more imbalance.

Nothing is done against alt accounts that sabotages both teams. (using a 2nd account, log it in your enemy side and ruins everything unfairly)

When a team is winning too fast, the devs steps in and handicaps it for more longer than needed, causing the ""winners"" to lose.

Most asian playerbase is playing Colonials, causing the Wardens to get overwhelmed during night time EVERYDAY. Ruining a day of ""fair"" work.

If you can't accept defeat, don't buy this game.

I don't feel like the devs listen to the players's feedback and suggestions.


Conclusion : 

Foxhole is an unique game by it's genre and will give you many hours of fun with your team, only to be forgotten by the amount of problems there is. If you're a determined person, buy this game.
At the current state I don't recommend it for any other kind of player."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"Game's tutorial is a mess, sprawled over an area with no real progression from one part of the tutorial to the next.  No real tutorial on certain mechanics.  The base gameplay is fine, but for a new player like me, no one wanted me to join them BECAUSE I am new, thus making the game basically unplayable as anything other than a bullet sponge due to lack of allies and being unable to actually do anything other than logistics.  And I refuse to be pigeon-holed into being just a ferryman for supplies all the time.  And before anyone asks, I did try to talk to people in the game and for every one nice player I had to deal with about eight or nine toxic players."
Foxhole,Massively%20Multiplayer,505460,"I'm sincerely trying to find the good in this game, but so far it's unrewarding and nonsensical.

The aiming system makes NO sense (I know to wait, crouch, prone, etc--I still haven't HIT a single fucking person in 10 hours of playing), no one gives commendations to you unless you're in their clan, the clans are straight up bullies, and the griefing in the game by both sides is astounding (getting killed in my spawn by teammates, enemies parking barges under bridges to block them).

I see a potentially fun game in here, but it's hidden under a toxic community, some seriously deficient grinding mechanics, and a cumbersome and unintuitive combat system where aiming is whack-a-doodle and turning while prone is done in slow-motion."

Y e s.

I highly recommend this game."
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"Shakes and Fidget is a free to play animated web browser RPG with asynchronous multiplayer and everything RNG.  It is an international web browser and mobile game, so it will be populated with many other players. This game is translated into many languages, so there will be many Non-English reading players.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok, was understandable.  It is light on resources used, so it will be runnable on any computer.

Has funny quest text and gear descriptions.  The artwork is cartoony and funny. Has varied weapon sounds. Has some animation.  Has a manual and official wiki in English.  Pretty Easy to play.  

The level cap is 600, but it will take you long time to reach it, very TIME consuming game.  (At my current hours, i have a 144 scout and 135 warrior)  Quests and other things take an amount of real time to complete or cooldown reset.  More time you put into it, the higher you climb on the leaderboard.

Mushrooms are the store currency, but you can earn some from quests rewards and gambling.   Some gear cost mushrooms, but you might find the same and better later for gold only or quest reward.   You can spend mushrooms to skip waiting on timers or add time to questing endurance and the best mount.   There is hourglasses that you can buy with gold for skipping the travel time on questing.

It has PVP and PVE.  It is RNG combat where better stats and gear will give you some edge, but RNG is a fickle goddess, you still can lose to bad rolls. Difference in Level between you and target is a factor of success. You can make 2 characters per accont, picking one of 4 classes ( warrior, mage, scout, assassin).  Has an PVP Arena where you have a choice of 3 players to attack for gold, honor and xp.

You can raise your all your stats with gold and use potions to temporary improve a stat.   Gear you can buy or get from quests can now be modded in the blacksmith shop and in the tavern watercloset. At level 75, you can collect Pets that improve your stats and you can fight other players pets. There are many other things that you can do to improve your stats.  

It has 31 dungeons you can unlock and raid.    Finishing Frost Blood Temple Dungeon, you unlock The Tower which gives you three companions (Mage, Scout, Warrior) to raid with through 15 harder dungeons that unlock with the Tower.  You have to outfit your three companions with gear to improve their stats.  But ends up having to wait for your level to catch up to the dungeon level.

You can make your own fortress, with some buildings that improve your character and other building for protecting your fort or raiding others forts.  You can raid other players forts for resources and pour your gold in to defending your fort.  There is an Underworld that you can build and other players can raid. It has Guilds and guild wars, where guild members all attack other guilds or defend from other guild's attacks.  Guilds have stuff they can build that increases gold and xp gain for guild members.  But above level 25 guild upgrades require someone that Buys mushrooms.  You can increase your guild level also by completing guild house raids. 

The 22 plus servers are located in Europe somewhere (Central Europe time zone).  Devs keep adding more servers, which pulls active players from the established servers.  Leading a guild is easy but hard to get enough active dedicated players to reach the very top of the guild leaderboard.    

Try it, maybe you might like it.  You can play this game for free, and it keeps you busy several hours a day.

Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"[h1]Intro[/h1]
Played this for about 7 years now.

This is like a diablo game without having to do the grinding manually.

Instead, you send out your character on a quest using your limited energy per day, have the game running in the background and when it's done, you collect your xp/gold/whatever else dropped. Even the battles (there's one at the end of each quest for example) are automated and you can choose to skip them (they are decided by stats and some randomness - blocking, dodging, critical attacks, damage ranges etc.).

[h1]Warning[/h1]
This game is pay to win. But at the same time, I'm actually not bothered by this. Let me explain. In this game, there is a currency called mushrooms. You can actually get these randomly for free, but not enough to buy all the extra energy you can each day. More energy means you can do more quests and if you can do more quests per day, you will level up and increase your attributes faster. But you also have to put more time into it. The energy you are given is enough to take a couple hours each day (of course, again, mostly having the game running in the background while doing something else), so even if I could, I definitely wouldn't spend more time than that every day. That would just burn me out.

Also, the progression of others might as well be irrelevant to you if you're not too bothered about leaderboards. There are plenty of other things to do in this game other than straight up pvp.

The other uses of mushrooms aren't all that important and don't really give much of an edge in pvp.

As a last note, there is a special ""donatable"" version of mushrooms, which are needed to donate to a guild. There didn't use to be, but now there is a way to get these for free as well (though the regular drops don't count). I would assume (seeing as I have over 360 of these myself), that if everyone in a guild chips in with these, this isn't an issue at all.

[h1]Notable pros[/h1]
+ Over the years, the game received and continues to receive big updates. I'm talking entirely new features that add more and more layers of what you can actually do in this game, like the fortress (building a base, attacking other people's bases = new leaderboard entirely), pets (which you have to find first, you level them up and use to fight other people's pets), etc. Usually I'm just content doing my grinding and progressing dungeons and other stuff, but whenever one of these is announced, I'm legitimately excited.

+ You can play it on your phone (using your PC account), so that you don't miss your day's grinding if you're away or something. Or there's also the browser version, which came originally, for when you don't want your friends to know you play this and stop talking to you (jk).

+ No limits. Technically, there is a level cap (500), but I don't think anyone in the world hit that yet and it could get increased like it did once (I play on one of the oldest servers). You can increase your stats for gold to infinity, get better equipment, gems, etc. Basically, there really isn't an endgame to this. The dungeons and bosses in these are static, not randomly generated btw. and I think nobody has beaten them all yet. There's always some next challange you're looking to beat.

[h1]Notable cons[/h1]
- P2W (see Warning section for more explanation) - you're gonna hit that top 10 pvp leaderboard only if you have more money and time than god. Even if you don't care about that, you're going to progress dungeons slower.

- This game is repetitive. Duh. Like every game about grinding. You're gonna do your set of daily chores (and by now there's a lot, but you can do them simultaneously - while questing, spin that wheel of fortune, get those arena and pet battles done etc.) and then usually be glad that's done."
Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"Seeing the game has rather positive ratings I decided to look into. After spending almost hour I still have no idea where is the game.

Second of all if you run out of the ""thist for adventure meter"", which allows you to do quest, it does NOT regen on it's own..you HAVE to spend thier ""mushroom"" currency to refill it.. if you run out of mushrooms and exaust your questing meter and do not want to pay $ for mushrooms to play the game, it is literally done for you.

Shakes and Fidget,Massively%20Multiplayer,438040,"A fun, addictive web browser type game for people who like sense of constant progression towards a irelevant goal, boot the game, select an action, close the game, return later on, you've progressed and/or get something out of said action,rinse and repeat, it rewards you for tedious things but that's not always something bad, it's something i quite enjoy in these games."

FINAL FANTASY® XI: Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition,Massively%20Multiplayer,230330,"Don't let my steam hours fool you. I have 1797 days, 7 hours and 40 minutes of play time.
This game is still to this day receiving updates. The End game on this game is nothing like i've ever played in my life.
If you want to lose your soul and life time playing this, i highly recommend."
FINAL FANTASY® XI: Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition,Massively%20Multiplayer,230330,"            I just want to start off saying I have never played this game before, nor did I ever know of it's existence until recently. That being said I also have more hours than it shows, but the steam version only shows launcher time. Now this game is a real treasure in the sense that it checks all my boxes for an rpg game, with mmo elements. Something that i've wanted for a while, given how the current mmo genre is not my cup of tea at all. I love the exploration, the need to pay attention to quests, difficult overworld (Mmo's just don't care about making the overworld even remotely challenging anymore, really defeats the need to ever set foot in most of them), and the old school combat system. Normally i'd like a more quick action paced combat, but i feel the old school variant really allows for party cooperation/mechanics to mix in well, and fits the theme of the game overall better. That being said this game does require party elements to really survive, and I absolutely love that. Mmo's tend to not really need anyone to play with until you hit endgame instanced content (dungeons, raids, etc.) which in my opion defeats the whole purpose of having a massively multiplayer game. However don't worry, if being forced to find friends/strangers is not your cup of tea then you can just enlist npc's into your party as a link system. If you do like social interaction though, don't worry. This game isn't dead, and if you choose the right server you can find a great deal of ppl, and even starter zone ppl. I play on odin and i've found an endless amount of players.
            
           

              Now all that being said there are definitely some cons that could be deal breakers for some (Personally they barely phase me). One being the game does not hold your hand. It will not give quest markers, crafting ideas, or much description of a vast part of the game. This can require a great deal of wiki/player help to cover this (Very akin to an rpg called, ""Morrowind""). Also you will die often on your own, and it can take a while to get a variety of skills, and not just rely on auto attacks. Nothing hurts more than dying deep into exploration and not only losing xp (only after lvl 31), but also being sent all the way back to you last home point. Then there's the elephant in the room, yes the graphics are really dam dated. We're talking ps2 here, so temper those expectations. However the music being as old as it is, is quite soothing/wonderful. All in all if you want to play an rpg that suits that child like expectations of an mmo that you make friends, and go on dangerous adventures all over a mythical and engaging world, then this is your game.
                  

             Finally, actually playing the game can be a touch more tedious, but not as bad as most ppl make it out to be. First download game, and make a square enix account if you haven't. Then go to this link http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/index.shtml , and click on, ""square enix account management system"" at the top right. Log into your square enix account. Click on the final fantasy XI, and then click on, ""add new play online service account"". This will require the cd code from steam, that you can find if you press on the cog wheel (settings) for the game in your library. Now you'll notice while making the account some funky gmail, idk if you can, but to my knowledge you can't change that email. Don't worry though your SE account email will be linked to ffXI. Also make sure you take a picture of the password and such, or save the email that was sent with the info, just in case. So after you make the account go to options list and now you can go about changing your password and such. You will also have to make a character by clicking, ""add new options"" under the character part. This will also require your card info. If you got this off steam you do get 30 days free trial, but on the 20th day you'll get billed if you didn't  cancel it, also every character slot makes your subscription $1.00USD extra. Now that you're done with that go back to the accounts page, and here you can click on add a service account, and add the codes from steam that  give the choccobo outfit and the hat to get the rewards. After all that go to the game and launch it (If you closed it). It will say something on the lines of, ""update your play online account"" click it and log into your play online (the register option won't work). type in the info, and the member ID is something not made yet so don't freak out that you can't find it. Just type in what you want your play online member name to be. After which you'll log in and have your play online account, and the rest is pretty straight forward. Another piece of advice when launching the game from steam if you choose the bottom option of the three (the configure one) you can change the settings there. Make the game full screen if you want, and if you want a controller to work you do it through there. Also for controller make sure you check the xinput box to make all the button configures into the actual inputs/button names and not just numbers. I wish you all good luck, and if you bought the game I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"
FINAL FANTASY® XI: Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition,Massively%20Multiplayer,230330,"this game shows its age, in its subtle ways of lack of convenience features, its sometimes awkward conversations with NPCs, archaic map and controller options, but these are not deal breakers. these are not negatives. they just are. its has a higher learning curve, especially as someone whos never played an MMO but i have found enjoyment therein. its recommended that you read up some wikis, approach the community and ask questions to become familiar and learn about the game. once you do, its an enjoyable experience. i know it says ive only played about 30 minutes, but its more like 20 as of this writing. the steam game counter is busted.
do be aware that creating a playonline account and even starting the game is also a convoluted hassle, but is ultimately worth it. i would say FFXI is still worth it in 2021. even if only as a relic of a bygone age."
FINAL FANTASY® XI: Ultimate Collection Seekers Edition,Massively%20Multiplayer,230330,"I started playing XI for the first time about a year ago. It was one of the most immersive and enjoyable experiences I've had in years. That being said this game loves to be difficult for difficulty's sake. This game is FF's take on Ever Quest and once you understand that it becomes easier to take it as it is and just enjoy the experience. 

From here I'll break my review into 3 parts: Pro's, Stuff to Be Aware of, and Con's. I don't think of the StbAo section as a con's list but rather just some warnings about what to expect from a 20 y/o game so as to have clearer expectations. 

~*~*Pro's:~*~*
-Deep Progression Systems. You have your level for your class, stats you increase via use and at end game various stats you can further boost via point currencies earned in the place of EXP. 
-Large roster of playable classes from the Final Fantasy series. 
-Amazing music. 
-Meaningful loot. So many pieces of gear can be used to create sets tailored to whatever play-style you prefer.
-Immersive world with multi layer zones. I feel as if I'm always discovering something new in each zone I visit in this game.
-The story is good. Each expansion is it's own story-line and each one is good with memorable moments and characters. 

~*~*Stuff to Be Aware of:~*~*
-20 year old graphics. You can and you should mod the game using Ashenbubs HD's mod pack for the game. 
-You will need add-on's to make the game a more enjoyable play esp at end game. Windower is the big add-on manager for the game and makes it much easier to do. 
-Combat is slow. Most ppl will be used to things like WoW or Black Desert which have very snappy, fast combat. This is not fast. It's slow due to various mechanics built into it to make it better for creating synergies between various party members. 
-Everything is obscured. There are no quest markers, no indicators to point you in any direction, nothing. You will be using the wiki to figure everything out even so much as to how to unlock jobs. 

~*~*Cons:~*~*
-Real world timers. There are some parts of the game that have unlocks behind real world time gates. They're few but they exist and when you come across one they suck.
-Monthly subscription of $12 USD.  Do note that they do a Free Login Campaign every few months where you can play for usually a week to 2 weeks for free. While the game gets a monthly update I would say they're too small and Square Enix should just bundle the monthly fee with XIV's or get rid of it altogether."

However, the game is in development hell, it been in develop for five years now, but, it been sticking it's guns to it since the very start, it isn't a development team that left their game half-finished with broken promises. I will happily watch this game grow and be completed to it's very end and see the community for it strive.

I also went out of my way to get a model just for this game alone."

They haven't made nearly enough progress based on their promises, and even with the stuff they do release is usually very buggy. It's a fun experience with friends if you can catch it on sale, but once you play for about 20-30 hours the game starts to lack in content without grinding for very minuscule things.

I started playing on a laptop but it was super glitchy so I went to PC and its 100% better. I bought it for the golf and have rarely done the golf since there is soooo much good stuff to do in it. It's still in early access so there are some tweaks to be made but with all my early access games this one is the most updated.

       Transformice...what can I say about it... Well, you are a mouse. Which isn't that great, but the real amazing thing is that you chase after cheese all day.  Literally my biggest dream that I never told anyone. Some may make fun of me for the amount of time I played, but I say if I could chase after cheese in real life I would spend more than a few couple hundred hours on it. You know what makes it even better? It's free! Free Cheese! And you know everything free tastes better. It's hard for new people to like it because it's pretty difficult to be able to even get the cheese in the first place, but once you get that cheese, everything changes. You just want to get that cheese again and again. Life is going good; all the cheese you can get your little grubby little paws on. Then BOOM, it hits you, you realize it, you finally realize that the cheese you love is full of MSG and you can't stop even if you wanted to... It all spirals out of control at this point. Am I a mouse or human??? I don't even know anymore. I need to go get some more cheese. Yes, cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE!!!

[h1]The game.[/h1]
[i]Transformice[/i] is a 2D platform multiplayer game where you control a mouse who are trying to gather cheese and bring it back to the hole.

[h1]Gameplay.[/h1]
The gameplay is simple and the mechanics seems well-made. Graphically speaking, the game is simple and appealing.

You play as a mouse along with a bunch of other people and try to get the cheese with the help of the shaman, a special mouse that has powers that allow him to construct structures to help the mice get the cheese. You could also buy cosmetics with the cheese.

Theres a level up system that gives the shaman ridiculously overpowered abilities that allow them to single out people they like and complete the level for them and kill everyone else, which is usually what happens. Besides that, to this there is enough brony pandering to sink a ship, from cosmetics to maps based off the show.

The community isn’t very good, is really appalling, and now mostly consists of memelords and bronies. Each server is full of people saying “#@?* you” and “noob” and plenty of other insults.

Although this game doesn’t fascinate me (I confess), the game itself isn’t really bad. It's the community that makes this game not really fun to play. Looks like a bunch of kids of about 10 years old talking nothing but crap. Not recommended much because of the community. [u]If you play this with a couple of friends on a private server, I think it could become quite nice to play.[/u]

It's one of those ""An hour to learn/A lifetime to master"" kind of things.
The premace?  You and your mouse brothers and sisters (well, mainly just YOU!) need to get the cheese and get to the hole without plummeting to an undesirable death.
Against you are an assortment of traps, pitfalls, the other mice, and your own timing.
At first, it's a simple platformer, but the moves can get pretty advanced.  You can pull some really amazing stuns and leaps with proper timing and technique!
Additionally, during the platform maps, one mouse is the ""Shaman"" mouse, who has powers to build and place all kinds of nifty tools, platforms, spells, balloons~  all kinds of things to help all the mice get successfully to the cheese and back to the hole.  You level up your shaman too, learning new spells and tricks to get everyone from A-B.

One man heavy tanks so you can experience all the fun of driving into a ditch and then getting blown up by an enemy commander for not moving.

Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"Early Access (far from finished) MMO that now offers a QoL monthly subscription comparable in price to that of FFXIV, ESO, and WoW. Effectively now indie game or not with its current monetization model and price it is competing alongside those previously mentioned games while not being remotely in the same league.
 
This game was already incredibly niche, now potential new players are going to look at the price for entry and compare and contrast it with the genre giants. This change effectively gated off an already niche game community, pushing away potential new players for the ability to further monetize the niche community. 

If you are looking for a new MMO I can safely say to skip this game, while it has an interesting skill system it was arguably already overpriced at its base box price, the inclusion of a monthly subscription while still being early access says more about the game than I ever could."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"There is so, so much to like about Project: Gorgon. Unfortunately with all the good things, come equally bad things.

There are a ton of great ideas in the game, but great ideas don't thrive without good execution, and the execution in Project Gorgon is it's constant weakness. There isn't a single amount of polish in the game to be found. Every feature, ability, animation, dialogue line, icon, feels like a first iteration, and it adds up to ""death by a thousand cuts"". In it's attempt to stretch to typical MMO heights, the general world suffers. To paraphrase Bilbo Baggins, ""It feels like butter scraped across too much bread"".

I understand that this is a perpetual Early Access game, but the rough edges are egregious and they permeate every aspect of of the experience. It's typically explained away by the community with claims of the art being placeholder, and the fact it's a two person development team, or that there's no ""hand holding"".

And those are impressive feats, to even have an MMO running, but overall it's not quite enough. There's not a single system that doesn't feel riddled with bugs or general jank. While it does possess a certain amount of old school charm to it, it mostly feels like a crutch. And at the end of the day, those come across as excuses. Excuses for constant bugs in the most basic systems, excuses for horrendous performance, questionable animations, lack of a cohesive art style.

The game has a fantastic community, with the caveat of that fantastic community mainly exists within the game itself, and as long as you don't approach criticism of the game. Just look at new player posts on the forums, steam, or Reddit. You'll find established players blaming users for not knowing things that are obvious to someone with hundreds of hours in the game, yet the whole game is based around the concept of obscurity. 

The wiki says, ""hey this game is about exploration, don't look at the wiki"", but then folks are lambasted for not using the wiki. There's a certain air of Stockholm Syndrome and an air of a club who is ""in the know"". Understandable when folks spend thousands of hours in it's thousands of skills. Having thousands of skills is great, but if you don't know what the synergies are, how can you build a character and ""play how you want"", which is another one of it's claims.

That being said, there is fun to be had. There are unique systems to experiment with. There are cool ideas. I spent 45 hours in the demo, and another 40 since I bought the game, and I have definitely gotten that value from it.

Will I keep playing it? It's less and less everyday. I can feel my enthusiasm wane as the rough edges keep popping up to wear me down. Unlike say, the Souls series, I don't feel mastery emerging from the jank as I play, I just feel the flaws more and more. And that's why I can't recommend it at this point.

However, [b]I do recommend you grab the demo[/b], and do recommend you spend some quality time on the newbie island. You may be far more forgiving than me, and you may be able to find the diamond in the rough like a few hundred others have. 

And like many others in it's near decade long development, I will keep an eye on it, and hope it makes it to a better place where I can find that balance."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,The new VIP-system is not justified given the state of the game in early access (might never make it out of it!). Usually this indicates the end state of a game where the still remaining player base is milked dry before the game completely shuts down.
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"Project Gorgon is an MMORPG that should be perfect for me, given the developers having past experience with Asheron's Call -- my favorite MMORPG of all-time. When I purchased this a couple of years ago, I expected a modern take on the Asheron's Call formula, with a heavy focus on world exploration and lore. Unfortunately, this game fails to take it's lore too seriously, with lots of items with joke names and quests that are silly, and the world itself lacks the random, meaningful finds of AC.

It's not a terrible MMORPG and for someone seeking an old school MMORPG experience that's similar to EverQuest, this game might be a good choice. There are lots of skills to develop, plenty of areas to explore, and quite a bit of flexibility in how you approach the game.

For me personally, Project Gorgo ns a title that suffers from ""Black Desert Online syndrome"", where an MMORPG appears to offer the list of features that are important to me yet somehow the finalized project just isn't entertaining to me. Had it taken it's lore a bit more serious and structured the content more tightly as to feel more like it's connected in a meaningful way, it could at least have been a serviceable MMORPG for me. It ended up just being playable and mediocre for me, and one that I will potentially return to a few years in the future to see how it's progressed but definitely not one I'd recommend."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"This former unique game with promise has now turned in to an obtuse, unoptimized, P2W shell of its' original self by the devs.  Do not support these practices or the people behind them regardless of how much they throw the ""We're the little guys and we care about our players"" lie at you."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,Ya well new it was coming [VIP] they need to make money some how but like others have said the game runs like crap and looks like crap even on the latest hardware out or old hardware which says one thing they don't know what they are doing.  Hopefully their new hired help can save them and they know how optimize this game so it can at least play. Right now it is like a rubber-band game lagged the fuck out.  I mean if it was playable maybe people might want to subscribe until then I think it is unfair to introduce this system at least wait until you make the game work
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"Absolutely immersive game that I really want to see succeed. People are complaining about the optional vip subscription which gives you a few more inventory slots, character slots, and a small amount of rested xp. It is not pay to win like people are saying. There is no in game shop. If you want to play a pay to win game go play the numerous free to play mmos out there where they will actually force you to sub to get anywhere. The sub in this game is merely for those who want to continue to support the game's development very much like a patreon subscription. It's a small game run by two people. There are a lot of armchair quarterbacks complaining here. Don't listen to them."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"As much as I did enjoy it back in the day, I cannot -in good conscience- recommend this to anyone. 
The game was created to a niche audience, it had charm despite the overall quality. Really liked almost everything about it.
The addition of VIP was mentioned, I'll give them that (except it was nowhere on Steam, so if you didn't dig around beforehand; surprise!). 
To honestly think you can charge people this much for a game of this quality with an added subscription is ambitious, if anything. 

This decision of theirs while can be excused if it's a funding problem (which it isn't, they said so themselves), is extremely poor. Dividing your already small & niche playerbase is never a good move. Hope it goes well for them but for me? I'm out."

Still, we have many goals to fullfil and we hope for even more content in the future. I love it that there is a VIP membership now.

I spent another 30 hours trying to undo this change to no avail. I contacted the in game help, Zero help. they tell you you need a potion, but you're a cow now and can't make potions or talk to anyone, or use anything. LOL you're a cow now, and the 40 hours of fun gaming you had is lost. I started a new character after that, but soon fell into the thought that it would happen again.  I shut the game off and never bothered with it again. Its Sad really. great idea! Terrible mechanics and lack of clear instruction for almost anything quest related. :("
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"Just had to do my part to counter the little kiddies leaving negative reviews over the entirely harmless VIP system which doesn't in any way introduce even a shred of ""p2w"". Apparently no one even knows what that term means anymore.

Fantastic game though. One of the few good MMOs left. It's very unique and honestly deserves a much bigger playerbase than it has. Still you see plenty of people running about."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"I didn't really enjoy the game, but I didn't refund because I want to see if it'll improve over time.
Then they added a freakin' P2Win sub fee after charging honestly too much for this kinda jank game (currently, I hope it improves)
Because of that sub fee, I'm making this negative review.. will change once some actual updates come out and I give the game another try (every update is tiny and underwhelming currently and does little to fix the issues I experienced)."

I shut the game off and never bothered with it again. Its Sad really. great idea! Terrible mechanics and lack of clear instruction for almost anything quest related. :("
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"Just had to do my part to counter the little kiddies leaving negative reviews over the entirely harmless VIP system which doesn't in any way introduce even a shred of ""p2w"". Apparently no one even knows what that term means anymore.

Fantastic game though. One of the few good MMOs left. It's very unique and honestly deserves a much bigger playerbase than it has. Still you see plenty of people running about."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"I didn't really enjoy the game, but I didn't refund because I want to see if it'll improve over time.
Then they added a freakin' P2Win sub fee after charging honestly too much for this kinda jank game (currently, I hope it improves)
Because of that sub fee, I'm making this negative review.. will change once some actual updates come out and I give the game another try (every update is tiny and underwhelming currently and does little to fix the issues I experienced)."
Project: Gorgon,Massively%20Multiplayer,342940,"Yep its a great classic MMORPG, BUT riddles with bugs and just got P2W introduced as VIP subscription, Lots of players are leaving unfortunately."

Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,car go stututu
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"bro,, vrum vrum u feel me? is nice af tbh"
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"U want a honest review?

First let me start by saying i have played this sim/racing game on another account that i completely forgot about that has 1500hrs on it easily, sooo yea i have 4000hrs in this and yes i have played this since it first came out(i have time to kill im retired basically).

Lets talk about stock AC (Assetto Corsa) by today's standards, mind you this sim is almost 8yrs old 
 
8/10
-Plenty of cars and tracks to choose from so u can have fun at a nice price, goes on sell quite often (after you have setup your wheel and pedals properly or with controller or keyboard, AND get your FOV dialed in) 

-U can get good/great fps even on a somewhat dated pc until u decide to do something crazy like race on the Nordschleife with every ai u can possibly fit or try VR

-Graphics, well its age shows right there :whooze: 

-Physics, does just fine though some cars do feel extremely glued to the road or have broken aerodynamics or just drive like bricks ( so if u think ur going to just get in a Mclaren P1 and do some drifts like u seen on a few yt videos... well best of luck), but hey nothing is perfect especially something this old still does better than games like gts or pc2-3 imo
 
Now for the modded version of AC
 
MY GOD the modded community has done a number on this sim and for the better  

 10/10 ( if i get the right content )
-Between SOL(weather update), CSP (Custom Shaders Patch), CM (Content Manger), PPF (PostProcessingFilters) this sim looks like it belongs in a game trailer from this year, dont believe me? Just go inside the Screenshot channels of a DECENT AC discord server and look.

-There (i cant express this enough) are good and great mods and then there are bad and terrible mods be it tracks or cars etc, im not going to get into detail about because it would take forever to explain but to put it as short as possible there are some mods that look and drive worse than stock AC and there are mods that are just so much fun and everything feels natural u can get lost in this sim for hrs and hrs, just ask around in a DECENT AC discord server or go to RaceDepartment 

Yes i would recommend this sim to anyone that has a love/ passion for cars but try not get too involved with the some of community, odds are you'll end up in argument with kids or adults who should honestly get off and get a job."
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,Best sim racing game right now
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"Comunity of this game is something, realy something! 

If someone nees help with start in game just notice"
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,Very nice
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"Without proper gear, not worth it. Oh and didn't recognize two of my controller.(both xbox360, one cable other wireles)"
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,Turns out i cant drive for shit
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"The world isn't ready for the tyre physics. More playable on a keyboard than other driving simulators. A steering wheel & pedals makes it easier, and quality force-feedback makes it easier still.

You can't drive at full speed, tap brake, and steer like NFS. The game is about finding braking points, turn in point, smoothly braking & accelerating. Trail-braking works. It's difficult to find the braking & turn-in points with a small screen/non-VR, and it's difficult to know when the car is understeering without force-feedback. So it's difficult to go fast.

Nearly every sports car & track has been modded for the game to a high standard."
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"Seems like they spent all the time on the cars themselves, and no time anywhere else. Races feel bland and bare-bones, setting one up feels like a chore and it, just doesn't feel fun. Like at all."
Assetto Corsa,Simulation,244210,"Cruising down on the Wangan street with JDM cars for fun with the bois certainly made Assetto Corsa one of the greatest and enjoyable game with its wide mods support.

Assetto Corsa has an active modding community that still provides players with fresh content regularly. As with any mods, some are amazing whilst others are of questionable quality, but one thing’s for sure, you aren’t going to run out of new things to try any time soon. One mod I particularly enjoy adds an excellent recreation of the Wangan - C1 Street racing with JDM cars by Shutoko Revival Project 2.0, adding in the entire field of cars and their various liveries. It’s just one example of the fantastic work the Assetto Corsa community has produced.

These mods can add your favourite cars to the game or even just throw a new livery onto an existing favourite of yours. And with the game offering good support for mods, both for creators and players, you don’t need to worry about modding being too difficult to be accessible. The majority of mods are as simple as downloading the content then dragging and dropping the files into your game folder, meaning you can find a mod on a site like RaceDepartment and in a matter of minutes, be flying around the track in your new car.

So now you’ve heard me sing the game’s praises, I think it’s pretty obvious that I think Assetto Corsa is worth picking up in 2021. The driving experience it provides and the wealth of content available from the modding community give you an endlessly enjoyable game that you can sink hours into. And with Assetto Corsa Competizione focusing solely on GT racing rather than offering the variety of the original, much of what Assetto Corsa has to offer can’t be found in the newer release.


So whilst the Ultimate Edition may feel a tad pricey for a six-year-old game, it’s well worth picking up if sim-racing is something you enjoy or want to get into. Not to mention the fact that it goes on sale in nearly every Steam sale there is for more than half price. So with the Steam Summer Sale coming up this June you won’t even have to wait that long to grab it for a good price."

as i read in some other reviews the AI difficulty is a weird thing

""Give us some dynamic difficulty scaling. I dont want to have to alter the difficulty inbetween races because I either totally stomped on the entire race and beat them all by 40 secconds or I felt cheated when the AI blatently just accelerate past me in impossible ways because I set the difficulty too high."" - PervasivePeach⁧ ♡

I totally agree on what PervasivePeach ⁧⁧♡ says here, on 1 track i find winning the race with 20 seconds between me and the 2nd guy and the other race i find myself on the 16th place

another thing i don't like is that when another driver drives into me i sometimes get a penalty even though it was not my fault

that was about it for the negatives
i liked the my team and the career mode, having my own team but also driving for a team. 2 gamemodes i really like"

The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"I'm only 2 hours in and it feels like I've experienced all the interesting aspects of the game already. Worth $5 sure. Anything more than that, probably not.

Pros:
- your airplane can transform into a car and fall out of the sky
- they got rid of a lot of the story from the first Crew game and get you into the action arguably quicker
- gameplay is smoother than the original (fewer buggy connection issues)

Cons:
- there are still annoying cut scenes and a half baked story
- the world is not as memorable or interesting as the first game 
- the terrain and weather was a lot more interesting in the original
- there's not much to do outside of the key spots spread out over the map
- they got rid of the whole cops chasing you concept when you cause destruction (although it is less annoying when you're trying to do something)
- all of the cars feel the same (driving off road with a Miata feels nearly the same as an offroad dune buggy)
- exploration is boring compared to similar games

Recommend playing the original instead. If you don't like story, try Forza Horizon or Burnout Paradise. All of them are much more enjoyable and interesting to just drive around in the world, in addition to being more fun when you do get into the action."
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"game doesnt live up the hype.Ive played the game after reviewing so i can confidently say that the game has the alt tab bug,the keyboard controller switch bug and the random game crash bug.Graphic and Grindwise game looks good.Dont buy  the game unless it goes for like 6 bucks at max."
The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"Ok. I had a lot of fun cruising alone over the wide roads of the map. I also like the design and the sound of the vehicles some times. Game is not too buggy and you can do some races even with friends together.

But every single event is only there to generate even more revenue for the producers. The worst thing is that it's only about milking the remaining players dry, because you still have to pay for the new events to be able to collect the rewards at all. In addition, it is also very expensive. Even worse is once you have bought the ""access"", you have to fulfill certain orders so that you can get the rewards at all and the orders are boring to compete and only serve the players to stay in the game. It takes hoursssss to fullfill the orders. I just played 1hr (6 races) and I didn't get any reward through the leveling system from the event. The event also ends in like 39 days. I assume that I'm gonna lose the ability to get the rewards.
 
But look at that, you can also buy the orders with real money so you can get the rewards. Very original Ubis... Well done, I'm proud. Just like any other event which you released so far. These aren't rewards anymore, they're crappy expensive skins."

Descenders,Sports,681280,"i like this game , i enjoy this game,I will continue to play this game, but there's so many niggling issues stopping me from recommending it.
the rng in the level creation has given me an unwinnable scenario on a boss jump where it was simply impossible to get enough speed to clear this has happened multiple times. 
jumps feel like they're made of ice for some reason and love to shoot you off to side so minor corrections are very difficult to make last second.
 Pumping is such an integral skill to have and use in this game yet its rarely mentioned and there's almost no consistent way to practice this skill without mods, also its quite difficult to determine whether or not your pumping correctly since the game gives no indication besides a speed increase ( an audio que could somewhat fix this) and there's no real tutorial on doing it from what i have seen.
"
Descenders,Sports,681280,"It's really fun at first but then it just gets repetitive. The only thing that's fun about this game are the mods and bike parks, the career mode is bland and boring."

The custom parks are cool, although there are only a couple. 
The bikes are cool.

Cons:

The most generic, lifeless, uninspired, run of the mill soundtrack I have heard, it sounds like copyright free EDM / drum and bass that was all over 2012 youtube. 

The animations are stiff and super clunky.

You get one item at the end of a run, there are tons of cosmetics to unlock (Mainly just some clothes piece with a different color slapped on it. 

What procedural generation? The tracks feel the same EVERY SINGLE TIME. They all feel horrible, its super glitchy and awkward. You have to go fast to make a jump, but if you go too fast and a pebble is in the same galaxy as you, you are going to fall off. 

It feels like complete luck when you do good. I can't explain it, but it is not rewarding at all, and I avoid career mode as much as possible, but that is the only way to unlock cosmetics.

No communication. No voice chat, no text chat, no emotes, voice lines, nothing. 

Just buy steep or Session. This game is ass. 

TLDR: It sucks."

Descenders,Sports,681280,"[h1]Descenders tries to be many things but becomes nothing as a result[/h1]
It is a game simple in premise and execution, it is easy to pick up and get going but there is a lot to master as well and a high skill ceiling. However, due to lack of focus the game becomes a conflicted mess once you think about it.

[h2]Pros:[/h2]
[List]
[*][b]Excellent controls - [/b]Simple and effective, they are not too tight and not too loose. Steering is challenging at high speeds but not impossible.
[*][b]Sense of speed - [/b]I cannot remember any other game with such a great sense of speed. You accelerate quickly and moving fast is exhilarating. And when you are able to thread the needle it is so satisfying.
[*][b]Procedural generation - [/b]Basically an infinite amount of tracks. There is also a lot of variety because of it and the fact that there are 8 distinct biomes with different hazards and features.
[/List]

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
[List]
[*][b]It does not know what it wants from you - [/b]You start playing and naturally you follow the track downhill. Going as fast as possible towards the finish line is very fun. But soon you realize that you can go off track and ignore the preset track, and then you realize that there is no good incentive to go fast and that the best way to reach the goal reliably is to crawl down at a snail's pace. All that matters is that you do not crash, nothing else is important. I made it to the end just by slowly rolling downhill and pressing the breaks constantly. I think the idea is that there are many intended ways of playing e.g. going fast, doing stunts, drifting or going off-road. And by making all of those options viable that failed to make it worthwhile adhering to either style.
[*][b]Roughlike structure - [/b]Each run you make it through one or more maps of connected nodes that represent a track. They have different stats and modifiers but since going slow is the way to go, nothing matters. What playing risky can give you are extra lives and crewmembers. I might suck, but going for extra lives is often more risky than just ignoring the challenge and descent safely. Losing a life trying to gain one is a zero sum game at best. Crewmembers give extremely niche or minor bonuses that do not impact gameplay in any meaningful way. 
[*][b]Overworld map - [/b]There is no incentive to not just take the shortest path towards the map exit making the majority of each overworld map superfluous. Playing more maps are just more opportunities to mess up and lose lives. And apparently if you play too many maps the sun sets and you have to ride in the dark, but this NEVER happened to me and I never saw any reason to play more tracks than absolutely necessary.

Descenders,Sports,681280,"It's really fun at first but then it just gets repetitive. The only thing that's fun about this game are the mods and bike parks, the career mode is bland and boring."
Descenders,Sports,681280,really good game for grinding
Descenders,Sports,681280,catJAM
Descenders,Sports,681280,"i like this game , i enjoy this game,I will continue to play this game, but there's so many niggling issues stopping me from recommending it.
the rng in the level creation has given me an unwinnable scenario on a boss jump where it was simply impossible to get enough speed to clear this has happened multiple times. 
jumps feel like they're made of ice for some reason and love to shoot you off to side so minor corrections are very difficult to make last second.
 Pumping is such an integral skill to have and use in this game yet its rarely mentioned and there's almost no consistent way to practice this skill without mods, also its quite difficult to determine whether or not your pumping correctly since the game gives no indication besides a speed increase ( an audio que could somewhat fix this) and there's no real tutorial on doing it from what i have seen.

Descenders,Sports,681280,fun times m8
Descenders,Sports,681280,good
Descenders,Sports,681280,It's good.
Descenders,Sports,681280, I like this game a lot. The graphics are really good and  its very realistic
Descenders,Sports,681280,"Pros: 
The custom parks are cool, although there are only a couple. 
The bikes are cool.

Cons:

The most generic, lifeless, uninspired, run of the mill soundtrack I have heard, it sounds like copyright free EDM / drum and bass that was all over 2012 youtube. 

The animations are stiff and super clunky.

You get one item at the end of a run, there are tons of cosmetics to unlock (Mainly just some clothes piece with a different color slapped on it. 

What procedural generation? The tracks feel the same EVERY SINGLE TIME. They all feel horrible, its super glitchy and awkward. You have to go fast to make a jump, but if you go too fast and a pebble is in the same galaxy as you, you are going to fall off. 

It feels like complete luck when you do good. I can't explain it, but it is not rewarding at all, and I avoid career mode as much as possible, but that is the only way to unlock cosmetics.

No communication. No voice chat, no text chat, no emotes, voice lines, nothing. 

Just buy steep or Session. This game is ass. 

TLDR: It sucks."
Descenders,Sports,681280,"fun game just to chill and do tricks, definitely a learning curve, but very satisfying once you are skilled"
Descenders,Sports,681280,really good i love the graphics love it
Descenders,Sports,681280,"[h1]Descenders tries to be many things but becomes nothing as a result[/h1]
It is a game simple in premise and execution, it is easy to pick up and get going but there is a lot to master as well and a high skill ceiling. However, due to lack of focus the game becomes a conflicted mess once you think about it.

[h2]Pros:[/h2]
[List]
[*][b]Excellent controls - [/b]Simple and effective, they are not too tight and not too loose. Steering is challenging at high speeds but not impossible.
[*][b]Sense of speed - [/b]I cannot remember any other game with such a great sense of speed. You accelerate quickly and moving fast is exhilarating. And when you are able to thread the needle it is so satisfying.
[*][b]Procedural generation - [/b]Basically an infinite amount of tracks. There is also a lot of variety because of it and the fact that there are 8 distinct biomes with different hazards and features.
[/List]

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
[List]
[*][b]It does not know what it wants from you - [/b]You start playing and naturally you follow the track downhill. Going as fast as possible towards the finish line is very fun. But soon you realize that you can go off track and ignore the preset track, and then you realize that there is no good incentive to go fast and that the best way to reach the goal reliably is to crawl down at a snail's pace. All that matters is that you do not crash, nothing else is important. I made it to the end just by slowly rolling downhill and pressing the breaks constantly. I think the idea is that there are many intended ways of playing e.g. going fast, doing stunts, drifting or going off-road. And by making all of those options viable that failed to make it worthwhile adhering to either style.
[*][b]Roughlike structure - [/b]Each run you make it through one or more maps of connected nodes that represent a track. They have different stats and modifiers but since going slow is the way to go, nothing matters. What playing risky can give you are extra lives and crewmembers. I might suck, but going for extra lives is often more risky than just ignoring the challenge and descent safely. Losing a life trying to gain one is a zero sum game at best. Crewmembers give extremely niche or minor bonuses that do not impact gameplay in any meaningful way. 
[*][b]Overworld map - [/b]There is no incentive to not just take the shortest path towards the map exit making the majority of each overworld map superfluous. Playing more maps are just more opportunities to mess up and lose lives. And apparently if you play too many maps the sun sets and you have to ride in the dark, but this NEVER happened to me and I never saw any reason to play more tracks than absolutely necessary.

Forza Horizon 4,Racing,1293830,"[h1]Burnout, Need for Speed and Test Drive Unlimited had a threesome...[/h1]

FH4 is the best arcade racing game. It has a lot content, great selection of cars, fun gameplay, good controls and physics.

I'm extremely happy that Forza Horizon 4 is finally on Steam, I wanted to play this game for years. But xbox app was testing my patience.

It's an open world racing game. I guess by cranking up the difficulty and realism settings you could bring it closer to sim-cade level, but mostly it's arcade, a fun one, where laws of physics still exist and different cars handle differently.

A while ago when there were mainly arcade games on the market I always wanted more simulators or something arcade but which makes sense when it comes to handling. But then the age of simulators started. Sure they're fun, but they're tiring while Forza is relaxing in a way. Well, you can make it relaxing or challenging. It's the most fun racing game on the market.

Car handling is awesome. The weight transfer physics work which is especially useful in dirt racing, you can drift which requires some effort unlike in other games. It's just that awesome feeling, fun and slightly realistic.

Car selection is amazing. Everyone will find a car they adore. There are hundreds of cars, something like 700 maybe? Cars have classes and the selection is very diverse. From vintage cars to modern supercars, from regular road cars to rally cars or even trucks or vans. There are even Lego and hot Wheels cars. Just insane.
Maybe one downside is that you get a bunch of cars really quickly so there's no sense of progression because you're being given the fastest cars in the first hours of the game. I prefer starting with regular cars and make my way up to earn faster, more expensive cars. Fortunately you can choose whatever car in exhibition races but still it lack progression.

So you race in England. At first it's slightly confusing to drive on the wrong lane, of course you can drive however you like but still coming from other games like ETS2 it's a bit confusing, especially the roundabouts. Not in a bad way though.
The map is huge and very diverse. Highways, dirt roads, small roads, forests, mountains, lakes, city, everything you want is there for you to explore. And exploring is fun. There are hidden barns and other collectables. While barns are fun, they give you a new car but other collectables are just there for the sake of...collectables. But again – not a bad thing, some of them are fun to find. One of the fun collectable types are beauty spots. You see a beautiful cut-scene of the area/object.

The game revolves around competing in a festival. There are various challenges which give you rewards when you complete them. Most of the time you'll need to win races but there are other challenges, like speed traps where you must drive as fast as possible or the ones where you need to jump off a ramp and be in the air for as long as possible.
But of course racing is the most important here and you have few types of races. Circuit racing, point A to B racing. But that's not all. There A to B races where you need to follow the road and there are ones where you just need to get to finish line as quick as possible by driving wherever you like, no rules. Team racing where one team competes against drivatar team or other players. There are also races against trains or planes. On top of that there are taxi missions. Which bring us to story events. Those are events/races with some story to it. They're fun and challenging and will keep you occupied for a while.

Now multiplayer activities. Racing is obviously one of them but there's also capture the flag where you must carry the flag to destination and other team needs to stop you. Matches where infected team need to touch other cars to infect them. Protect the king matches which is similar. And the most surprising one – battle royale.
There's also ranked play. It has stricter rules like you can't hit the walls because you get penalized.

But it's not all multiplayer only. Amount of single player content is insane. You can choose to race solo on your chosen difficulty level, a coop race against drivatars and story missions.
The game basically gives you a choice how you want to play it.

You can customize your character and own a house, multiple houses which serve as your garage and home where you can tune your cars and your appearance.
You can also tune your cars accordingly to race you're going to participate. Don't want that? Just download the setup straight from the game. You can apply liveries to your cars by creating your own where the only limit is your imagination or just download a livery.
To get new stuff you spin a fortune wheel and rewards are ranging from money and clothes to some cool cars. You earn wheelspins by playing the game.

You can drive anywhere, hit bushes, smaller trees, rocks, fences – the environment is destructible. But the best part are seasons. There're four seasons which change over time. Each season has its challenges to compete for you. And season changes could even change your driving. On winter it could be harder to drive but lakes are frozen so you can have fun on the lake. Seasons along with dynamic weather change the map drastically.

This is one of the best looking games. Seasons change the map so much that it feels fresh each time. All the seasons are absolutely beautiful.
Cars look amazing and they're all are fully modelled. You can look closely at every part of the car.
Environments look great. Distant objects are lower quality but overall the game looks stunning.
There's also a photo mode where you can take beautiful pictures. But I find most filters pretty poor so it's better to tune the colors by yourself.

When the game looks that good I don't expect it to run smoothly. But this is probably the best performing game currently in my library. Runs on max graphics, 80-100fps, smooth as butter. I'm playing on 5800x, 2070s, 32GB @3440x1440.
There's native ultrawide support. Although cut-scenes are cropped for some reason.

It has a lot of loading screens so I suggest to install this to m.2 ssd. They're usually short, 3 to 15 seconds, but there are so many of them that it gets annoying. It's especially annoying in mp because everyone must wait until the slowest PC will load the game which could take 15 minutes. How fun is it to wait 15 minutes for a 5min race?
I noticed many people complaining about stuttering cut-scenes. But cut-scenes are actually loading screens.

One more minor annoying thing is unskippable voice when you open the map and there's something new on it. It tells you about new activities but after 20th time I just don't want to hear it anymore it's the most annoying thing in the whole game besides clueless online players.

Sound design is perfect. Cars sound great, the festival site feels alive.
There're radio stations so most people will find something to listen to but t lack a metal station.

Overall an extremely good racing game for anyone who at least slightly enjoys racing games. It's great for everyone's taste due to plenty of different activities and modes to play.
I suggest buying the ultimate edition. It only lacks two dlc's. Not at full price obviously.

[b]Pros[/b]

Case 1: At it's worst, you can wait up to 15 MINUTES to get into one match, which takes lasts like 3 to 7 minutes at most. And THEN the game might just spontaneously crash whenever it feels like it. It seems to have gotten better since the Steam launch

Case 2:
I wasn't able to play with my friends (who bought the game on the Microsoft Store) for 3 WEEKS because the DNS servers were down, and any support tickets were marked as ""answered"" even if the issue wasn't solved. Instead of actually fixing the problem, which was clearly on their end, their support deflected instead and put the blame on the players themselves. Only when the servers went down completely and enough people started complaining about it (after 2 weeks since the issue has started) they actually started doing something, and even then, it took them one week straight to actually fix the problem.

Treat this review as a ""neutral rating"", since Steam doesn't have that option.
Ultimately, the core gameplay is so much fun that I would still highly recommend this game if you're into racing games. Just don't set your expectations for the multiplayer aspect of this game too high because you're just going to end up as disappointed as I am.

Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed Collection,Racing,212480,"Incredibly fun, well designed and easy to get into. The mission mode is something i genuinely believe ever kart racer should strive to emulate. Unlocking characters is a great incentive and its addicting. Also, ryo from shenmue playable, say no more."
Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed Collection,Racing,212480,"It was the last GOOD official Sonic game from Meta era!
I love how the game gave you many remixes to stages, but i miss being able to choose already existing songs for racing, which fitted really well!
Characters are much harder to unlock compared to previous Racing, but it does feel rewarding which i guess is fair, compared to being able to just buy one for making enough coins in 1st game.
The Transforming mechainic is very nice, makes the game stand out more, which is a great benefit.

The only downside, is that this game has Yogcast, but good news, its optional!

Wreckfest,Racing,228380,kinda cool til the dynamics of the game got me a couple of times as i was leading. going down straight-sways. car decides to cut left or right into a wall of whatever. after the fifth time of the same issues> i'm done.  don't need to fight against the players just to get screwed by the game.

Wreckfest,Racing,228380,"Forza fan here... FH4 network/servers showed me middle_finger_both_hands and said they don't like me anymore for online races. So I found my new crush instead!!! Wrrroommm... Craaaackk... Cluuuutch... Baaaanggg!!! Wreckfest racing!!!

Quickly and very subjectively summarising some main WF vs. FH4 points which made me enjoy playing WF:
- WF visuals are on par with FH4 (in some aspects even better and more detailed)
- WF car dynamics and reaction to driving on different surfaces feels kinda more real and less arcade-ish 
- WF  cars soft body destruction... well, nothing to compare here - it is 99% absent in FH4 for an understood reason : )
- WF cars sound more decent
- WF car bottoms are nicely detailed. FH4 has them as a single flat textured polygon.
- Controller mapping could be set almost 1 to 1 to a standard FH4 layout (manual + clutch) - Was very pleased that I had no discomfort form the first minute.

I extremely recommended for all Forza Horizon lovers (as an additional racing experience) to  give Wreckfest a try"

Wreckfest,Racing,228380,"This game is amazing!

I bought it on a bit of a whim, because it was on sale and I didn't have any drift or rally games. I have a decent sim-rig used mainly for Assetto Corsa and RFactor, which I also use for American Truck Simulator. Those are all quite sensible 'simulations', and I wanted something a bit more fun.

Well, Wreckfest is certainly fun! I imagine it's quite good using a gamepad using the top-down view, but with a force-feedback wheel, shifter, handbrake and pedals it's awesome.

The title doesn't really do it any favours, because there is more to this game than just huge crashes and wrecked cars. Yes, there are lots of demolition derby races, and even a last-car-standing mudpit. Watching the massive crashes on the replay is great fun. However, there are also lots of dirt track and circuit races too. The vehicle physics isn't going to worry Assetto Corsa any time, but it's still pretty realistic if you turn off all the driving aids. With a bit of handbrake you can set up some really impressive drifts, although the AI quickly proves that drifting is not the quickest way round the corners.

There's a bit of vehicle upgrading you can do, and to win some of the races you will need to upgrade the car. You can repaint your cars with a load of preset schemes, in an infinite range of colours.

Setting up all the different input devices was a doddle, although it defaults to automatic gears, and finding the setting to switch to manual took longer than it should have! Once I'd done that, it took a couple of minutes to map my handbrake and Fanatec shifter. I also had to remap the wheel and pedals because it had assigned the wrong axes. Easy to do. Unlike RFactor, which seems to forget all my devices every time I play it. Grrrr.

The default Force Feedback setting of 80% was far too high for my wheel. It was fighting me and causing tank-slappers. I turned it down to about 60% and it's way better.

Sadly, the game doesn't support head-tracking, and the FOV setting is rudimentary if you are using a single-screen sim-rig. That's a shame, because driving in-car instead of top-down is really immersive, but in a game like this you need to know where the other cars are. Your car doesn't have mirrors either. There is a HUD, but I have to confess I don't use it much because the game is REALLY intensive! I guess I'll just have to buy a couple more monitors...

The music gets a bit repetitive, which is a shame because it's suitably high-energy hard-rock. It feels like it needs more tracks.

Overall, a great fun game. Get it on sale, because there is quite a lot of DLC and you will want it all!"

Quickly and very subjectively summarising some main WF vs. FH4 points which made me enjoy playing WF:
- WF visuals are on par with FH4 (in some aspects even better and more detailed)
- WF car dynamics and reaction to driving on different surfaces feels kinda more real and less arcade-ish 
- WF  cars soft body destruction... well, nothing to compare here - it is 99% absent in FH4 for an understood reason : )
- WF cars sound more decent
- WF car bottoms are nicely detailed. FH4 has them as a single flat textured polygon.

I’m not saying it is the best, I just see Forza as some sophisticated simulation working for too many years and some people believe that's an unfair or unbeatable advantage. I don’t think that, given the proper work to convince me.

𝙒𝙃𝘼𝙏 𝙏𝙊 𝙀𝙓𝙋𝙀𝘾𝙏

Here’s inside the British and both GT3 and GT4 cars including the tracks of its respective events, and of course its drivers. More about that down the review because of the DLCs, this isn’t exactly a slideshow of “civilian” cars; I love them but the thing here is about the corpo cars, filled with corpo decals, rather than fantasy racing running all naked. Given that, naturally the game abides to Blanpainc rules and regulations. You can race casually, but this isn’t one of those games.

Steering and artificial intelligence is slowly nearing there, even if with unstable curving trying to maintain it, still I have never experienced this before and you can impress other game’s drivers. Everytime I run Assetto Corsa Competizione I can almost smell the gas, if it wasn’t for a few things that still aren’t quite there but hopefully will one day. If you’re interested in this only for screenshots or to admire the scenery, random npcs or how good the grass looks, you got another thing coming. The graphics didn’t impress me and screen shot “cinema hud” options are weird to work with.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513870458

Those are tertiary elements in the scale of importance. What the driver is really interested in after buying; emulation, simulation, steering - I emphasize that part, and competition with all that in motion. But if they want us to truly smell the carbon dioxide, they gotta work more on the outtern details too, more immersive particle effects. That screenshot has filters and reshade mods that the game should have in first place, that impacted my final scoring in this review.

[h1]𝗦𝗧𝗘𝗘𝗥𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗜𝗦 𝗦𝗨𝗣𝗘𝗥𝗕 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗗𝗘𝗧𝗔𝗜𝗟𝗦 𝗧𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗖𝗢𝗠𝗘𝗦 𝗪𝗜𝗧𝗛 𝗜𝗧[/h1]

My first phase testing with the Lamborghini Youngster Programme was humiliating, as if I have never been behind any steering wheels. Yes I had to borrow from a nearby friend just to feel like a pro, but once I returned it, I had to readapt myself with a Xbone joystick - but don’t think this limited me, I managed to program it for the level of realism I like even with a joystick.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513903037

After taking care of my control situation, I decided to tweak my black demon. They give you a Huracàn Super Trofeo that growls like a devil hissing for meat, demanding sacrifices in the temple of speed. The devs decision to start the career at Monza was just too right.

So instead of 60 liters - the default fuel quantity they give you, I deducted only the enough amount for 5 laps instead around 21 liters, super basic but we tend to forget about these - because the game isn’t interested in doing everything for me which is great. Easing pressure, caring about the brakes and other dynamics and vóila, I could finally reach third to last position (better than last position) and with better knowledge I started climbing the ladder. I’m more interested in learning through experience and readings, but you can always look for setups around the the internet and then place it on your files and load it up.

The dynamics are so beautiful and harmonical, so realistic, I could finally see why some pilots in history performed better during rainy weather, to experience that for the first time in my gaming life - ever. Guys like Ayrton Senna in the F1 category for example and so many others.

The fight is different during the rain in the real world, your worries are condensed and the car and the tires are sliced. Little to none beneficial things like cooler brakes and bad omens like thin layers of water under the tires. A driver in the rainy weather would prefer to use the best line to avoid that part of the track that still is wet, not just water puddles because it is more complex than that - the fight during rainy weather is different and this is simulated on where it should. ACC proved me I’m a rainy racer, having greater time results whenever Jupiter is angry.

𝙍𝙀𝘼𝙇𝙄𝙎𝙏𝙄𝘾 𝙍𝘼𝘾𝙄𝙉𝙂 𝙏𝙀𝙉𝘿𝙎 𝙏𝙊 𝙎𝘾𝘼𝙍𝙀 𝘾𝘼𝙎𝙐𝘼𝙇 𝙁𝙐𝙉

That doesn’t mean the casual should avoid it, but I’m afraid they would rather play something else, Competizione still can be tough even on easier modes. The setup isn’t like Dirt Rally 2.0 for example, with bars to slide around even on advanced setups (you’d see bars but it’s different) you either know what you’re doing or you do not. It is intuitive enough to keep you interested in it, experimenting, but you will need to know it anyway because there are not enough hints if you’re out of place. There are only a couple of basic pre-settings, but very often they’re not enough, just a rough bet for the things you’re going to face.

I don’t own any VR and no hero in my vicinity does, can’t rent around here either so you won’t have my views on that, as ironic as it sounds. There is a camera angle you can choose like a first person view from inside the helmet, but I don’t see much bobblehead physics, maybe it wouldn’t work? There is no gravity simulation shaking that camera angle nor when I brake too hard and I think simulation should start thinking about that.

Assetto Corsa Competizione,Sports,805550,"Optimisation has come a long way: I can get above 45 fps with high-demand settings like shadows and reflections turned down 1 notch with 30+ cars in the rain on a 2060s and 2700x.

If you come in with a driving style that suits other games, you will understeer constantly and catastrophically. Forcing the setup to fix this will result in uncontrollable oversteer. You have to relearn how to approach a corner and feel how the cars want to be driven. ""Slow in and fast out"" is more important than ever. Once you've mastered the art of gentle turn-in, the cars feel so alive. Other positives are that the AI actually race themselves (especially at higher difficulty settings), cars all feel different, sounds are absolutely incredible (engine, transmission, exhaust crackles, gears, suspension, bodywork, abs/tc) and the camera views are super customisable. The only negative is that AI difficulty is all over the place, and you can only set it once in career mode. For example I could easily match AI pace at Zolder on Pro difficulty, but on the same difficulty was 3.5 seconds off the pace at brands hatch."

I’m not saying it is the best, I just see Forza as some sophisticated simulation working for too many years and some people believe that's an unfair or unbeatable advantage. I don’t think that, given the proper work to convince me.

Here’s inside the British and both GT3 and GT4 cars including the tracks of its respective events, and of course its drivers. More about that down the review because of the DLCs, this isn’t exactly a slideshow of “civilian” cars; I love them but the thing here is about the corpo cars, filled with corpo decals, rather than fantasy racing running all naked. Given that, naturally the game abides to Blanpainc rules and regulations. You can race casually, but this isn’t one of those games.

Steering and artificial intelligence is slowly nearing there, even if with unstable curving trying to maintain it, still I have never experienced this before and you can impress other game’s drivers. Everytime I run Assetto Corsa Competizione I can almost smell the gas, if it wasn’t for a few things that still aren’t quite there but hopefully will one day. If you’re interested in this only for screenshots or to admire the scenery, random npcs or how good the grass looks, you got another thing coming. The graphics didn’t impress me and screen shot “cinema hud” options are weird to work with.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513870458

Those are tertiary elements in the scale of importance. What the driver is really interested in after buying; emulation, simulation, steering - I emphasize that part, and competition with all that in motion. But if they want us to truly smell the carbon dioxide, they gotta work more on the outtern details too, more immersive particle effects. That screenshot has filters and reshade mods that the game should have in first place, that impacted my final scoring in this review.

My first phase testing with the Lamborghini Youngster Programme was humiliating, as if I have never been behind any steering wheels. Yes I had to borrow from a nearby friend just to feel like a pro, but once I returned it, I had to readapt myself with a Xbone joystick - but don’t think this limited me, I managed to program it for the level of realism I like even with a joystick.

After taking care of my control situation, I decided to tweak my black demon. They give you a Huracàn Super Trofeo that growls like a devil hissing for meat, demanding sacrifices in the temple of speed. The devs decision to start the career at Monza was just too right.

So instead of 60 liters - the default fuel quantity they give you, I deducted only the enough amount for 5 laps instead around 21 liters, super basic but we tend to forget about these - because the game isn’t interested in doing everything for me which is great. Easing pressure, caring about the brakes and other dynamics and vóila, I could finally reach third to last position (better than last position) and with better knowledge I started climbing the ladder. I’m more interested in learning through experience and readings, but you can always look for setups around the the internet and then place it on your files and load it up.

The dynamics are so beautiful and harmonical, so realistic, I could finally see why some pilots in history performed better during rainy weather, to experience that for the first time in my gaming life - ever. Guys like Ayrton Senna in the F1 category for example and so many others.

The fight is different during the rain in the real world, your worries are condensed and the car and the tires are sliced. Little to none beneficial things like cooler brakes and bad omens like thin layers of water under the tires. A driver in the rainy weather would prefer to use the best line to avoid that part of the track that still is wet, not just water puddles because it is more complex than that - the fight during rainy weather is different and this is simulated on where it should. ACC proved me I’m a rainy racer, having greater time results whenever Jupiter is angry.

That doesn’t mean the casual should avoid it, but I’m afraid they would rather play something else, Competizione still can be tough even on easier modes. The setup isn’t like Dirt Rally 2.0 for example, with bars to slide around even on advanced setups (you’d see bars but it’s different) you either know what you’re doing or you do not. It is intuitive enough to keep you interested in it, experimenting, but you will need to know it anyway because there are not enough hints if you’re out of place. There are only a couple of basic pre-settings, but very often they’re not enough, just a rough bet for the things you’re going to face.

The hud seems overwhelming at first but you can remove things. I don’t recommend that because the devs thought about everything, even swapping colors in the speed meter when you need to shift but got no time to look at it, meant to alert your peripheral vision.

Horizon Chase Turbo,Sports,389140,"If you want some casual racing game to kill the time or if you remember the old games like TopGear, this might very well be what you want.

Horizon Chase Turbo is a very simple racing game. There's no worries with ideal racing line or tyre wear, you just plant your foot on the gas and go ahead, dodging the incoming cars. While you do it, you can also grab medals on the track, that at the end of the race, add up to your score. With enough score you unlock the next races and more cars for you to choose from.

It's a cool little game but not without its flaws. One of which is there's a upgrade system in the game, which is welcome sure, but it's implement in the weirdest way possible. As you get your score higher, you unlock races to run for those upgrades, once you win the race you'll have a small selection to choose from, but after you choose one upgrade that is added to all your cars. So sure, more grip to go faster on the turns is always nice, but i would like for my gripy cars to have some top speed instead.

Also, if you remember the original TopGear on the SNES, you might remember that game had pitstops, because each car would use fuel at a different rate, so the slowest car could very well win by simply not stopping or making a splash&go. No such a thing in this game tho, which is not a deal breaker, but something that it's odd to not have when the game lift so much of its gameplay from the TopGear games.

Music is also something very much close to the soundtrack of TopGear, specially the first game, with some songs almost identical but slightly changed for copyright reasons, i'm sure.

Overall, it's a great little game that doesn't take it self seriously and it's just fine for when you don't want to take it seriously too."

Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"I gotta say, the main character is some sort of god in this. He can rebuild an entire engine in under an hour. He can slot in an entire exhaust system as if it's Lego. He can somehow remove the fuel pump without removing anything else on the car. He can determine the exact condition of a set of brake pads through the rims and caliper. Everything is an exact percentage to this man, not ""good"", ""worn"" or ""needs replacing"". Hell, he can replace a timing belt in a matter of seconds. I envy this man.
If you like playing as god, and like working on cars without doing the tedious stuff (or working on literally any French car), then this is the game for you.

In all seriousness, this game helps you learn a lot about the different parts of cars and what they do. I'm no mechanic, I just got a lot of experience on repairing my own cars because they've either been French or just old run down junkboxes on wheels. But this is enjoyable. It's satisfying refurbishing cars, and rebuilding engines. Obviously, it doesn't cover absolutely every aspect. But it will probably give you a much better idea of what the mechanic's telling you when you ever have to take your own car into a garage irl, instead of going ""Oh yeah, oh ok, yeah replace whatever tf that is please"".

Great game to pass the time, and also learn a bit about cars on the side.

I grabbed this on a sale and I think I paid around $10 for it, and it's worth every penny. The game is really separated into a few smaller meta-games.

On one hand, you've got your phone orders; these are customers that need help with their cars. Obviously as the game starts off you do things like perform basic brake service, changing oil and filters, and very minor improvements. On the other hand; you've got complete car restorations. I mean sex is great and all, but have you bought an old rusted 1962 AC Cobra from an old barn and restored it to 100% of it's former glory with a complete rebuild and then turned around and sold it for a tidy $80K profit?

As you complete jobs, you earn experience and you level up, which provides you with talent points you can use to do things like move faster, unscrew things quicker, and even expand your garage. The expansion of the garage is the most satisfying thing as it often results in unlocking other great features, like the engine pulling crane, the battery charger, and eventually the interior detail shop or the body shop/paint shop.

I have only put about 23 hours into CMS2018 and I feel satisfied with my purchase. The game is enjoyable. It's a zen garden but with bolts and rust instead of plants. It's a fun way to wind down after a stressful day at work.

I will admit, the game is not without it's flaws: The music is terrifyingly bad (in my own opinion) and there is some strange UI lag from time to time. There is also an unreasonable painful grind to get to level 30 (the level in which you unlock the body and paint shop). I often found myself finishing every single order I could as quickly I as I could, regardless of what the customer wanted - even if it meant doing the most bare minimum, JUST to get the XP.

But even with the minor faults, the game is fun and worth the cost. Go out there and fix up some cars!"

If you are not really into cars this might not be the game for you but I think you can still enjoy it without being into cars. the game may feel repetitive some times in the first part of the game, you don't have much money and you only really work on brakes. Once you unlock the junkyard and have more money to work with having project cars is a lot of fun. The sandbox mode is pretty fun but I do find it a little boring after awhile, the story mode makes building cars a lot more fun with having to manage your money.

Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"I gotta say, the main character is some sort of god in this. He can rebuild an entire engine in under an hour. He can slot in an entire exhaust system as if it's Lego. He can somehow remove the fuel pump without removing anything else on the car. He can determine the exact condition of a set of brake pads through the rims and caliper. Everything is an exact percentage to this man, not ""good"", ""worn"" or ""needs replacing"". Hell, he can replace a timing belt in a matter of seconds. I envy this man.
If you like playing as god, and like working on cars without doing the tedious stuff (or working on literally any French car), then this is the game for you.

In all seriousness, this game helps you learn a lot about the different parts of cars and what they do. I'm no mechanic, I just got a lot of experience on repairing my own cars because they've either been French or just old run down junkboxes on wheels. But this is enjoyable. It's satisfying refurbishing cars, and rebuilding engines. Obviously, it doesn't cover absolutely every aspect. But it will probably give you a much better idea of what the mechanic's telling you when you ever have to take your own car into a garage irl, instead of going ""Oh yeah, oh ok, yeah replace whatever tf that is please"".

Great game to pass the time, and also learn a bit about cars on the side.
9/10 - Only a couple of crash bugs going into barns, but otherwise a neat game."

Retrowave,Racing,1239690,"Escape to a future past that only exists in your imagination, listen to beautiful music, and enjoy the classic cars like the 80s Camaro and various exotics whose names are lost to my memory.

This game is an incredibly relaxing way to go to a familiar past that never existed. I really appreciate the updates of letting the music and track continue after the level is over and it shows the developer cares about what the community wants to see. This is easily one of my favorite games to sit back, have a beer, relax, and lose track of reality. Devs, if you're reading this - please add the 1980s MK2 Toyota Supra. This was my first car and it should be enshrined in the retro era highlighted by this beautiful project. A 1980s Mustang would be amazing too."

Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"It's been a while since I played a NFS game. The last NFS game I enjoyed was Prostreet and Shift.  

Why I bought it?
I bought this game after I saw it on sale and read the positive reviews. I had stayed away from the franchise as it had become stale in recent years and it seemed like this game was much better than what was offered in the past. I even checked out some channels on Youtube that made long format reviews and they too praised it for what it had to offer. 

What was good?
The graphics are amazing. The game looks really good and it runs very well on my computer. The cars and the options to customise them is excellent. I like all the cars that were included in the game and loved how they handle and sound. There are numerous ways to customise your car and I'm not sure what was included in previous games but I really liked the options they gave us. I spent a lot of time customising the cars and enjoyed looking at various user generated paint jobs that you could apply on your car. It was fun to see what the community had designed and I used a lot of them on my cars. You can also choose your character and customise the clothes your character wears. I also liked that they had off road racing in addition to road racing. You have to tune your car for these races and it was fun to change things up. Finally, the map was well done - very detailed and fun to drive around. Palm city is very beautiful and there are different districts within the map that have its own features.  

What sucked?
I grew up playing the original NFS games and the Underground games were my favourite. The original Most Wanted however is perhaps the gold standard. NFS Heat, to put it bluntly, simply does not measure up to what those games offered. I don't think progression has been made and I'll list my issues with this game. First, the racing aspect of NFS Heat. In the past, we had variety in the types of races. In this game, all we have are Circuits, Sprints and Drifts. Drifts are not even races - you've got to beat a score by driving on the track solo. They do switch it to off-road tracks but on the off-road tracks, you again have Circuits and Sprints. For comparison, in the Underground games and Most Wanted, you had drag races, outruns, speed traps, toll booths and you drifted with competition instead of being solo on the track. You also had pink slips and higher winnings if you played at higher difficulty levels or had good timings. Second, they've pulled out aspects of the game that were fun in the past. Like getting your car on a magazine cover with a pretty girl for making your car look nice. You could take pictures of the car by showing off how you'd customised it as well for the magazine cover. You'd even have races that you'd need to win to get on the magazine cover. Anyone that played Underground 2 will know what I'm talking about. Third, while I can live with certain features being pulled out, I don't understand why they changed the ""Heat"" system in the game. The way this system works in this game is not fun at all. I lose the heat I earned and it resets after the night ends.Why don't the police care when I break traffic rules during the day? They only care at night for whatever reason. The police are overpowered - I mean they do give us options to defend ourselves but the damage system limits the fun. Why limit the fun? Who cares about damage to your car? Bashing cops is what made police chases fun! All I do in this game is get my Heat level up by winning races and once the multiplier kicks in and I have a nice chunk of points, I end the night. I can't bash the police, destroy road blocks and simply have fun toying with them. My car is fragile, takes damage and at higher Heat levels, cops can do a lot of damage and have insane driving skills.  You tend to play it safe so that you don't lose the multiplier that influences your reputation points. They could've at least given infinite repairs at gas stations but again, the entire damage system limits the fun! I can understand what they went for in this game, but in my opinion, realism in an arcade racing game makes no sense. Fourth, the soundtrack isn't great. A couple of songs are good but most are not memorable. My fifth and final point, the story. Good Lord - who wrote this trash? What have they done to the story lines in these games? It doesn't have to be a masterpiece but c'mon man!! Let me give you one of the story lines - spoilers - skip to closing comments if you don't want to know this story. I'm putting this in to highlight why the story sucks. They talk about how you have to get into the ""League"" - the ""League"" being a group of drivers that are considered elite. As the story progresses, you have TWO races with League members and are admitted to the ""League"" AFTER completing the main story and exposing the bad guy!!! There are no races against other League drivers - there is no struggle, rising up the ranks - you are simply admitted to the league because you had TWO races with League members as a part of a story related mission. What????? How did I prove I was elite? I only beat the two drivers in the League - they even sort of imply that it's not a race and they are sort of doing it to help your mission. Why did Leagues members even want to help me? Why do they care? Why didn't I get to race the best driver in the League? Why couldn't I beat that guy and become the best driver? Why couldn't I take his car and title as reward for beating him? Why couldn't he have betrayed me at the beginning of the game by stealing my car or threatening my girl?  Good Lord - you can come up with so many story lines and make it way more interesting than what was in this game.

Closing Comments:
I don't know what has happened to this franchise. On a superficial level, this game is simply the best. Graphics, customisation, environment, cars, sounds and all of that - nothing in the NFS franchise compares. In terms of game play, they've taken out the fun. It feels like the people that design these games are not gamers. Even if they are gamers, they are not allowed to take risks or innovate. I've made a lot of comparisons to older NFS games and maybe that's not fair. But think about it, if NFS Heat was on it's own and was released as the first NFS game, would ""Need for Speed"" be the franchise it is? To summarise, NFS Heat offers a sterile and boring experience. I finished the game, did some side stuff and I can tell you for certain that I will not replay this game. If you have a Need for Speed, then this is not the game you are looking for."

Need for Speed™ Heat is the latest installation of EA has and sadly their devs ""Ghost Games"" have shut down meaning there will be no more official updates that we can hear about this game. The car customization here is solid, the physics are slightly arcadey, however there is a drift or grip car as it was always there since the Need for Speed™ (2015). The cops here are very aggressive most of us liked it and most of us did not but for me I love it. Grinding Money and XP here is very different from any average games out there. They have implemented Day and Night race that turns out to be different, if you're in a Day Race you'll get a credits for every race you win. But in the Night, things are getting interesting, one race of a night will make the cops look for you and at the night race or a cop chase gets you an XP. (basically they call it a REP). As for multiplayer, you can only get to play with your friends here, because everyone has their own business. Additionally you can't remap your controller aside from your keyboard. Also this game is expensive costing at $80 because they only offer us on PC version is the Deluxe Edition and not the standard ones so I find it difficult to buy it at full price. If you consider to buy this game, buy it on sale. [b]Recommended![/b]"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Any 'racing game' that allows the people and/or AI behind 1st to speed up to catch up, isn't a racing game. 
It's an on-rails experience. 
The further I am ahead of you should NOT increase your speed, or slow me down.

You are effectively removing agency from the players.

Refund, please."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Although I do recommend NFS:H, there's a lot of glaring issues with the game. I'll start with the good:

1. Customization
I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of customization available. There's a lot of name brand bodykits (Liberty Walk, C-West, Rocket Bunny), wheels (Work, BBS), and stickers. You can also tune your car based on the type of driving you plan on doing (off-road, drift, race, on-track). Even the most minuscule details can be added, like stretched tires. There's also an option to customize the pitch of your exhaust, which I thought was very helpful.

2. Car Options
There are a solid amount of cars in this game available for customization. Each appeals to different tastes: you have JDM legends such as the RX-7 and GTR, American muscle like Mustang and Corvette, and exotics from the Countach to McLarens. You can customize all of them in unique ways as well.

3. Setting
Palm City is a representation of Miami. It's an large city with a lot of beaches and palm trees, the aesthetic you'd expect. The map is pretty big and has some diversity in each zone it's divided into. I really like the look of Palm City itself, especially at night.

4. Running ability
I have a shitty laptop (GeForce 940MX, i5-6300HQ, 8 GB RAM) and NFS actually runs really well. Even if you have the minimum, the game still looks pretty.

Now time for the cons. These are mostly just mild inconveniences but the first three are major issues and what I believe to be the weak points of the game.

1. Story
The story kind of sucks and is the standard cookie-cutter ""make a name for yourself"" plot out of every single racing game on earth. It's not bad, just mediocre at best. I haven't finished the game completely and can't fully judge the story yet, but I've heard complaints about it being short and how you barely do anything to qualify for this ""super elite group"" at the end.

2. Police system
The worst part about the game by far. Once these mfs show up, you can guarantee you either have to increase your heat by destroying one of them or lose all your money and experience once they bust you. The cops are way too fast to outrun, they will always be on your tail. It makes sense why this would happen in the supercharged Charger they bring out if you keep running, but not the normal Crown Vics the cops have. You're driving a highly tuned race car! That Crown Vic should have gotten dusted in seconds. You just have to get lucky in the instance that the cop hits a wall or another car and can't catch up fast enough.
The cops also spawn in a way that makes it really easy for them to join a chase and soon enough you have 4 cops on your ass. I get the ""reinforcements arriving"" part but the spawns get incredibly annoying. Did I mention that destroying cop cars barely works because your own car takes damage as well, which is a mechanic entirely new to the series?
Why don't cops care if you do anything during the day? Why do they only bring out the ultra-zealous unit at night? It's like playing GTA, you could run a red light going 160 in the opposite lane past a cop and they don't even mind. If one spots you at night after you do a street race, they go ham.
The radio chatter bothers me so much, it sounds like they got a whole bunch of children who just learned swear words to record the lines. I get that the cops at night are supposed to be super aggressive and mean, but oftentimes it backfires horribly and just makes me laugh. When [spoiler] Ana's car gets impounded [/spoiler] the cop who did it made me cry laughing. He sounded like a R. Lee Ermey from Wish. 
Your character: ""Yes, sir.""
The officer: ""YES, OFFICER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""
Overall, I feel like the police system could have been implemented a lot better. I personally would have made them easier to outrun initially, but if you continue to have run-ins with them, it becomes harder to do so.

3. Soundtrack
Aside from a few exceptions (Out The Mud by Future and Lil Baby comes to mind), the soundtrack gets old really quickly. It consists of rap music and an overwhelming amount of Latin and EDM tracks. I get that Latin kind of sets the vibe of summer and EDM is popular within NFS games, but it really seems like there's a total of 10 songs in the game. Unless you really like hearing Cardi B's verse in ""Writing on the Wall"" or the same shitty bass drop 50 times every two hours, I'd suggest muting the audio and playing your own music in the background.

4. Exhaust popping
This is the really nitpicky stuff at this point, but it bothers me so much. When driving your car, by default it's tuned to a really aggressive ""pop and bang tune"" setup that is honestly ridiculous. Heavily tuned cars in real life tend to backfire when downshifting, but in this game it's incredible how much they do so. If you slam down the gas from a dead stop, all you hear is POP POP POP POP POP until you hit second gear. Thankfully you can make it stop in the exhaust tuning menu, but the fact that it's enabled by default is strange.

5. Types of races
I was disappointed by the amount of races included in this game. There seems to be only 3: sprints, circuits, and drifting. Drifting isn't even a race, rather, it's just trying to beat a score. Previous NFS games had a lot more diversity when it came to the amount of races, and it's unclear why this downgrade happened.

6. Destruction of obstacles
While this game was really nostalgic to me in terms of similarity to classic arcade racing games I played, I didn't think it would extend THIS far. If you crash into just about anything, it falls apart and disappears. Trees, cement columns, stone walls, etc. It was honestly very strange to hit a tree for the first time and see it collapse instead of your car just hitting the tree like in GTA. Although it stays true to the arcade genre, this aspect definitely detracts from the realism.

7. Car damage system
I mentioned how this mechanic existed in the police section, but it's implemented oddly. The police are the only ones who can seriously damage your car, and they will fully disable it in about 4 hits. Strangely, your car is basically invincible otherwise. You can crash head-on with another car at 150 mph and only suffer a single pixel line of red on the damage meter. The only thing that can really harm your car outside of police is falling from a height.

8. Amount of pedestrians/vehicles
The first one makes sense, because having cars run over random people is too GTA-esque, but it definitely takes away from the realism: the city just feels empty. The second is a blessing and a curse: there are very few vehicles, but they only seem to spawn in places inconvenient to you. Trying to pass that stupid Mustang in a night race? G35 spawns right in front of you and you crash right into it head on! The cars will spawn in discreetly, i.e. around a corner, but they just serve as inconveniences most of the time. The diversity of NPC vehicles are also very lacking, there's basically 4 in total. All I really see are a G35, BMW 3-series, some pickup truck, and an ambulance.

While the strong points of this game are there, a lot of smaller issues also exist with it as well. This game was really nostalgic since it appealed to my childhood playing arcade racing games at Funway. As a car enthusiast, I had a lot of fun with this game so far and I'm eager to put even more hours into it. My experience was good, but the issues were things that temporarily distracted me from my enjoyment of the game. I can see why they would be bigger for other people and cause them to dislike the game.
Also grab this on sale if you can, I got it during the Open Worlds sale for like $14 and that's so much better than the exorbitant retail price of $70. I'd say this game is worth $60 max. This game is also from EA, so you have to install Origin on your computer (if you don't have it already). Origin has been heavily criticized and is incredibly slow, so be mindful of that."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"i thought i could trust the reviews for this game but i was wrong. the game is decent enough to be better than payback; they settled for decent rather than polishing some of the genuinely good mechanics it was going for. generic formula good enough to please the low standards of current NFS fans.

music is garbage and for a racing game their car assets look mediocre. always raining. we get it, you added misting and dynamic puddles."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"I paid 19 EUR for this game as part of a bundle with NFS Hot Pursuit Remastered. Since they seem to be evenly priced otherwise I'll judge it as if I've paid 9.50 EUR for it alone.

Long story short... not even close to worth it. I went in with very low expectations since I'm familiar with Ghost's previous work and even I was taken back by just how bad this game is.


GRAPHICS & PERFORMANCE:

- It's very poorly optimized... like, very, very poorly optimized. It even lags during the pre-rendered cutscenes. Lowering most of the graphics settings makes absolutely no difference performance wise, only the supersampling does.
- Takes a very long time to load, we're talking GTA5 loading times here, on an SSD.
- No dynamic time of day, despite the fact that the previous game (as well as pretty much every open world game made after 2015) has it.
- Car damage was downgraded from the previous games, which is a shame because it was quite good.
- Way too much teal, this is a problem that's plagued Frostbite for years but Ghost actually seemed to have fixed it in the previous game, now it's back with a vengeance.

+ Car models look great... at least on the outside.
+ Doesn't ask you to restart the game when changing graphics options.
+ Whereas other recent-ish games downscale the graphics to improve performance, NFS Heat actually gives you that option. It's too bad most of us will be forced to use it anyway, but it's nice that it exists.
+ Despite the horrendous performance the game does look quite crisp, even when downscaled to 75%.


AUDIO:

- Car sounds are pretty mediocre, they're unique to each car for the most part but none of them are anything to write home about. The sound tuning mechanic is ambitious but doesn't seem to actually affect the sound that much.
- Soundtrack is terrible, literally just sounds like the lead sound engineer just pasted his Spotify playlist into it and called it a day.
- Very buggy, car sounds cutting out briefly is quite common.
- Voice acting makes Undercover look like Citizen Kane.


CONTROLS:

- Much like it's predecessors it features virtually NO mouse support aside from moving the camera around in the garage, that's it.
- Hands down the worst keyboard driving controls I've ever seen in a driving game of any kind, even Flatout 3 driving is better, let that sink in.


SINGLEPLAYER:

+ Bodywork customization is alright, not nearly as ambitious as Underground 2 or Carbon but it's pretty decent.

- Paint customization has been dowgraded from the previous games, the material editor was replaced with pre-made materials which offer a bit more variety but cannot be used on vinyls.
- Performance customization has a lot of options, including engine swaps. However they are all linear upgrades, it's not like Forza where you have to pick & mix your parts carefully depending on the class or type of race, here the highest level parts/engines are always meta.
- The story is mediocre, which is probably the worst thing you can say about it. Since it's neither good enough to be memorable nor bad enough to be funny, it's just... meh.
- The day/night switching mechanic is unnecessary and only limits gameplay. Also feels more like an excuse for not featuring a dynamic time cycle.
- The driving physics are virtually non-existent. Also it reverted back to the NFS15 style of brake-to-drift mechanic, meaning that your car starts drifting whenever it wants to. This is a problem Payback did not have.
- The police AI is copy-pasted from Payback except they appear in free roam now, which would be great if it weren't for the addition of a health bar that cuts your chase short if you even think about having any fun.


MULTIPLAYER:

- No text chat.
- Matchmaking is quite poor, though not nearly as bad as Forza Horizon 4's.


OTHER:

- Car list is poor, it's also copy-pasted from Payback with barely any new cars, except now they've added like 3 - 4 variants of each. They did bring back Ferrari though, for what it's worth... which isn't much given that none of the cars in this game really drive like cars.
- Sticks ads and political messaging in your face when you're in the main menu.
- It has a very short life expectancy considering the DRM it uses, the fact that EA already ended support for it, the fact that Ghost is on the chopping block AND the fact that it didn't have that many players to begin with.
- EA


If you're itching for an arcade racing game get Forza Horizon 4, you'll likely pay a lot more but it looks, sounds and plays a lot better... when the servers are working at least."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Did you know you can't even remap your controller in this game? Even after over 10 years of developing driving games, you're stuck with one controller layout the entire game. *claps*"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,best game
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"EA Origin messed up loading of the game. Can' even boot in, how am I suppose to play this. I believe this is a good game buy optimize your origin better. I""m out"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"If you have Forza Horizon 4 don't buy this, plus the music if awful."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"First NFS i played? NFS III. Last one i played before Heat? Rivals.
Other racing games i played recently: The crew 2, Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally 2.0, Project Cars 2 and Forza Motorsport 7.


This game feels like a downgrade from Rivals. Not in all aspects, tho 

where it goes right:

-It is challenging, opponents and pursuits can give you a run for your money.
-It's straightforward (most NFS games are)
-You can customize your car to levels lost in NFSU2
-Car variety.

But It also borks a lot of things:

Characters and voice overs are lame, not as lame as payback, but that was never NFS strong point after MW 2005. Soundtrack is quite forgettable, 
The inability to disable the tap throttle do drift thing is utterly annoying, I don't wanna drift in every damn corner, handling in general feels stiff and quite heavy.
City seems post apocalyptic, everything seems dead, even the very low traffic density reinforces that idea.
Graphics for some reason are okay, even maxing everything out on ultra, it doesn't seem/feel like a 2019/2020 game.

If you wanna some fun, don't wanna anything complex and only like cars, get NFS Heat (or warez rivals, since the official system is borked), If you like a pickup and play racing game with variety, Get the Crew 2. IF you like realism, you're in the wrong place, pal.

I'm refunding this one, i guess i had too high hopes ot this isn't simply my cup of tea.

Not worth the full price, get it on sale."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,Car so fast I got pulled over in real life !
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"[h1]Short description:[/h1] Only buy it if you like good graphics, cars and customization and the game is on sale.

[h1]Long description:[/h1]
I really love car customization games, and this game has [b]a lot of options[/b] I appreciate. You can make [u]your own designs[/u] and there are [u]crazy paint options[/u] for many hours of editing. It still has some flaws; you cannot make a group of decals, or save a group of decals to save it and use it in multiple designs, lack of decal navigation shortcuts (these features are present in Forza games). 

Speaking about gameplay, the driving mechanics are pretty basic and arcade (as expected). But there is one thing I did not like: a [b]horrible double-tap to drift[/b] on the gas pedal button. This was a game breaker for me, in my opinion, one of the worst ideas ever implemented, but maybe people liked it, maybe it is just not my taste.

Another con is that [b][u]you CANNOT remap controller keys[/u][/b]. Even having an official Xbox One controller, I had to use the great Steam controller configuration for my buttons to do what I want. Honestly this is a super scumbag idea. Not sure if this is a rocket science thing or something you cannot integrate in the game engine, but c'mon, this is a basic game feature.

About the police when they chase you, man, that thing is brutal. Be careful when you race at night. I have not played too much in the night but last time I tried, the cop cars felt like damn ferrari indestructible tanks.

Also you may have trouble when starting up the game, because EA Origin and EA Desktop are not the same and present problems when you start the game and they are both active. You will have to close EA Desktop and leave EA Origin open to start the game. 

If at this point,  playing NFS Heat still sounds good to you, then I'm pretty sure you will enjoy the game."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,its fun and hard
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"I wanted to have my nostalgia moment with this arcade racer but NFS heat does not quite feel like any former NSF game.

The story was cringe and the game only has 20 or so soundtracks all of which do not appeal to me, to say it lightly.
The open world racing aspect I didn't really notice it felt mostly empty with maybe 1/3 player visible on the map in a 1h span.

Graphics are great and it ran smoothly.

Would recommend only for NSF hardcore fans"

"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"It's been a while since I played a NFS game. The last NFS game I enjoyed was Prostreet and Shift.  

Why I bought it?
I bought this game after I saw it on sale and read the positive reviews. I had stayed away from the franchise as it had become stale in recent years and it seemed like this game was much better than what was offered in the past. I even checked out some channels on Youtube that made long format reviews and they too praised it for what it had to offer. 

What was good?
The graphics are amazing. The game looks really good and it runs very well on my computer. The cars and the options to customise them is excellent. I like all the cars that were included in the game and loved how they handle and sound. There are numerous ways to customise your car and I'm not sure what was included in previous games but I really liked the options they gave us. I spent a lot of time customising the cars and enjoyed looking at various user generated paint jobs that you could apply on your car. It was fun to see what the community had designed and I used a lot of them on my cars. You can also choose your character and customise the clothes your character wears. I also liked that they had off road racing in addition to road racing. You have to tune your car for these races and it was fun to change things up. Finally, the map was well done - very detailed and fun to drive around. Palm city is very beautiful and there are different districts within the map that have its own features.  

What sucked?
I grew up playing the original NFS games and the Underground games were my favourite. The original Most Wanted however is perhaps the gold standard. NFS Heat, to put it bluntly, simply does not measure up to what those games offered. I don't think progression has been made and I'll list my issues with this game. First, the racing aspect of NFS Heat. In the past, we had variety in the types of races. In this game, all we have are Circuits, Sprints and Drifts. Drifts are not even races - you've got to beat a score by driving on the track solo. They do switch it to off-road tracks but on the off-road tracks, you again have Circuits and Sprints. For comparison, in the Underground games and Most Wanted, you had drag races, outruns, speed traps, toll booths and you drifted with competition instead of being solo on the track. You also had pink slips and higher winnings if you played at higher difficulty levels or had good timings. Second, they've pulled out aspects of the game that were fun in the past. Like getting your car on a magazine cover with a pretty girl for making your car look nice. You could take pictures of the car by showing off how you'd customised it as well for the magazine cover. You'd even have races that you'd need to win to get on the magazine cover. Anyone that played Underground 2 will know what I'm talking about. Third, while I can live with certain features being pulled out, I don't understand why they changed the ""Heat"" system in the game. The way this system works in this game is not fun at all. I lose the heat I earned and it resets after the night ends.Why don't the police care when I break traffic rules during the day? They only care at night for whatever reason. The police are overpowered - I mean they do give us options to defend ourselves but the damage system limits the fun. Why limit the fun? Who cares about damage to your car? Bashing cops is what made police chases fun! All I do in this game is get my Heat level up by winning races and once the multiplier kicks in and I have a nice chunk of points, I end the night. I can't bash the police, destroy road blocks and simply have fun toying with them. My car is fragile, takes damage and at higher Heat levels, cops can do a lot of damage and have insane driving skills.  You tend to play it safe so that you don't lose the multiplier that influences your reputation points. They could've at least given infinite repairs at gas stations but again, the entire damage system limits the fun! I can understand what they went for in this game, but in my opinion, realism in an arcade racing game makes no sense. Fourth, the soundtrack isn't great. A couple of songs are good but most are not memorable. My fifth and final point, the story. Good Lord - who wrote this trash? What have they done to the story lines in these games? It doesn't have to be a masterpiece but c'mon man!! Let me give you one of the story lines - spoilers - skip to closing comments if you don't want to know this story. I'm putting this in to highlight why the story sucks. They talk about how you have to get into the ""League"" - the ""League"" being a group of drivers that are considered elite. As the story progresses, you have TWO races with League members and are admitted to the ""League"" AFTER completing the main story and exposing the bad guy!!! There are no races against other League drivers - there is no struggle, rising up the ranks - you are simply admitted to the league because you had TWO races with League members as a part of a story related mission. What????? How did I prove I was elite? I only beat the two drivers in the League - they even sort of imply that it's not a race and they are sort of doing it to help your mission. Why did Leagues members even want to help me? Why do they care? Why didn't I get to race the best driver in the League? Why couldn't I beat that guy and become the best driver? Why couldn't I take his car and title as reward for beating him? Why couldn't he have betrayed me at the beginning of the game by stealing my car or threatening my girl?  Good Lord - you can come up with so many story lines and make it way more interesting than what was in this game.

Closing Comments:
I don't know what has happened to this franchise. On a superficial level, this game is simply the best. Graphics, customisation, environment, cars, sounds and all of that - nothing in the NFS franchise compares. In terms of game play, they've taken out the fun. It feels like the people that design these games are not gamers. Even if they are gamers, they are not allowed to take risks or innovate. I've made a lot of comparisons to older NFS games and maybe that's not fair. But think about it, if NFS Heat was on it's own and was released as the first NFS game, would ""Need for Speed"" be the franchise it is? To summarise, NFS Heat offers a sterile and boring experience. I finished the game, did some side stuff and I can tell you for certain that I will not replay this game. If you have a Need for Speed, then this is not the game you are looking for."

Need for Speed™ Heat is the latest installation of EA has and sadly their devs ""Ghost Games"" have shut down meaning there will be no more official updates that we can hear about this game. The car customization here is solid, the physics are slightly arcadey, however there is a drift or grip car as it was always there since the Need for Speed™ (2015). The cops here are very aggressive most of us liked it and most of us did not but for me I love it. Grinding Money and XP here is very different from any average games out there. They have implemented Day and Night race that turns out to be different, if you're in a Day Race you'll get a credits for every race you win. But in the Night, things are getting interesting, one race of a night will make the cops look for you and at the night race or a cop chase gets you an XP. (basically they call it a REP). As for multiplayer, you can only get to play with your friends here, because everyone has their own business. Additionally you can't remap your controller aside from your keyboard. Also this game is expensive costing at $80 because they only offer us on PC version is the Deluxe Edition and not the standard ones so I find it difficult to buy it at full price. If you consider to buy this game, buy it on sale. [b]Recommended![/b]"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Any 'racing game' that allows the people and/or AI behind 1st to speed up to catch up, isn't a racing game. 
It's an on-rails experience. 
The further I am ahead of you should NOT increase your speed, or slow me down.

You are effectively removing agency from the players.

Refund, please."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Although I do recommend NFS:H, there's a lot of glaring issues with the game. I'll start with the good:

1. Customization
I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of customization available. There's a lot of name brand bodykits (Liberty Walk, C-West, Rocket Bunny), wheels (Work, BBS), and stickers. You can also tune your car based on the type of driving you plan on doing (off-road, drift, race, on-track). Even the most minuscule details can be added, like stretched tires. There's also an option to customize the pitch of your exhaust, which I thought was very helpful.

2. Car Options
There are a solid amount of cars in this game available for customization. Each appeals to different tastes: you have JDM legends such as the RX-7 and GTR, American muscle like Mustang and Corvette, and exotics from the Countach to McLarens. You can customize all of them in unique ways as well.

3. Setting
Palm City is a representation of Miami. It's an large city with a lot of beaches and palm trees, the aesthetic you'd expect. The map is pretty big and has some diversity in each zone it's divided into. I really like the look of Palm City itself, especially at night.

4. Running ability
I have a shitty laptop (GeForce 940MX, i5-6300HQ, 8 GB RAM) and NFS actually runs really well. Even if you have the minimum, the game still looks pretty.

Now time for the cons. These are mostly just mild inconveniences but the first three are major issues and what I believe to be the weak points of the game.

1. Story
The story kind of sucks and is the standard cookie-cutter ""make a name for yourself"" plot out of every single racing game on earth. It's not bad, just mediocre at best. I haven't finished the game completely and can't fully judge the story yet, but I've heard complaints about it being short and how you barely do anything to qualify for this ""super elite group"" at the end.

2. Police system
The worst part about the game by far. Once these mfs show up, you can guarantee you either have to increase your heat by destroying one of them or lose all your money and experience once they bust you. The cops are way too fast to outrun, they will always be on your tail. It makes sense why this would happen in the supercharged Charger they bring out if you keep running, but not the normal Crown Vics the cops have. You're driving a highly tuned race car! That Crown Vic should have gotten dusted in seconds. You just have to get lucky in the instance that the cop hits a wall or another car and can't catch up fast enough.
The cops also spawn in a way that makes it really easy for them to join a chase and soon enough you have 4 cops on your ass. I get the ""reinforcements arriving"" part but the spawns get incredibly annoying. Did I mention that destroying cop cars barely works because your own car takes damage as well, which is a mechanic entirely new to the series?
Why don't cops care if you do anything during the day? Why do they only bring out the ultra-zealous unit at night? It's like playing GTA, you could run a red light going 160 in the opposite lane past a cop and they don't even mind. If one spots you at night after you do a street race, they go ham.
The radio chatter bothers me so much, it sounds like they got a whole bunch of children who just learned swear words to record the lines. I get that the cops at night are supposed to be super aggressive and mean, but oftentimes it backfires horribly and just makes me laugh. When [spoiler] Ana's car gets impounded [/spoiler] the cop who did it made me cry laughing. He sounded like a R. Lee Ermey from Wish. 
Your character: ""Yes, sir.""
The officer: ""YES, OFFICER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""
Overall, I feel like the police system could have been implemented a lot better. I personally would have made them easier to outrun initially, but if you continue to have run-ins with them, it becomes harder to do so.

3. Soundtrack
Aside from a few exceptions (Out The Mud by Future and Lil Baby comes to mind), the soundtrack gets old really quickly. It consists of rap music and an overwhelming amount of Latin and EDM tracks. I get that Latin kind of sets the vibe of summer and EDM is popular within NFS games, but it really seems like there's a total of 10 songs in the game. Unless you really like hearing Cardi B's verse in ""Writing on the Wall"" or the same shitty bass drop 50 times every two hours, I'd suggest muting the audio and playing your own music in the background.

4. Exhaust popping
This is the really nitpicky stuff at this point, but it bothers me so much. When driving your car, by default it's tuned to a really aggressive ""pop and bang tune"" setup that is honestly ridiculous. Heavily tuned cars in real life tend to backfire when downshifting, but in this game it's incredible how much they do so. If you slam down the gas from a dead stop, all you hear is POP POP POP POP POP until you hit second gear. Thankfully you can make it stop in the exhaust tuning menu, but the fact that it's enabled by default is strange.

5. Types of races
I was disappointed by the amount of races included in this game. There seems to be only 3: sprints, circuits, and drifting. Drifting isn't even a race, rather, it's just trying to beat a score. Previous NFS games had a lot more diversity when it came to the amount of races, and it's unclear why this downgrade happened.

6. Destruction of obstacles
While this game was really nostalgic to me in terms of similarity to classic arcade racing games I played, I didn't think it would extend THIS far. If you crash into just about anything, it falls apart and disappears. Trees, cement columns, stone walls, etc. It was honestly very strange to hit a tree for the first time and see it collapse instead of your car just hitting the tree like in GTA. Although it stays true to the arcade genre, this aspect definitely detracts from the realism.

7. Car damage system
I mentioned how this mechanic existed in the police section, but it's implemented oddly. The police are the only ones who can seriously damage your car, and they will fully disable it in about 4 hits. Strangely, your car is basically invincible otherwise. You can crash head-on with another car at 150 mph and only suffer a single pixel line of red on the damage meter. The only thing that can really harm your car outside of police is falling from a height.

8. Amount of pedestrians/vehicles
The first one makes sense, because having cars run over random people is too GTA-esque, but it definitely takes away from the realism: the city just feels empty. The second is a blessing and a curse: there are very few vehicles, but they only seem to spawn in places inconvenient to you. Trying to pass that stupid Mustang in a night race? G35 spawns right in front of you and you crash right into it head on! The cars will spawn in discreetly, i.e. around a corner, but they just serve as inconveniences most of the time. The diversity of NPC vehicles are also very lacking, there's basically 4 in total. All I really see are a G35, BMW 3-series, some pickup truck, and an ambulance.

While the strong points of this game are there, a lot of smaller issues also exist with it as well. This game was really nostalgic since it appealed to my childhood playing arcade racing games at Funway. As a car enthusiast, I had a lot of fun with this game so far and I'm eager to put even more hours into it. My experience was good, but the issues were things that temporarily distracted me from my enjoyment of the game. I can see why they would be bigger for other people and cause them to dislike the game.
Also grab this on sale if you can, I got it during the Open Worlds sale for like $14 and that's so much better than the exorbitant retail price of $70. I'd say this game is worth $60 max. This game is also from EA, so you have to install Origin on your computer (if you don't have it already). Origin has been heavily criticized and is incredibly slow, so be mindful of that."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"i thought i could trust the reviews for this game but i was wrong. the game is decent enough to be better than payback; they settled for decent rather than polishing some of the genuinely good mechanics it was going for. generic formula good enough to please the low standards of current NFS fans.

music is garbage and for a racing game their car assets look mediocre. always raining. we get it, you added misting and dynamic puddles."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"I paid 19 EUR for this game as part of a bundle with NFS Hot Pursuit Remastered. Since they seem to be evenly priced otherwise I'll judge it as if I've paid 9.50 EUR for it alone.

Long story short... not even close to worth it. I went in with very low expectations since I'm familiar with Ghost's previous work and even I was taken back by just how bad this game is.


GRAPHICS & PERFORMANCE:

- It's very poorly optimized... like, very, very poorly optimized. It even lags during the pre-rendered cutscenes. Lowering most of the graphics settings makes absolutely no difference performance wise, only the supersampling does.
- Takes a very long time to load, we're talking GTA5 loading times here, on an SSD.
- No dynamic time of day, despite the fact that the previous game (as well as pretty much every open world game made after 2015) has it.
- Car damage was downgraded from the previous games, which is a shame because it was quite good.
- Way too much teal, this is a problem that's plagued Frostbite for years but Ghost actually seemed to have fixed it in the previous game, now it's back with a vengeance.

+ Car models look great... at least on the outside.
+ Doesn't ask you to restart the game when changing graphics options.
+ Whereas other recent-ish games downscale the graphics to improve performance, NFS Heat actually gives you that option. It's too bad most of us will be forced to use it anyway, but it's nice that it exists.
+ Despite the horrendous performance the game does look quite crisp, even when downscaled to 75%.


AUDIO:

- Car sounds are pretty mediocre, they're unique to each car for the most part but none of them are anything to write home about. The sound tuning mechanic is ambitious but doesn't seem to actually affect the sound that much.
- Soundtrack is terrible, literally just sounds like the lead sound engineer just pasted his Spotify playlist into it and called it a day.
- Very buggy, car sounds cutting out briefly is quite common.
- Voice acting makes Undercover look like Citizen Kane.


CONTROLS:

- Much like it's predecessors it features virtually NO mouse support aside from moving the camera around in the garage, that's it.
- Hands down the worst keyboard driving controls I've ever seen in a driving game of any kind, even Flatout 3 driving is better, let that sink in.


SINGLEPLAYER:

+ Bodywork customization is alright, not nearly as ambitious as Underground 2 or Carbon but it's pretty decent.

- Paint customization has been dowgraded from the previous games, the material editor was replaced with pre-made materials which offer a bit more variety but cannot be used on vinyls.
- Performance customization has a lot of options, including engine swaps. However they are all linear upgrades, it's not like Forza where you have to pick & mix your parts carefully depending on the class or type of race, here the highest level parts/engines are always meta.
- The story is mediocre, which is probably the worst thing you can say about it. Since it's neither good enough to be memorable nor bad enough to be funny, it's just... meh.
- The day/night switching mechanic is unnecessary and only limits gameplay. Also feels more like an excuse for not featuring a dynamic time cycle.
- The driving physics are virtually non-existent. Also it reverted back to the NFS15 style of brake-to-drift mechanic, meaning that your car starts drifting whenever it wants to. This is a problem Payback did not have.
- The police AI is copy-pasted from Payback except they appear in free roam now, which would be great if it weren't for the addition of a health bar that cuts your chase short if you even think about having any fun.


MULTIPLAYER:

- No text chat.
- Matchmaking is quite poor, though not nearly as bad as Forza Horizon 4's.


OTHER:

- Car list is poor, it's also copy-pasted from Payback with barely any new cars, except now they've added like 3 - 4 variants of each. They did bring back Ferrari though, for what it's worth... which isn't much given that none of the cars in this game really drive like cars.
- Sticks ads and political messaging in your face when you're in the main menu.
- It has a very short life expectancy considering the DRM it uses, the fact that EA already ended support for it, the fact that Ghost is on the chopping block AND the fact that it didn't have that many players to begin with.
- EA


If you're itching for an arcade racing game get Forza Horizon 4, you'll likely pay a lot more but it looks, sounds and plays a lot better... when the servers are working at least."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"Did you know you can't even remap your controller in this game? Even after over 10 years of developing driving games, you're stuck with one controller layout the entire game. *claps*"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,best game
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"EA Origin messed up loading of the game. Can' even boot in, how am I suppose to play this. I believe this is a good game buy optimize your origin better. I""m out"
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"If you have Forza Horizon 4 don't buy this, plus the music if awful."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"First NFS i played? NFS III. Last one i played before Heat? Rivals.
Other racing games i played recently: The crew 2, Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally 2.0, Project Cars 2 and Forza Motorsport 7.


This game feels like a downgrade from Rivals. Not in all aspects, tho 

where it goes right:

-It is challenging, opponents and pursuits can give you a run for your money.
-It's straightforward (most NFS games are)
-You can customize your car to levels lost in NFSU2
-Car variety.

But It also borks a lot of things:

Characters and voice overs are lame, not as lame as payback, but that was never NFS strong point after MW 2005. Soundtrack is quite forgettable, 
The inability to disable the tap throttle do drift thing is utterly annoying, I don't wanna drift in every damn corner, handling in general feels stiff and quite heavy.
City seems post apocalyptic, everything seems dead, even the very low traffic density reinforces that idea.
Graphics for some reason are okay, even maxing everything out on ultra, it doesn't seem/feel like a 2019/2020 game.

If you wanna some fun, don't wanna anything complex and only like cars, get NFS Heat (or warez rivals, since the official system is borked), If you like a pickup and play racing game with variety, Get the Crew 2. IF you like realism, you're in the wrong place, pal.

I'm refunding this one, i guess i had too high hopes ot this isn't simply my cup of tea.

Not worth the full price, get it on sale."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,Car so fast I got pulled over in real life !
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"[h1]Short description:[/h1] Only buy it if you like good graphics, cars and customization and the game is on sale.

[h1]Long description:[/h1]
I really love car customization games, and this game has [b]a lot of options[/b] I appreciate. You can make [u]your own designs[/u] and there are [u]crazy paint options[/u] for many hours of editing. It still has some flaws; you cannot make a group of decals, or save a group of decals to save it and use it in multiple designs, lack of decal navigation shortcuts (these features are present in Forza games). 

Speaking about gameplay, the driving mechanics are pretty basic and arcade (as expected). But there is one thing I did not like: a [b]horrible double-tap to drift[/b] on the gas pedal button. This was a game breaker for me, in my opinion, one of the worst ideas ever implemented, but maybe people liked it, maybe it is just not my taste.

Another con is that [b][u]you CANNOT remap controller keys[/u][/b]. Even having an official Xbox One controller, I had to use the great Steam controller configuration for my buttons to do what I want. Honestly this is a super scumbag idea. Not sure if this is a rocket science thing or something you cannot integrate in the game engine, but c'mon, this is a basic game feature.

About the police when they chase you, man, that thing is brutal. Be careful when you race at night. I have not played too much in the night but last time I tried, the cop cars felt like damn ferrari indestructible tanks.

Also you may have trouble when starting up the game, because EA Origin and EA Desktop are not the same and present problems when you start the game and they are both active. You will have to close EA Desktop and leave EA Origin open to start the game. 

If at this point,  playing NFS Heat still sounds good to you, then I'm pretty sure you will enjoy the game."
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,its fun and hard
Need for Speed™ Heat,Racing,1222680,"I wanted to have my nostalgia moment with this arcade racer but NFS heat does not quite feel like any former NSF game.

The story was cringe and the game only has 20 or so soundtracks all of which do not appeal to me, to say it lightly.
The open world racing aspect I didn't really notice it felt mostly empty with maybe 1/3 player visible on the map in a 1h span.

Graphics are great and it ran smoothly.

Would recommend only for NSF hardcore fans"

Inertial Drift,Racing,1184480,"Incredibly interesting driving mechanics. The way every car handles entirely differently gives you a large amount of content to actually explore. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes slick semi-arcadey driving, and/or Initial D fans!"
Inertial Drift,Racing,1184480,Definitely Fun! I was one of the first round of purchased players because the trailer/preview gave me those classic arcade style Initial D vibes :) I feel like it can be somewhat repetitive but given that its a racing game that makes sense. I do like the twin stick drifting idea but in practice it has some drawbacks this making this more of an Arcade Racer than anything else. But for some quick and dirty fun its perfect.
Inertial Drift,Racing,1184480,Fantastic driving/drifting game. Would recommend to play on a controller. Would like if the online and friends features in the game were more current and easier to navigate.
Inertial Drift,Racing,1184480,Good drift mechanics with high skill ceiling

Inertial Drift,Racing,1184480,Fantastic driving/drifting game. Would recommend to play on a controller. Would like if the online and friends features in the game were more current and easier to navigate.
Inertial Drift,Racing,1184480,Good drift mechanics with high skill ceiling
Motorsport Manager,Sports,415200,"I can't really stand to watch car racing, but this game is absolutely addictive and fun. It took a little while to figure out how everything works, and several restarts. There are lots of YouTube videos and other resources online to learn the game through. I'm now enjoying moving up the ranks with my custom team. Lots of fun yet to experience and I already have 334 hours in the game! I really enjoy the strategy of both building up your team/cars and managing the races. Even though this isn't a recent release, it's much better than many of the games out these days. I highly recommend this game if you are into strategy/managing type games."

Trackmania United Forever,Racing,7200,lots of fun to compete against yourself. I've found myself turning to this game more often than some of the more modern titles in my library due to just how enjoyable it is
Trackmania United Forever,Racing,7200,c:

Trackmania United Forever,Racing,7200,"Easily the best Trackmania game out there. While trying to get friends to play the game is hard, the Singleplayer campaign tracks are pretty fun, in fact that's the most competitive part of the community. People are always fighting for the world record on every track. It's insane.

This is the paid version. You can play 6 other environments if you don't enjoy Stadium. There's also a different campaign that includes all those environments, plus 4 modes. Race, Platform, Stunts and Puzzle.
Race: Complete the track within a time limit to earn a medal.
Platform: Complete the track with the least amount of respawns.
Stunts: Earn points from performing stunts to earn a medal.
Puzzle: Finish the track in the Track Editor with a limited amount of blocks, then complete the track within a time limit to earn a medal.

There's also Star Tracks which were from a competition held by Nadeo on the TM-Exchange website.
If you wanted to create a Trackmania campaign, you can with My Campaign. You can create tracks for flag series in the 4 United modes at your free will.

If Singleplayer isn't your taste, there is also Multiplayer. Online has several gamemodes.
Time Attack: Like Singleplayer, compete for the fastest time.
Rounds: Get the highest amount of points in several rounds on the same map. Pressing your Give Up button will set you as DNF and you spectate for the rest of the round.
Team Rounds: Same as regular Rounds, but with teams. Basically Trackmania 2020's ranked mode.
Laps: Compete in a standard multi-lap track without resetting your time. Literally every racing game ever.
Cup: Compete a series of several race maps. Get the highest amount of points to win.
Stunts: Only for United players, get the highest points without resetting to win.
If you buy Trackmania United Forever, you will have no restrictions on the amount of races you play before spectating the 5th track. This is called FreeZone.
Other players can see your custom skins, unlike Nations Forever.

You can download skins and tracks in ManiaLink with coppers. You can get coppers by booting up the game daily or by entering player keys."

TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"Remember playing it 7-8 years ago,was awesome.Now game is pretty dead,and they did a Freezone...I would totally recommend it,if not Freezone.That means you can play 5 tracks,and you MUST spectate one race.And if you want to upgrade to unlimited version you must pay 20-30 euro for a game that is dying and is 9 years old.Well if it would be 5 euro,I dont mind to pay,but 30 euro on steam is WAY to much.Still with friends its fun.Try it,maybe you will like it."
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"I've logged somewhere close to 1000 hours on this before finding it on steam. The online community is hit or miss, but the single player campaign is fantastic. Get a couple of friends, and get ready to fight for that last .001 of a second so you can win. Stupid physics, stupid speeds, fucking amazing fun levels."
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"im mostly doing this coz of the background music..... but seriously, this game is very addictive. gameplay is very well done, and man the background music is good. Original price for the complete pack is a little over the top imo, but if you do have that much to spare, go for it. I wouldn't regret it ."
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,this game is good and the type of game is a race. Can ride on all kinds of fertilizers and other developed or their routes. Can create their machines and map. And a good game.
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,TrakMania Nations Forever is a very salty game with much salt
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"This is one of the best games i ever played especially when i was young... Free to Play and Free to Win, you cant get bored of this game when you have UNLIMITED TRACKS , the race editor is a genius idea if you are creative and have imagination.
The only bad thing is that you have to wait an entire race in multiplayer as a spectator to continue playing but it is not a problem for me.
I really recommend this game for thoose who loves f2p racing games with stunts..."
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,wicked fast!!!!!!!!!!!! want speed? This games for you!
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"Some limitations with the free acount, but there is a lot of customizability with the car appearance wise (not model-wise). If you want a realistic racing experience, this is not it. If you want a wacky arcade racer, then this is one of the best. It still has a lot of servers running. There are a lot of cool puzzle racing maps people have made. You can have massive races. Also theres a more traditional single player. Cheers to TrackMania."

TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,Really cool game needs improvement tho!
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,This game is good.
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"Let me get this straight, the game itself isn't bad, it's the online that really bugs me. You have to spectate one in every five games unless you pay £20. You can't play with friends either. Or go on certain servers.

It's so restricted that it's probably worth paying a fiver or so and getting trackmania 2 stadium or canyon as you will be able to play without the annoying restrictions.

It says in the game description that it's a 'truly free to play game'. It just isn't."
TrackMania Nations Forever,Racing,11020,"It is the absolute best free to play racing game.
Not only does it have many levels which are outrageous
it also has a level editor which allows you to make your own tracks 
the level editting is very simple and great.

art of rally,Sports,550320,"The driving is hard to get the hang of at first, but it's fun to learn and improve. All the cars handle differently adding more depth to the driving, as well a different road surfaces and weather effects.
Overall a casual, fun game that presents enough challenge to be engaging, but not too much that it's frustrating to learn and play. The music is also great.

8/10"
art of rally,Sports,550320,"I've been playing since around 1.10 and the game has only gotten better and better the more I play. The achievements and car unlocks are fun and challenging, and flow well with the main campaign. This is my first ever racing game and I found myself having fun through every stage of progression, from learning how to maintain a drift, to mastering trail-braking, it's rewarding every step of the way. Only at 200+ hours am I running out of things to do in game, but (at the time of writing) luckily the Kenya Update is soon around the corner. I joined the Funselektor Discord soon after purchase, and the community has been incredible. From beginning tips, optimal setting adjustments, and sharing custom liveries, the community surrounding this game has helped tremendously. I seriously can't recommend this game enough, 10/10 experience all the way through."
art of rally,Sports,550320,"It's the essence of the DIRT rally series but without all the fat. 

This is rally as raw as it gets. Primary focus is driving physics. What matters most is the connection you build to the car that feels best to you. From that point on it's a journey. You master different szenarios with slowly increasing in difficulties (track layout, track material, weather). Progression comes as your skill increases. Once you mastered the ""basics"" you will do it again – but faster this time. Faster means more powerful cars and stronger opponents. At this point let me say this game is not casual and not for everyone. You need that certain mindest to put yourself through it. But if you have that mindset and you like cars: do not hesitate. Just buy it. It's worth it."
art of rally,Sports,550320,"Amazing arcade!

9.98 of 10:
- 0.01 for weird collision system
- 0.01 for weird rain physic

PS: I wait for Kenia SO MUCH"
art of rally,Sports,550320,"A top down rally game like nothing else on the market at the moment. The graphics are very bright and colourful, the maps are well made and have plenty of variety in the straights,jumps,corners,camber,uphill and downhill sections. The game never gets boring plenty of content and cars to unlock in career mode.Plenty of other mode;s to mess around in too. Highly recommended game with hours and hours of game play."
art of rally,Sports,550320,"Bought this game on a whim, just because how it looked and was not disappointed.
Now, I'm not really a racing fan having only played one or two older Need for Speed games - so I can't speak from the point of view of someone who knows a lot about racing games. And I won't.
Instead I'll review this from the point of view of someone who wanted a simple racing game to play once in a while. And I can say that I got what I wanted.

What I liked:
- looks really good. I like this type of minimalist low poly look and I think it works well with how minimalist the gameplay is
- simple gameplay. Pick a game mode, pick a car and drive. Nothing is distracting you from the actual core of the game - driving.
- realistic. Or what I imagine driving in real life is like. Every car feels different, every type of terrain feels different and it took me some time to learn how not to fly off the road on every turn. (Small tip: set transmission to manual in settings. Doing this gave me more control and made driving easier)
- music. I wouldn't listen to this OST on it's own, but it works really well with the game

What I think could've been better:
- my results info. When you finish a race you are given info like (5410 | 50%). Maybe it's just me but it's not clear what these numbers actually mean. I wish there was a tooltip or something with explanation for this
- map in free roam. When in free roam and looking for collectables I end up pressing Esc way too often and it breaks the immersion. I think it would be great if there was a setting to display a map in free roam mode.

To conclude, I think this game is great for someone who wants a pretty game to just drive and not be distracted by irrelevant tuning, carrer or other mechanics"
art of rally,Sports,550320,"Simple and relaxing driving game for everybody. Cheap, fun, replayable. Enough cars to satisfy every classic era rally car enjoyer.  What's not to like?"
art of rally,Sports,550320,"A top-down rally game that's both soothing and exciting. The soundtrack and visual style compliment each other well, not to mention the well made physics."
art of rally,Sports,550320,"This Game is just a Loveletter to Car-Enthusiasts.

-It looks beautiful
-its really fun and authentic to drive
-most of the cars sound good.  i dont like some of them, but i also really love a few of them.
-the soundtrack is great

-the only bad thing i could say about art of rally is the highest difficulty. it could be a bit more punishing for my taste.
there are leaderboards though, if you really want to push yourself.

Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"I would recommend only because I have some fun moments with it, but to be honest, the awful physics, the many times that you will lose just because a branch of a tree just get in the way of your visual and the lack of consistency on to give the idea to where you could or couldnt go, its frustrating. And to make it worse, if you play the levels on the dailies you will find that they dont work well, IDk how to explain it those levels doesnt feel right! they feel so broken than many times you would quit them just out of rage ."
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"This is a little gem. It's a racing game but also one about discovery and relaxation.
The ambiance is great."
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"I know I am writing this review far too late, but this is one of my favorite games in the last 5 years.
I enjoyed every inch of the game and became really obsessive about it.
I also started RL Mountainbiking partially because of this.
Thanks for this experience and all the challenges"
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"This is the perfect game for me. If you want a game you can play if you want to wind down or do something on the side while watching a video, this game is for you. If you want a game that continuously challenges you, without feeling grindy or tedious, this is the game for you. If you want a game that never frustrates you even through the challenge, this game is for you.

It's a simple concept executed through simple design, but executed flawlessly 10/10"
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"It's fun and pretty but incredibly buggy and inconsistent especially relating to crashing. Kinda weird checkpoint spots too, terrain being polygons definitely inhibits gameplay.

bump into a tree at 2mph: blood everywhere
fall down a 100ft drop onto rock: totally fine and safe
fall down a 50 ft drop onto rock: no now ur dead haha fuck you"
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"Elegantly simple, yet satisfyingly complex. From casual and scenic to dangerous and unforgiving, this game has an immense lure that will keep you hooked for hours at a time. A healthy speedrun community and a very friendly development team manage to bring vibes of a multiplayer experience to an otherwise singleplayer game."

If you want a game that never frustrates you even through the challenge, this game is for you.

It's a simple concept executed through simple design, but executed flawlessly 10/10"
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"It's fun and pretty but incredibly buggy and inconsistent especially relating to crashing. Kinda weird checkpoint spots too, terrain being polygons definitely inhibits gameplay.

bump into a tree at 2mph: blood everywhere
fall down a 100ft drop onto rock: totally fine and safe
fall down a 50 ft drop onto rock: no now ur dead haha fuck you"
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"Elegantly simple, yet satisfyingly complex. From casual and scenic to dangerous and unforgiving, this game has an immense lure that will keep you hooked for hours at a time. A healthy speedrun community and a very friendly development team manage to bring vibes of a multiplayer experience to an otherwise singleplayer game."
Lonely Mountains: Downhill,Sports,711540,"very fun, and reasonably realistic"
Distance,Racing,233610,"Visually stunning, great with music, and fantastic performance in VR. I always find myself coming back to Distance when I just want to get lost on the road in a different dimension."
Distance,Racing,233610,"Great Game, EXTREMELY Hard, yet EXTREMELY Fair. The Mess ups feel like they're your fault, and the Skill Ceiling is one of the highest I've ever seen. Definitely one of the hardest games I've ever played."
Distance,Racing,233610,definitely worth your money. Even if you only play through it once.

Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"This game is dangerous. 

When I first started playing I was like, ""It's cool, farming is fun but I don't really see the hype around it."" 

Then I kept playing.

It's gotten so bad that I have 10 tabs open just to look up stuff on the wiki for this game. I open the game and blink and two hours have passed, and while I feel sad that I just lost so much time, I look at the progress I made on my farm and think, ""Worth."" 

This is one of the most fun games I've ever played.

It's designed in such a way that it allows both casual players and competitive / optimization-oriented players to have a blast with this game. There is so much to do in this game, and there's so much to offer. You can spend your days farming, fishing, mining, foraging, talking to the villagers, etc. The game is made in a way in which you don't have to hyper-optimize every little detail like min-maxing profit, time management, etc, because there's no time limit for things (unless you count seasons, but there's always another year) and there's no stakes. But if you want to, you definitely can. 

Talking to the villagers is fun as well, they're well-designed, and you can even find patterns in their daily schedules. There's a lot of details in this game.

I haven't tried the multiplayer, but from what I've seen it can definitely be a lot more fun with friends. But playing solo is extremely fun as well.

My only gripe with the game is that it's a huge time sink. I waited until my semester was over to get into it because I heard about the time sink beforehand, and I was glad I waited, because all I can think about now is, ""What crops am I going to plant next season? Where I should place them? How much money am I making from these? Should I fish or mine? Did I feed my animals today? DID I TALK TO ROBIN TODAY?"" 

And of course, Robin is best girl, no discussion there."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"this game has got me through many hard times, it's incredibly sweet and it feels like there are an endless amount of goals and things to do, plus so many different ways to play. will probably never get tired of it <3"

It is one of the most fantastic, relaxing, open world gameplay experiences you will ever play in your life.  And one wouldn't know that by simply looking at the games graphics alone.  Stardew Valley is how a game should be made!"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"Married the town alcoholic, it was the happiest marriage in all my gameplay attempts. 10/10 love u shane"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"There are not enough words to describe how fantastic this game is.
Just want to farm? Sure!
Want to fight monsters and mine rocks? Great!
Want to hang out with the townspeople and fall in love? Yes!
Want to go fishing? By all means!
Like to explore and forage? Excellent!
This game is easy to learn and will keep you busy for hours. There are so many things to do and you can relax and take your time. The music is beautiful - most games I usually turn music down or mute it but not this game. NPC's are interesting and all have their own stories.
The game price is excellent value and all extra content has been free. And the amount of content in this game is staggering. The developer really cares about his game and fans which is really nice.

This is easily one of my favorite games of all time. I definitely recommend it - to everybody!"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"i play this game with my friend ricky who i am deeply in love with. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is also in love with their best friend and wants to start a farm with them, adopt a cat & sleep in the same bed as them. 
the only downside is that i now have crippling attachment issues. i dont know. maybe i always had those."

Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"I played this game with my girlfriend and my 2 side chicks. We all had a great time during the game, but halfway through playing it my girlfriend started questioning me about where these 2 other girls came from. I told her there was nothing going on between me and the 2 other girls and that they are just here to play the game with us because they are also my friends. Thinking that my girlfriend would be satisfied with the answer, I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that I can keep playing this game with my girlfriend and my 2 side chicks. But I thought wrong, my girlfriend proceeded to fence me in my house and when I confronted her about why, she said that there is no space on our farm for cheating men. Thanks to this game, I'm pretty sure my girlfriend now loves me even more and I also love her even more. Our relationship levels definitely have increased, and my side chicks are now best friends with my girlfriend too. I wonder why they never invite me to go out with them anymore though..."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"I have this game on my Laptop, Switch, and Phone and still I am not bored of it. It is an amazing game that I love so much and everytime you play through it, you can play it differently. Whether it's the partner you choose, the farm you decide to start on, or if you rather focus on fishing or mining. 10/10 for me. A great casual game to play that's easy on any device."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,my comfort video game <3
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"A phenomenal game, great for hours upon hours of fun, alone or with friends. A great soundtrack with charming graphics and characters. Let's get farming!"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,I feel that 950 hours played speaks for itself.
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"Such a quaint, charming little game. A perfect time waster with surprisingly immersive writing that makes you genuinely care about your fellow townsfolk. I picked this up late December of 2020, deep into quarantine, and didn’t put it back down until I had done essentially every possible thing the game offered. It’s addicting, satisfyingly repetitive (if that makes any sense), with a laundry list of fun game mechanics and mini games outside of the game’s main farming aspect."

Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"I have this game on my Laptop, Switch, and Phone and still I am not bored of it. It is an amazing game that I love so much and everytime you play through it, you can play it differently. Whether it's the partner you choose, the farm you decide to start on, or if you rather focus on fishing or mining. 10/10 for me. A great casual game to play that's easy on any device."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,my comfort video game <3
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"A phenomenal game, great for hours upon hours of fun, alone or with friends. A great soundtrack with charming graphics and characters. Let's get farming!"
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,I feel that 950 hours played speaks for itself.
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"Such a quaint, charming little game. A perfect time waster with surprisingly immersive writing that makes you genuinely care about your fellow townsfolk. I picked this up late December of 2020, deep into quarantine, and didn’t put it back down until I had done essentially every possible thing the game offered. It’s addicting, satisfyingly repetitive (if that makes any sense), with a laundry list of fun game mechanics and mini games outside of the game’s main farming aspect."
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,YAS just so yasss
Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,VERY FUN AND CHILL GAME. REALLY NICE WHEN PLAYING WITH SOMEONE :D

Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,"So I played the game for 100 hours so I could get an honest review of it instead of playing it for 5 and saying it is trash or not playing it enough for me to notice it's critique. I will compare this game to other RPG's or similar games. If you want a summary of this review I will write it at the bottom of this review along with the reviews of the DLC's but on to the start. 

INTRODUCTION: My Fallout Experience (the 1000 word essay) on how this game is great

We have all heard of ""Fallout New Vegas"" and I, as many others have been taught or shown across the internet is that this is the definitive best fallout game. So after some time I decided to get the game with all it's DLC's and decided that I would check out the game and see if all the hype was concrete or was just fallout fans with rose tinted glasses.

I start of with installing and starting the game and realizing that it is completely uncompatable with windows 10. This may be on Bethesda's part as I know fallout 3 has this exact issue as well. So my journey begins in the mod manager and .ini files to enable more memory usage. But after these fixes the game only crashed twice throughout my whole 100 hour playthrough. 
(The mods included in my mod list have no effect on the game but only made it crash less and fix memory usage)

So I start of with an amazing introduction to the main factions and the story taking place in Fallout New Vegas from the get go by a aged but still good cinematic. Comparing it to the Fallout 4 cinematic I would say this one introduces alot more of the world to the player compared to the black and white war scene all about ""war never changes"". I start of the game with making my character. In comparison to other RPG's like Skyrim (or Fallout 4) this game truly gave you the tools to make your own character. Everything from the wacky dialogue options to actual things that could impact your gameplay is decided from what S.P.E.C.I.A.L points, skills and perks you picked. This really made it feel like your decisions mattered from the get go. So I get on my mary way out on to the Majave wasteland and instantly get hit with this massive world to explore but I follow a long the main story and talk to ""Easy Pete"" and get introduced to these amazing dialogue options. Comparing it to other Bethesda games they were truly fleshed out and you could totally make sense of the conversation when you could actually read a sentance that your character would say instead of a few words or ""yes"" and ""no"".

At this point I also get introduced to the Karma system where bad and good actions could impact your late game stats. As I get hit with these intrequet systems that I would say are pretty overwhelming if you don't expect it or are not used to RPG's or other roleplaying games I also discover the grave sight and see a grave. You can dig a grave but only if you have a shovel, so I go to the little ponsy shop in Goodsprings right next to the grave sight and buy a shovel. With this I had made an impact on my  gameplay through my choices and ended up with a laser rifle. A mid game weapon at level 2. When this happened I knew I was gonna have a good time with this game. I made my way and thought I would make my way to the big glowing tower that is the ""Lucky 38"" and boy did I get turned into shreds by those deathclaws. Facing the strongest enemy in the game and it not feeling like a cake walk like in a later released fallout game. It showed me where my place was which was killing powder gangers and thugs after I got my ass beat by every abomination I came across. It set a milestone for me to get through that valley and kill those radscorpions that plagued me when I left goodsprings. The game made me feel like I was in for a journey, a journey that was mine to make and my choices mattered. Here the characters, the voice acting, the effects. They were lasting and they did change the story for my character which made the game so much more enjoyable. 

After my introductions to the game as a whole I got to know the factions in the game a little more and if I were to summarize them I would describe them as such. The Legion are the ""bad guys"" who are misogynistic, dog fucking, twink boy-toy slave owners that base themselves on the ideals of the roman enthusiast Ceasar. Then we have the NCR (New Californian Republic) the ""good guys"" who traveled into New Vegas to help the citizens and by ""help"" they mean help the areas with recources they need.

SUMMARY: 

GAMEPLAY:
The game held up to the expectations I was expecting which was shocking as I went into the game thinking ""this game is the best RPG I have ever played"". But it truly is the best RPG I have ever played and the best RPG on my game list. I love all the elements of this game and how your actions can impact the games surroundings and that your choices matter for the story and in general gameplay.

COMBAT:
The gun play is simple yes, yet satisfying and a lot of perks you learn compliment the experience. Melee is simple and don't involve more complex combat except block and swing but it is satisfying turning a ghoul's head into mash potatoe. 

STORY:
The main story has a simple premise but has complex solutions as you can shape the ending of the game however you deem fit which is something truly rare in games these days. Even story telling games don't dwell into your choices mattering this much for the outcome of the story.

SOUND/MUSIC:
If you don't turn on the radio in this game you are truly missing out on some bangers I am telling ya, but seriously the sound design in this game is as everything else truly masterful. You will have to explore the vaults and everything else with it's matching soundtrack that either puts shivers down your spine, makes you enticipate what combat scenario is next or makes you jam in out in the lobby halls of the casinos.

GRAPHICS:
Now this game is 10 years old so I didn't wanna slack on it too hard but even some games that came out the following year looked a lot better than this. But the graphics are not too bad, they are still good especially by 2010 standards and give more of a Fallout feeling to it all. Something about the graphical design of New Vegas just give more of a rustic run down wasteland sort of feeling with its orange tones but that might just be me.

DLC'S:
I really enjoyed 3/4 DLC's which were. Old World Blues, Honest Hearts, Lonesome Road. If you are playing New Vegas these DLC's are a must play in my opinion as they are truly great DLC's. Dead Money on the other hand did not hit home for me as many others. But if you like dialogues with character building and clues of a mystery to solve and puzzles I can see how you would enjoy this DLC as well.

ARCHITECHTURE:
The buildings just look great, you know what they are supposed to be and in what conditions. You know what buildings stand out and which ones you can enter apart from some instances.

THE BAD:
Now there are alot of great things with this game that is for sure, like how great the RPG elements are and so on. But there is a few bad things, like how the game isn't functional from the get go and that you have to manually fix it. There is also the landscape which has some unique parts like red rock canyon and the area around the strip that look notorious and when you are there you know exactly where you are. But a part from those specific places all the other 60~% look the same but that is the only concern I had when playing apart from some bugs and the two instances of crashes.

Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,"Everyone knows that you should play this game. Watch Hbomberguy's video if you want to know all the fantastic mechanics and storytelling in NV, he has 2 hours that I do not."
Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,"If you can't bear hours of backstory dialogue or get madder than a bull seeing red when the game mysteriously disappears, I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise, welcome, you've made it to a goldmine of RPGs.

Here out in the Mojave, you are a Courier and are free to follow your own path, do your own thing. For example, in no particular order:

- Shoot gangs.
- Shoot gangs for other gangs.
- Tell people that you'd like to see their wares.
- Gamble with people's lives in the name of peace or law and order.
- Gamble literally.
- Gamble with your reputation as you balance mercy and vengeance on the fly.
- Lose all of your caps at the place that's not Sodom.
- Quench your thirst with more than just purified water.
- Escape a crumbling treasure vault to the ramblings of an old man.
- Aid the remnants of a fascist, paramilitary organization.
- Aid a whole charity, humanitarian organization.
- Help a face on a TV screen achieve regional domination.
- Hit said face with a 9 iron in the name of a bear or a bull.
- Destroy a robot dog created by some robot scientist with your... I can't say, sorry. They're on your hands and feet, that's all I am allowed to tell you.
- Self-destruct a bunker because you wanted to put them all on crosses but couldn't so you went with the next best option.
- Stray away from the road towards a crashed retro-futuristic helicopter and almost wish for a nuclear winter.
- Learn to use endgame armor only to realize you're still not invincible to living science experiments; the hard way.
- Let a monorail get destroyed because of your loose lips.
- Take advantage of someone else's loose lips in order to take over Vegas.
- Jury-rig a few heaps of electric parts to a heap of metal to create the hands-down best companion you will ever meet.
- Cement ""the Butcher"" to Ulysses S. Grant's reputation for eternity, albeit with a different surname.
- Watch a team of pseudo-adventurers get massacred by a giant scorpion in a firehouse.
- Watch a group of ghouls re-enact Jonestown... by accident. I think.
- Get paid for having someone else's hat.
- Get paid for collecting special caps.
- Demand better payment for collecting said caps.
- Get paid for doing your job.
- Forget you had a job by taking another.
- Destroy everything with nothin' but a hound dog. This one won't make you feel so blue.
- Destroy entire families and factions.
- Turn on the radio because the vault was getting too scary.
- Turn it back off for the immersion.
- Persuade away your problems, shoot them, punch through them, let them sizzle out, fake them out. Or forget about them.

I think you get the idea. Beyond the crashing, pitiful combat, and quest bugs that are funny yet annoying, is still quite a gem of PC gaming. The ways you can play this game, and still have fun, are nearly endless. And each of those times, you'll find a couple of details you glossed over in the previous playthrough. Now that's a sign of a great piece of media right there. Helps me to... turn a blind eye to its crashaholic tendencies.

So come on, what are you waiting for? Can't expect God to do all the work, now can we?"

Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,"Everyone knows that you should play this game. Watch Hbomberguy's video if you want to know all the fantastic mechanics and storytelling in NV, he has 2 hours that I do not."
Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,"If you can't bear hours of backstory dialogue or get madder than a bull seeing red when the game mysteriously disappears, I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise, welcome, you've made it to a goldmine of RPGs.

Here out in the Mojave, you are a Courier and are free to follow your own path, do your own thing. For example, in no particular order:

- Shoot gangs.
- Shoot gangs for other gangs.
- Tell people that you'd like to see their wares.
- Gamble with people's lives in the name of peace or law and order.
- Gamble literally.
- Gamble with your reputation as you balance mercy and vengeance on the fly.
- Lose all of your caps at the place that's not Sodom.
- Quench your thirst with more than just purified water.
- Escape a crumbling treasure vault to the ramblings of an old man.
- Aid the remnants of a fascist, paramilitary organization.
- Aid a whole charity, humanitarian organization.
- Help a face on a TV screen achieve regional domination.
- Hit said face with a 9 iron in the name of a bear or a bull.
- Destroy a robot dog created by some robot scientist with your... I can't say, sorry. They're on your hands and feet, that's all I am allowed to tell you.
- Self-destruct a bunker because you wanted to put them all on crosses but couldn't so you went with the next best option.
- Stray away from the road towards a crashed retro-futuristic helicopter and almost wish for a nuclear winter.
- Learn to use endgame armor only to realize you're still not invincible to living science experiments; the hard way.
- Let a monorail get destroyed because of your loose lips.
- Take advantage of someone else's loose lips in order to take over Vegas.
- Jury-rig a few heaps of electric parts to a heap of metal to create the hands-down best companion you will ever meet.
- Cement ""the Butcher"" to Ulysses S. Grant's reputation for eternity, albeit with a different surname.
- Watch a team of pseudo-adventurers get massacred by a giant scorpion in a firehouse.
- Watch a group of ghouls re-enact Jonestown... by accident. I think.
- Get paid for having someone else's hat.
- Get paid for collecting special caps.
- Demand better payment for collecting said caps.
- Get paid for doing your job.
- Forget you had a job by taking another.
- Destroy everything with nothin' but a hound dog. This one won't make you feel so blue.
- Destroy entire families and factions.
- Turn on the radio because the vault was getting too scary.
- Turn it back off for the immersion.
- Persuade away your problems, shoot them, punch through them, let them sizzle out, fake them out. Or forget about them.

I think you get the idea. Beyond the crashing, pitiful combat, and quest bugs that are funny yet annoying, is still quite a gem of PC gaming. The ways you can play this game, and still have fun, are nearly endless. And each of those times, you'll find a couple of details you glossed over in the previous playthrough. Now that's a sign of a great piece of media right there. Helps me to... turn a blind eye to its crashaholic tendencies.

So come on, what are you waiting for? Can't expect God to do all the work, now can we?"
Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,the quests and story are very good. There are multiple ways to go about resolving pretty much any situation. The game does benefit greatly from quality of life mods but you will still have a great time with the vanilla game!

DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,hardest thing so far was holding back the tears after realizing you bought the game one day before a 75% sale
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,Love this game but right now on PC it needs to be patched there is too much hacking going on. just lost my progress due to hackers
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,Cute game
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"One of the greatest games ever made, following the footsteps of the first dark souls with improved animations, netcoding and general mechanics. This game feels very smooth and fights are absolutely amazing. Dark souls 3 adds more challenge to the game by making the mobs more aggressive, a lot like in BloodBorn. I absolutely want to recommend this game as a big fan of dark souls series and for the gameplay quality but due to it's state I can not do so, I feel like I have the responsibility to inform you about the situation that's going on in the game. 

Cheaters have taken over the game in large numbers, Dark souls has it's own brutal anti-cheat system but it is very ineffective when cheaters can create alt steam accounts to bypass bans and strike again. The cheating scene has been going on for years and years now but it has evolved to the point where cheaters can actually cause permanent damage to your PC or even pish information you'd not want to share online. These cheats are evolving constantly due to the big playerbase and lack of action from Bandai Namco. So who knows maybe in future Dark souls 3 on steam could work as a backdoor access to your PC in a way. Very high security risk here. I talked to Bandai Namco's support about the issue and they are aware of what is going on and I was told that they are working on the issue, but in truth nothing has been done in 3 years or so when all this started to boom.

If you play this game in OFFLINE mode you will not have any problems, also there are mods such as Blue-Sentinel which is telling you when you are being invaded by a cheater and it tries to block you connecting to them in future, use of this mod is bannable reason but Bandai Namco's anti-cheat can't track it as the mod does not affect the game itself that much. I recommend using this mod if you plan to play the game."
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Extremely good game, however, an ongoing issue yet to be fixed or remotely addressed is the issue with hacking. In the last month, several issues with player's game being completely hacked into with malicious code that not only lets them into your game, but also your hard drive, SSD and potentially more. Check out the reddit for this game and its pinned post or some of the negative reviews below for more info. Great game, but probably one of the worst instances of hacking in terms of severity I've ever seen from a mainstream game that's being completely ignored."

DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"I was subject to the new hack that reset all my save progress and sent me back to firelink shrine, trapping me there.
I had been loving the game and I had just spent the last 37 hours playing.

This security issue needs to be addressed before this game can be recommended again, this is a huge issue that could even cause GPU hacks and totally corrupt your PC.

VALVE ADDRESS THIS NOW, THIS GAME SHOULD BE PULLED FROM YOUR STORE UNTIL THIS IS ADDRESSED!!!

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!"
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Good game, but is PLAGUED with hackers that teleport, force instant death animations, prevent you from using separation crystal (forcing you to force close the game) and in other cases completely wiping ALL of your progress That's right, a hacker can invade you and simply erase countless hours of progress from your character. They can also force actions on your character that makes the game detect you as a cheater, penalizing you and BANNING you from online forever even though you didn't do anything. While this hasn't happened to me there are plenty of cases of it happening. I cannot recommend the game until this is handled properly by FromSoftware. A system where fair players get banned and hackers continue terrorizing the community is unacceptable."

DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Whilst I really like this game, I cannot recommend anyone buying it. There is a serious exploit making the rounds online that lets hackers mess up your save game really bad and Bamco and FromSoftware have been made aware of it a long time ago and they have chosen not to patch it. So unless you use 3rd party software to protect yourself from hackers, you are putting your save game to serious risk every time you engage in online play. Not to mention the plethora of older exploits and hacks that have not been patched. Fix your game From, this is not acceptable."
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"[i] “Yes, indeed. It is called Lothric, where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge. In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words: ""The fire fades and the lords go without thrones."" When the link of fire is threatened, the bell tolls, unearthing the old Lords of Cinder from their graves...Aldrich, Saint of the Deep... Farron's Undead Legion, the Abyss Watchers... And the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital, Yhorm the Giant... Only, in truth... the Lords will abandon their thrones... And the Unkindled will rise. Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers.” [/i]

I am a big Souls-Like fan thanks to Dark Souls III, the first game of the genre, and the series, that I have played. 
I have been planning on writing a review about this game for a long time now, but never found the perfect timing to do so. Now, that the game is having a discount, and probably there will be plenty of people coming to give it a look, I decided to write this review. 
Like I did with my Dark Souls: Remastered review on Steam, I will separate this review into 2 main parts: the Technical Aspect and the Story/Plot/Lore of the game. 

 [h1] Technical Aspect: [/h1]

Firstly, I would like to say that this game has not the same mechanics as Dark Souls I and Dark Souls II, they end up being faster-paced, and also a lot of hitboxes issues have been improved. With that said, due to the date of launch of the game, it’s is obviously getting better graphics and textures, 2 aspects that the previous games weren’t strong at. 
Being FromSoftware the company that we are talking about, the scenario, the ambiance and the designs are, of course, on the point and perfectly fit in each occasion of the game, giving the player the same immersion given on the other Soulsborne games. Being even more detailed on that aspect, places like High Wall of Lothric, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, The Ringed City, Archdragon Peak, and Kiln of the First Flame, will mostly pass to the player a feeling of astonishment due to the amazing landscapes and atmosphere that they have. While, on the other hand, there will be areas that will give the player the feeling of progression and curiosity about what is to come, like, Road of Sacrifices, Cathedral of the Deep, Farron Keep, Catacombs of Carthus, and actually most of the other places to visit. 
Just like Dark Souls I, areas in Dark Souls III like Archdragon Peak and Untended Graves will be hidden and will only be discovered with certain triggers. 
The music can be really amazing at some bosses, but at others, it can feel kind of boring, which is a negative trait when compared to Dark Souls I’s unique compositions by Motoi Sakuraba (that being only my opinion though). 
The combat mechanic varied a lot from the previous games to Dark Souls III. Now there are specific habilities and possible combinations with each weapon presented. It synthesized ideas presented before in the other previous games and ended up making a pleasurable result (and, as said before, faster-paced). 
Lastly, to conclude this topic, Dark Souls III is a game that will not feel somewhat tiring when compared to the other Dark Souls, it balances every aspect already mentioned and does an amazing job to entertain the player for the first run until how many times one will feel like to play it again and again and again (in my case, 4 runs have already been completed). 

 [h1] Story/Plot/Lore: [/h1]

It would be impossible to put together every piece of lore in a review, thus I will be summarizing the main plot.
Unkindled, the player is a composition of the ash from the once, fire-devoted, undead that has given itself to the flame, and its duty remains the same. 
The game starts off presenting that the “fire fades” and that the Lords go without thrones. Giving that we are in the same universe set by Dark Souls I and II, we are left with speculations until finally arrive at conclusions by progressing in the game. 
The whereabouts are the “same” as Dark Souls I… However, there are slightly different things that might give the idea of the passage of time. Hundreds, or perhaps, thousands of years have passed since the Age of Fire and mighty new Lords of Cinder have linked the fire to maintain it. Even though there are controversies on the “time” aspect in Dark Souls III. [spoiler] The time seems to be simultaneously blended with the Abyss and dark of long ago (in which the concept of time doesn't exists) and also the present that is experiencing the undying cycle of the fire legacy, which would probably be a base for proving the theory of the End of the World during the Filianore cutscene in The Ringed City (in which there is a burst of light, indicating time, and, consequently, a time-skip beyond the living of anything). [/spoiler]
As for the main objective, the player would have to kill the 4 lords of cinder that neglect themselves to link the flame once again because it would be useless and that they would die in which way. [spoiler] The only one that remains in the Firelink Shrine is Ludleth, whom has long ago linked the fire, and now is just waiting for his end on his throne... for that, he is known as The Exiled. [/spoiler] The objetive of killing those Lords would be to acquire the necessary power in order to link the fire.
Killing every Lord of Cinder and putting their ashes on their thrones will let the player travel to the Kiln of the First Flame, [spoiler] the place where the battle against Soul of Cinder happens, a manifestation of every Lord Soul until then. [/spoiler]
Not only in terms of new Lords of Cinder speculations and lore the game creates its identity, but there would also be the side-bosses encounters that reveal individuals or even groups that shaped the dying world of Dark Souls III (e.g. Pontiff Sulyvahn; Oceiros; etc). 
In terms of DLC (Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City), lore-wise speaking, it presents a rich story completion and also the Grand Finale for the series with the final boss fight against [spoiler] Slave Knight Gael, an undead, like you, seeking the blood of the Dark Soul for his lady's painting, who would be going to paint a new world for humanity. [/spoiler]

 [h1] Conclusion [/h1]

I cannot put in words my passion for the game, I can simply recommend buying it with or without a discount, it is worth each time played and each credit paid. I do not even possess a high knowledge about the game yet, but I am still discovering and reading about its deep and amazing world. 
Got some free time? Get Dark Souls' series to play and you will not regret it."
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Nothing you can write here will do it justice.  Its hard, play it. Just do it. Look up guides, play it through. Learn to love the process. You are going to die. Often just quit. Just play it through and thank me later. Your future gaming self will thank you. 10/10"
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,fun to play with other players
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"This is, thematically and in terms of gameplay, the finest game in the Dark Souls trilogy. I recommend getting it on PS4 on XBox One, or getting it on PC and immediately installing an anti-cheat mod. Unmodded, the game has serious vulnerabilities. We're not talking floaters in Fall Guys - we're talking unpatched exploits that can potentially damage your hardware. Thus, and considering Bandai Namco's and From Software's poor track record with reacting to vulnerability reports, the product as is is extremely not recommended."
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"For anyone who doesn't want to read about my struggles with mental health and trauma, just read the TL;DR below. I get heavy in the full story about my experience with this game.

TL;DR: Dark Souls III saved my life. I love it, and I think everyone should experience it, or any of the games from the Souls series.

;

I've had many amazing and terrible experiences with this game, but overall, it's helped me cope with some of the most difficult years of my life. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, general anxiety disorder, and ADHD. I don't think I would have survived the depression and trauma I've experienced lately if it weren't for this game. I failed out of a couple colleges due to mental breakdowns and attempted suicide on several occasions throughout the past 5 years. This game served as an escape from my everyday struggle. It's why I have 400 hours in this game on PC, and around 300 on PS4. I stopped playing this game a year ago, when I was finally in a good mental state of being.

Then the pandemic came.

I've gradually lost the ground of mental stability due to isolation, separation from the person I love the most and my depression being exacerbated. Due to circumstances, I cannot see my partner in person nearly ever. The last time I saw them was in March, and February before that. Although that isn't the most difficult thing I've dealt with this year. In January of 2021, my father had a massive aneurysm that he miraculously survived. Since then, though, he has been severely disabled and bedridden at a hospital. My family and I have been doing our best to keep him strong and on the road to recovery, but it's far from easy. At this point, he will be disabled for the rest of his life. The past couple months have been extremely trying, culminating with me calling the suicide hotline for the first time in years. I never thought I'd get this low again, but life happens, y'know?

Since I called that hotline, I've gotten a bit better. A lot of it has to do with my friends, family, and partner supporting me, as well as the therapy I'm undergoing. I've noticed though that I've really improved once I re-downloaded this game and started playing it again. There's just... something about the immense challenge these soulsborne games present that is so special. Overcoming these challenges are so cathartic and inspiring, and helps me feel capable tackling my real life problems. This game has tortured me at times whenever I struggled to find victory. But I always came back to this game after every defeat, unable to let myself give up. It taught me that can't let myself give up on life, no matter how many times I'm defeated.

I had set a challenge for myself a couple years back: to defeat the Nameless King solo. I had never done this before, and felt I needed to prove to myself I could do it. I am far from a great Souls player, so this was a big deal for me. I spent a year trying to beat Nameless King by myself (I was on NG+7 too, as my best character was on that save). I spec'd and re-spec'd into various builds, until I got my character to be a lightning caster/dark melee build. It was past a year at this point for my attempts. One day, I was going at NK as usual. I managed to get him to half health in his second phase, but I had exhausted all my estus. I kept hacking at him though, little by little getting him lower. He hit me a few times, getting me to being one-hit away from death. At this point, I was close to beating him. Just a few more hits... when he got to being one-hit, I threw out an attack as he began his own attack-- a gamble. And then... 

I did it. I won. I beat him. I watched the cutscene in total shock. Not a word... I was speechless. I lit the bonfire and then broke down into tears of joy and relief. It is still the biggest accomplishment in gaming for me. Overall, I haven't experienced many accomplishments in my life. The feeling of a hard-fought victory, even in a video game, had inspired me to not give up, and still inspires me to keep on going to this day. This game is one of the many reasons why I'm alive today.

I feel like my story isn't particularly uncommon. Many people have comfort games or shows or movies or books, and it's fine still if you don't have one of those. Dark Souls III might not be a comfort game for everyone, but I know the Souls games as a whole have been THAT game for a lot of people still. It could be THAT game for you.

If you've read this far into my story, thank you, I appreciate you so much. If you or someone close to you struggles with suicide, know that it's okay to feel that way. Life is hard and unforgiving at times. Painful, violent, and hopeless. And it will always be like that. But life can be also be immensely fulfilling. Full of love, joy, compassion, laughter, and peace. Hard times are often hard lessons so that we can grow stronger for ourselves and the people around us. The good times come to make life worth living, and the bad times come to make us worthy of life. If you're struggling, please, reach out to someone who cares about you, and if you can't find a person like that, the suicide hotline will be there for you (800-273-8255 if you're in the States). Suicide is a choice you make, but it isn't the only choice you can make. There's always a way out. You can conquer your demons. You are stronger than you know. Against seemingly immense odds, you can win. It's human to struggle. But it's also human to overcome. You got this. So all I have left to say is this:

""Good bye then. Be safe, friend. Don't you dare go Hollow."""
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Save got deleted, goodbye"
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"I waited to post this review until after I killed the last boss but was excited to post it way before. After having just beat the final boss about 30 mins ago I can say that this game isn't as hard as people say it is. The game challenges you for sure but it's not insanely hard to beat. I would recommend getting some friends to play this with too it enhances the fun in this game.

However, some hackers have recently become active who can put your character in a NG/NG+ (with all of your gear, inventory and SL) through the very fact of your summoning or invading into your world. Doing so makes your character vulnerable for anti-cheat ban cause now you look like a cheater. Word is that it was reported to the devs about exploits in the net code but they didn't respond. 
And now here I am, losing all 66h progress of my first run because of this.
Stay safe and use anti-cheaters modes, now I am aware that there are some good options out there."

DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,hardest thing so far was holding back the tears after realizing you bought the game one day before a 75% sale
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,Love this game but right now on PC it needs to be patched there is too much hacking going on. just lost my progress due to hackers
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,Cute game
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"One of the greatest games ever made, following the footsteps of the first dark souls with improved animations, netcoding and general mechanics. This game feels very smooth and fights are absolutely amazing. Dark souls 3 adds more challenge to the game by making the mobs more aggressive, a lot like in BloodBorn. I absolutely want to recommend this game as a big fan of dark souls series and for the gameplay quality but due to it's state I can not do so, I feel like I have the responsibility to inform you about the situation that's going on in the game. 

Cheaters have taken over the game in large numbers, Dark souls has it's own brutal anti-cheat system but it is very ineffective when cheaters can create alt steam accounts to bypass bans and strike again. The cheating scene has been going on for years and years now but it has evolved to the point where cheaters can actually cause permanent damage to your PC or even pish information you'd not want to share online. These cheats are evolving constantly due to the big playerbase and lack of action from Bandai Namco. So who knows maybe in future Dark souls 3 on steam could work as a backdoor access to your PC in a way. Very high security risk here. I talked to Bandai Namco's support about the issue and they are aware of what is going on and I was told that they are working on the issue, but in truth nothing has been done in 3 years or so when all this started to boom.

If you play this game in OFFLINE mode you will not have any problems, also there are mods such as Blue-Sentinel which is telling you when you are being invaded by a cheater and it tries to block you connecting to them in future, use of this mod is bannable reason but Bandai Namco's anti-cheat can't track it as the mod does not affect the game itself that much. I recommend using this mod if you plan to play the game."
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Extremely good game, however, an ongoing issue yet to be fixed or remotely addressed is the issue with hacking. In the last month, several issues with player's game being completely hacked into with malicious code that not only lets them into your game, but also your hard drive, SSD and potentially more. Check out the reddit for this game and its pinned post or some of the negative reviews below for more info. Great game, but probably one of the worst instances of hacking in terms of severity I've ever seen from a mainstream game that's being completely ignored."

I had been loving the game and I had just spent the last 37 hours playing.

This security issue needs to be addressed before this game can be recommended again, this is a huge issue that could even cause GPU hacks and totally corrupt your PC.

VALVE ADDRESS THIS NOW, THIS GAME SHOULD BE PULLED FROM YOUR STORE UNTIL THIS IS ADDRESSED!!!

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!"
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Good game, but is PLAGUED with hackers that teleport, force instant death animations, prevent you from using separation crystal (forcing you to force close the game) and in other cases completely wiping ALL of your progress That's right, a hacker can invade you and simply erase countless hours of progress from your character. They can also force actions on your character that makes the game detect you as a cheater, penalizing you and BANNING you from online forever even though you didn't do anything. While this hasn't happened to me there are plenty of cases of it happening. I cannot recommend the game until this is handled properly by FromSoftware.

There is a serious exploit making the rounds online that lets hackers mess up your save game really bad and Bamco and FromSoftware have been made aware of it a long time ago and they have chosen not to patch it.

In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words: ""The fire fades and the lords go without thrones."" When the link of fire is threatened, the bell tolls, unearthing the old Lords of Cinder from their graves...Aldrich, Saint of the Deep... Farron's Undead Legion, the Abyss Watchers... And the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital, Yhorm the Giant... Only, in truth... the Lords will abandon their thrones... And the Unkindled will rise. Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers.” [/i]

I am a big Souls-Like fan thanks to Dark Souls III, the first game of the genre, and the series, that I have played. 
I have been planning on writing a review about this game for a long time now, but never found the perfect timing to do so. Now, that the game is having a discount, and probably there will be plenty of people coming to give it a look, I decided to write this review. 
Like I did with my Dark Souls: Remastered review on Steam, I will separate this review into 2 main parts: the Technical Aspect and the Story/Plot/Lore of the game. 

 [h1] Technical Aspect: [/h1]

Firstly, I would like to say that this game has not the same mechanics as Dark Souls I and Dark Souls II, they end up being faster-paced, and also a lot of hitboxes issues have been improved. With that said, due to the date of launch of the game, it’s is obviously getting better graphics and textures, 2 aspects that the previous games weren’t strong at. 
Being FromSoftware the company that we are talking about, the scenario, the ambiance and the designs are, of course, on the point and perfectly fit in each occasion of the game, giving the player the same immersion given on the other Soulsborne games. Being even more detailed on that aspect, places like High Wall of Lothric, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, The Ringed City, Archdragon Peak, and Kiln of the First Flame, will mostly pass to the player a feeling of astonishment due to the amazing landscapes and atmosphere that they have. While, on the other hand, there will be areas that will give the player the feeling of progression and curiosity about what is to come, like, Road of Sacrifices, Cathedral of the Deep, Farron Keep, Catacombs of Carthus, and actually most of the other places to visit. 
Just like Dark Souls I, areas in Dark Souls III like Archdragon Peak and Untended Graves will be hidden and will only be discovered with certain triggers. 
The music can be really amazing at some bosses, but at others, it can feel kind of boring, which is a negative trait when compared to Dark Souls I’s unique compositions by Motoi Sakuraba (that being only my opinion though). 
The combat mechanic varied a lot from the previous games to Dark Souls III. Now there are specific habilities and possible combinations with each weapon presented. It synthesized ideas presented before in the other previous games and ended up making a pleasurable result (and, as said before, faster-paced). 
Lastly, to conclude this topic, Dark Souls III is a game that will not feel somewhat tiring when compared to the other Dark Souls, it balances every aspect already mentioned and does an amazing job to entertain the player for the first run until how many times one will feel like to play it again and again and again (in my case, 4 runs have already been completed). 

 [h1] Story/Plot/Lore: [/h1]

It would be impossible to put together every piece of lore in a review, thus I will be summarizing the main plot.
Unkindled, the player is a composition of the ash from the once, fire-devoted, undead that has given itself to the flame, and its duty remains the same. 
The game starts off presenting that the “fire fades” and that the Lords go without thrones. Giving that we are in the same universe set by Dark Souls I and II, we are left with speculations until finally arrive at conclusions by progressing in the game. 
The whereabouts are the “same” as Dark Souls I… However, there are slightly different things that might give the idea of the passage of time. Hundreds, or perhaps, thousands of years have passed since the Age of Fire and mighty new Lords of Cinder have linked the fire to maintain it. Even though there are controversies on the “time” aspect in Dark Souls III. [spoiler] The time seems to be simultaneously blended with the Abyss and dark of long ago (in which the concept of time doesn't exists) and also the present that is experiencing the undying cycle of the fire legacy, which would probably be a base for proving the theory of the End of the World during the Filianore cutscene in The Ringed City (in which there is a burst of light, indicating time, and, consequently, a time-skip beyond the living of anything). [/spoiler]
As for the main objective, the player would have to kill the 4 lords of cinder that neglect themselves to link the flame once again because it would be useless and that they would die in which way. [spoiler] The only one that remains in the Firelink Shrine is Ludleth, whom has long ago linked the fire, and now is just waiting for his end on his throne... for that, he is known as The Exiled. [/spoiler] The objetive of killing those Lords would be to acquire the necessary power in order to link the fire.
Killing every Lord of Cinder and putting their ashes on their thrones will let the player travel to the Kiln of the First Flame, [spoiler] the place where the battle against Soul of Cinder happens, a manifestation of every Lord Soul until then. [/spoiler]
Not only in terms of new Lords of Cinder speculations and lore the game creates its identity, but there would also be the side-bosses encounters that reveal individuals or even groups that shaped the dying world of Dark Souls III (e.g. Pontiff Sulyvahn; Oceiros; etc). 
In terms of DLC (Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City), lore-wise speaking, it presents a rich story completion and also the Grand Finale for the series with the final boss fight against [spoiler] Slave Knight Gael, an undead, like you, seeking the blood of the Dark Soul for his lady's painting, who would be going to paint a new world for humanity. [/spoiler]

 [h1] Conclusion [/h1]

I cannot put in words my passion for the game, I can simply recommend buying it with or without a discount, it is worth each time played and each credit paid. I do not even possess a high knowledge about the game yet, but I am still discovering and reading about its deep and amazing world. 
Got some free time? Get Dark Souls' series to play and you will not regret it."
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Nothing you can write here will do it justice.  Its hard, play it. Just do it. Look up guides, play it through. Learn to love the process. You are going to die. Often just quit. Just play it through and thank me later. Your future gaming self will thank you. 10/10"
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,fun to play with other players
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"This is, thematically and in terms of gameplay, the finest game in the Dark Souls trilogy. I recommend getting it on PS4 on XBox One, or getting it on PC and immediately installing an anti-cheat mod. Unmodded, the game has serious vulnerabilities. We're not talking floaters in Fall Guys - we're talking unpatched exploits that can potentially damage your hardware. Thus, and considering Bandai Namco's and From Software's poor track record with reacting to vulnerability reports, the product as is is extremely not recommended."
DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"For anyone who doesn't want to read about my struggles with mental health and trauma, just read the TL;DR below. I get heavy in the full story about my experience with this game.

TL;DR: Dark Souls III saved my life. I love it, and I think everyone should experience it, or any of the games from the Souls series.

;

I've had many amazing and terrible experiences with this game, but overall, it's helped me cope with some of the most difficult years of my life. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, general anxiety disorder, and ADHD. I don't think I would have survived the depression and trauma I've experienced lately if it weren't for this game. I failed out of a couple colleges due to mental breakdowns and attempted suicide on several occasions throughout the past 5 years. This game served as an escape from my everyday struggle. It's why I have 400 hours in this game on PC, and around 300 on PS4. I stopped playing this game a year ago, when I was finally in a good mental state of being.

Then the pandemic came.

I've gradually lost the ground of mental stability due to isolation, separation from the person I love the most and my depression being exacerbated. Due to circumstances, I cannot see my partner in person nearly ever. The last time I saw them was in March, and February before that. Although that isn't the most difficult thing I've dealt with this year. In January of 2021, my father had a massive aneurysm that he miraculously survived. Since then, though, he has been severely disabled and bedridden at a hospital. My family and I have been doing our best to keep him strong and on the road to recovery, but it's far from easy. At this point, he will be disabled for the rest of his life. The past couple months have been extremely trying, culminating with me calling the suicide hotline for the first time in years. I never thought I'd get this low again, but life happens, y'know?

Since I called that hotline, I've gotten a bit better. A lot of it has to do with my friends, family, and partner supporting me, as well as the therapy I'm undergoing. I've noticed though that I've really improved once I re-downloaded this game and started playing it again. There's just... something about the immense challenge these soulsborne games present that is so special. Overcoming these challenges are so cathartic and inspiring, and helps me feel capable tackling my real life problems. This game has tortured me at times whenever I struggled to find victory. But I always came back to this game after every defeat, unable to let myself give up. It taught me that can't let myself give up on life, no matter how many times I'm defeated.

I had set a challenge for myself a couple years back: to defeat the Nameless King solo. I had never done this before, and felt I needed to prove to myself I could do it. I am far from a great Souls player, so this was a big deal for me. I spent a year trying to beat Nameless King by myself (I was on NG+7 too, as my best character was on that save). I spec'd and re-spec'd into various builds, until I got my character to be a lightning caster/dark melee build. It was past a year at this point for my attempts. One day, I was going at NK as usual. I managed to get him to half health in his second phase, but I had exhausted all my estus. I kept hacking at him though, little by little getting him lower. He hit me a few times, getting me to being one-hit away from death. At this point, I was close to beating him. Just a few more hits... when he got to being one-hit, I threw out an attack as he began his own attack-- a gamble. And then... 

I did it. I won. I beat him. I watched the cutscene in total shock. Not a word... I was speechless. I lit the bonfire and then broke down into tears of joy and relief. It is still the biggest accomplishment in gaming for me. Overall, I haven't experienced many accomplishments in my life. The feeling of a hard-fought victory, even in a video game, had inspired me to not give up, and still inspires me to keep on going to this day. This game is one of the many reasons why I'm alive today.

I feel like my story isn't particularly uncommon. Many people have comfort games or shows or movies or books, and it's fine still if you don't have one of those. Dark Souls III might not be a comfort game for everyone, but I know the Souls games as a whole have been THAT game for a lot of people still. It could be THAT game for you.

If you've read this far into my story, thank you, I appreciate you so much. If you or someone close to you struggles with suicide, know that it's okay to feel that way. Life is hard and unforgiving at times. Painful, violent, and hopeless. And it will always be like that. But life can be also be immensely fulfilling. Full of love, joy, compassion, laughter, and peace. Hard times are often hard lessons so that we can grow stronger for ourselves and the people around us. The good times come to make life worth living, and the bad times come to make us worthy of life. If you're struggling, please, reach out to someone who cares about you, and if you can't find a person like that, the suicide hotline will be there for you (800-273-8255 if you're in the States). Suicide is a choice you make, but it isn't the only choice you can make. There's always a way out. You can conquer your demons. You are stronger than you know. Against seemingly immense odds, you can win. It's human to struggle. But it's also human to overcome. You got this. So all I have left to say is this:

""Good bye then. Be safe, friend. Don't you dare go Hollow."""

DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"I waited to post this review until after I killed the last boss but was excited to post it way before.

I would recommend getting some friends to play this with too it enhances the fun in this game.

Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"One of the best RPG's I've ever played. It most definitely has its flaws but the challenge you can get from this game is absolutely mint. 
Some things to note before buying this game 

1) It's armor system is unlike most other games. It blocks status effects and crowd control until it is removed then they can be applied (a couple of feats you can pick up can bypass this on enemies but that's the exception not the norm)

2) If you're playing through this game for the first time, don't feel bad if you can't play it at the highest difficulty. It's not meant for a first time playthrough but to challenge experienced players on subsequent ones with more enemies, more intelligent enemy AI and (of course) stronger enemies as well.

3) When building your party composition, it's better to do all 4 magical, all four physical, or two and two. I do not recommend you go with one person solely as one thing and the other three as another as that one person all by themselves will not be contributing much to fights.

4) There is no ""tank"" in this game. That sort of role doesn't exist. There are also no traditional classes, optimizing for certain builds is of course a thing (and for harder difficulties almost mandatory) but the sky is the limit with your imagination so long as you play within the confines of the system

Hope you enjoy the game, feel free to hit me up if you're new and would like someone to play with. Game plays just fine solo as well but games are always more fun with others. =)"
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"I started this game during COVID in August 2020, when a couple friends suggested that it’s like a tabletop RPG (“TTRPG”) and might be fun to play together weekly. I couldn’t get into it at first, mostly due to distraction, but once we got a good third of the way through the first act, I was intrigued. I then became more hooked each session and by the fifth or so, I was loving the game and actively looking forward to our game nights. Once we were halfway, I started a solo save to catch up to where we were, more thoroughly following the story on my own. It took us about 6 months to finish the game, but we never missed a week of playing in all that time and I completed my solo game soon after. While it was partially the social aspect of hanging out with friends online, it’s not an exaggeration to say that this game helped me stay sane during one of the craziest times of my life thus far and it will always hold a special place for me because of it. But that was also in large part because this game is simply awesome. It’s probably the only game that I ended up loving despite not enjoying the first solid 8 hours or so of gameplay.

OS2 is essentially a TTRPG adapted to a fully realized digital world. While it has mechanics you might expect for a game going for that feel such as dialogue options, it does several other unique things to achieve that feel. For instance, one of the appeals of a TTRPG is that you can do whatever you want within the logic of the game, not just narratively, but with how you maneuver in combat. Considering the limitations of a finite game, OS2 allows for a multitude of combat options that never feels limited, even though obviously it is to some extent. The environment is highly interactable and can be used to your advantage with dynamic and creative environmental conditions. Skills like teleport and various battlefield-warping abilities also do much more clever things beyond just dealing damage. There’s also the system of physical and magic armor that prevents conditions, adding a layer of complexity that encourages strategic play, even though it’s deceptively simple on the surface. I still felt like I had the variety of options available in a TTRPG, even if it was limited to a finite combination of options. It says a lot when being stuck on a given fight could be solved by a better approach rather than simply trying to level up.

Other TTRPG elements deal with the world-building, story, and tone. There’s a rich world with lots of peoples with their own rich histories and varied proclivities, interacting with internal and external factions and nations with their own agendas. I like that the different peoples and factions aren’t the usual monoliths common to fantasy and demonstrate internal diversity. There’s plenty of lore to be explored in Rivellon that makes the stories and locations you encounter come to life.

The tone achieved by the narrative is also on point. One commonality to a lot of TTRPGs is a serious story that inevitably has some silliness as the players get up to some mischief or another. This leads to dramatic and intriguing storylines that are willing to step back for a moment of humor that (ideally) doesn’t break you out of the story. This is exactly how I’d describe OS2. The story is fairly serious and involves some dark themes at times, but at numerous points, especially side quests, there are amusing NPCs and conversations galore that never quite break the narrative but add a good deal of clever humor and even some laugh-out-loud moments without straying into the just plain goofy territory that pulls you from the narrative.

This isn’t the prettiest game I’ve played for its time, but still looks great and I think it’s balanced very well with the playstyle, offering vivid, immersive, appealing scenery that isn’t too confusing to navigate. The audio design is amazing. Sound effects are fine, but the soundtrack is superb. I generally dislike the sort of generic DnD folksy tavern style music that this soundtrack mostly fits into. But for whatever reason, these songs just click with me and never blend together like much of that kind of music usually does to me. If I hear a song from this game, I’ll recognize it immediately. Some tracks are better than others, but overall, they all work quite well. The vast majority of the massive script is also competently voiced, which is incredible.

I found the story pretty strong. There is a main quest full of twists and turns, personal to your character that you must progress to move on with the game. There are a number of side quests as well, a staple of RPGs that can be really hit or miss. While not quite as good as some of the best side quests like Witcher 3, I think the side quests are generally very good. OS2 dodges dull fetch quests and “please kill the rats in my cellar” quests. Even the simplest quests often are made more interesting in some way, such as an early quest in which you have to fight a trio of saltwater crocodiles who have swallowed a pair of teleportation gloves that will be super useful once you get them. The quests are almost always engaging in some way given the strong writing of NPCs and the worldbuilding features that makes these quests entertaining in their own right even aside from the consequent exploration and challenge. None of the quests did I feel like was just some random bullshit I was doing solely to get experience.

There are 6 pre-made characters to choose from. I’ll call these “canon PCs.” Each canon PC has a continuing personal quest such as Lohse’s quest to rid herself of demonic possession or Sebille’s quest for revenge. These quests are a great way to flesh out the main characters, even if they’re not super long and only come up intermittently. Through several playthroughs, I played through the story quests of every canon PC. While my favorites are Lohse, Fane, and Sebille, none of the personal stories fell flat and I can’t imagine playing through the game with one of them in your party without doing their personal quests. Beware, if you make a custom character, you don’t get a personal story.

The gameplay is great. This is almost definitely my favorite combat system for a pure turn-based RPG. The combat is in a lot of ways closer to “turn-based strategy” than purely “RPG,” but this fits the TTRPG style with line of sight, distance, range, positioning, area of effect, enemy weaknesses, and build diversity all being important to your success in a given battle. There’s a wealth of options for each of your four party members to invest in and combine. Even after three playthroughs, there are still styles and skill combinations I’m interested in trying out some time.

This game can be played in a group or solo. In a solo game, you get one main character and fill your party with up to three of the other canon PCs. As a group, each of you has plays their own main character, filling any other slots with side characters. It was really fun experiencing, commentating, and poking fun at the story’s events as a group of three. I enjoyed my group game a bit more on balance, but that will depend on your group. If you have a hard time following the story when communicating with your group, it may not be as enjoyable but we mostly were able to follow it despite talking the whole time on voice chat. The gameplay is solid, but you’re really missing out if you can’t pay attention to the narrative this game has to offer so I’d prioritize that. I found solo play easier as it gives you more control over party synergy and coordination and I was better able to engage with the story and learn the basics of gameplay and strategy. The other major difference is in a group, you have to make sure to listen in on conversations with NPCs or you simply miss story, so you have to coordinate.

Ultimately, this game rocks. On the whole, I loved it and would have to look for things to complain about, the majority of them very minor."
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"Its alright, as long you dont think about it too much."
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"God this game is good. 
Immersive Story, plenty of details to explore, fun turn based combat. First Playthrough took me around 80 hours. You can sit back and dive into it just like into a good book. You might want to use a searchengine for some hints at times :). For me personally one of the best games i have ever played and except for one or two riddles i loved every single minute of it! 9/10"
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"Just finished this game. With my short attention span, it’s really rare to spend 91h on anything, so they must have done something right. I enjoyed most of my time playing the game and I recommend it but it surely has some flaws.

The dialogue was funny and well written. The characters had interesting stories and a lot of personality, which made you invested in solving their problems and storylines. The voice acting was also great. The visuals are pretty good. The towns, dungeons and castles are well designed and textured. I’m not really a fun of turn-based systems - fighting in RPGs to me has always been a necessary evil - but this system was not bad! It’s intuitive enough to understand what you’re doing but leaves a bit of for experimentation. The maps are very big and exploring them feels very rewarding - there’s not much of dull time spent walking around. There’s always an intriguing chest or a quirky npc that’s needs you to do something for them. The freedom in this game is something I haven’t really experienced in any other RPG - you can solve quests in many ways and you can do almost anything you can think of - steal, kill, trick, flirt, etc. I really started to have fun when I decided embrace my thief character and started to sneak into everywhere I shouldn’t be. Most times this was rewarded with loot, information and, some times, even new quests so it didn’t felt inconsequential. Other games would just give me a tag for dialogue. Of course this amount of freedom led to some bugs here and there, but nothing too game breaking.

Here are a few things that could be better (spoiller alert):
- The quest system is a bit confusing, there’s too much information and no way to filter it out.
- There’s too much googling needed. I tried to avoid cheating as much as I could but I spent a lot of time looking at my phone.
- The inventory is hard to manage and could have more filter options and marquee selection.
- Surfaces are an interesting mechanic but some of them clutter the screen. Water and ice are ok, but fire and poison, for example, are way too much - sometimes you can't even see your character.
- The ending felt underwhelming and rushed. The character stories where way more rewarding to finish than the main quest.
- The “cutscenes” could be more epic. They’re just concept art with a tiny bit of animation. Lack of budget, maybe? And why is Windego narrating?
- This is more of an opinion, but too much moral ambiguity in characters can make them all feel similar. They turn into a grey canvas with some specific motivations tossed on top. Sometimes that’s not enough to make you care.
- No more sob stories with animals, please. I almost quit playing after the finding Emmie thing. And then you throw bear cubs, pigs, little chickens… at me? No-one wants this, trust me!

Generally this is a very good game with a lot of potential, but has a few small flaws that, all together, prevent it from being an AMAZING game. 75/100"

Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,Really good game. Played a shit ton more on console . Bland ass review.
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"People will hate me for this, especially friends, but I just can't get into this game that much, I am trying so hard to like it. For not knowing anything about it, yes it is very difficult. But I don't go into RPGs thinking they will be harder beyond combat choices and knowing where to go--but apparently their combat system (as fun as it is) has a ""depth"" but almost all the enemies just do the typical poison, fire, dodge combos that frustrate you. Early on it is difficult to negate these elements. 

As per the story, I can't get attached to the characters and the main story is muddled already with various elements that don't make sense. 9 hours in and I am still on the Mage island of sorts. Exploration is encouraged but deviated by DEADLY traps and enemies. I either need to be on a walkthrough looking up the order, or trying to experiment over and over for the best options that don't seem to make logical sense. Which is fine, but it is hard so it becomes a chore. 

Out of all the characters, I like Fane. I don't know why. He reminds me of playing Disco Elysium with satire and wit, but that's about it. I don't understand a lot of the systems right away and it becomes a chore. I thought the source muted collars would give an opportunity to learn more about the lore and characters, but they (the characters) all seem to be shoved down your throat with their hardcore demeanor. 

Maybe it's better with a friend? I don't know. I will keep playing, but I am struggling to take this one in. Games shouldn't be fun with an effort. It isn't ""too"" hard, but it feels like it's pushing back too hard in the beginning to make ya wanna play. The intro (ship) was really cool, though. But the mechanics you get excited about are not combat rewarded, but just constant in battle. You never not see them and it becomes annoying. 

The maps are disorienting too. I have pretty good cognitive mapping skills, but in this one, i struggle to remember where things are. I enjoy that all the characters and NPCs have voices though.

Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"[i]This game is really nothing short of amazing.[/i]

Every scene/fight/encounter/quest/anything can be experienced differently in a separate playthrough, by choosing a different dialogue option or by attacking without even attempting to talk or maybe you found a mechanism you had no clue was there before and it immediately gets you past that one fight that took so long the playthrough before. 

This game is exactly what it means to be a ""[b]role-playing game[/b];"" one where you can make your characters into whatever you want, and one where your choices in a single encounter can really have an effect on nearly everything in the game that follows. My friend and I wiped out every single citizen of each town just because we felt like it and could. The downside was that it prevents us from experiencing some of the content that came from them, but it also gave us alternate ways to finish quests that would not have been previously known. 

The game is updated here and there, despite its 2017 release, with ""gift bags"" that add so much original content that I find it ridiculous. 

One more thing... [b]MODS[/b]. The mods that the community make for this game are unreal and add so much to an already incredible game. I personally recommend picking up the Crafting Overhaul mod and at least a few class mods.

All in all, this game is unlike anything I've played before and has unlimited replay value. It's just as fun solo as it is playing with a friend (or three). [b]HIGHLY[/b] recommend to anyone who loves rpg, action, adventure... I mean it's got it all. A very serious [b]10/10[/b]."

Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"One of the best RPG's I've ever played. It most definitely has its flaws but the challenge you can get from this game is absolutely mint. 
Some things to note before buying this game 

1) It's armor system is unlike most other games. It blocks status effects and crowd control until it is removed then they can be applied (a couple of feats you can pick up can bypass this on enemies but that's the exception not the norm)

2) If you're playing through this game for the first time, don't feel bad if you can't play it at the highest difficulty. It's not meant for a first time playthrough but to challenge experienced players on subsequent ones with more enemies, more intelligent enemy AI and (of course) stronger enemies as well.

3) When building your party composition, it's better to do all 4 magical, all four physical, or two and two. I do not recommend you go with one person solely as one thing and the other three as another as that one person all by themselves will not be contributing much to fights.

4) There is no ""tank"" in this game. That sort of role doesn't exist. There are also no traditional classes, optimizing for certain builds is of course a thing (and for harder difficulties almost mandatory) but the sky is the limit with your imagination so long as you play within the confines of the system

Hope you enjoy the game, feel free to hit me up if you're new and would like someone to play with. Game plays just fine solo as well but games are always more fun with others. =)"
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"I started this game during COVID in August 2020, when a couple friends suggested that it’s like a tabletop RPG (“TTRPG”) and might be fun to play together weekly. I couldn’t get into it at first, mostly due to distraction, but once we got a good third of the way through the first act, I was intrigued. I then became more hooked each session and by the fifth or so, I was loving the game and actively looking forward to our game nights. Once we were halfway, I started a solo save to catch up to where we were, more thoroughly following the story on my own. It took us about 6 months to finish the game, but we never missed a week of playing in all that time and I completed my solo game soon after. While it was partially the social aspect of hanging out with friends online, it’s not an exaggeration to say that this game helped me stay sane during one of the craziest times of my life thus far and it will always hold a special place for me because of it. But that was also in large part because this game is simply awesome. It’s probably the only game that I ended up loving despite not enjoying the first solid 8 hours or so of gameplay.

OS2 is essentially a TTRPG adapted to a fully realized digital world. While it has mechanics you might expect for a game going for that feel such as dialogue options, it does several other unique things to achieve that feel. For instance, one of the appeals of a TTRPG is that you can do whatever you want within the logic of the game, not just narratively, but with how you maneuver in combat. Considering the limitations of a finite game, OS2 allows for a multitude of combat options that never feels limited, even though obviously it is to some extent. The environment is highly interactable and can be used to your advantage with dynamic and creative environmental conditions. Skills like teleport and various battlefield-warping abilities also do much more clever things beyond just dealing damage. There’s also the system of physical and magic armor that prevents conditions, adding a layer of complexity that encourages strategic play, even though it’s deceptively simple on the surface. I still felt like I had the variety of options available in a TTRPG, even if it was limited to a finite combination of options. It says a lot when being stuck on a given fight could be solved by a better approach rather than simply trying to level up.

Other TTRPG elements deal with the world-building, story, and tone. There’s a rich world with lots of peoples with their own rich histories and varied proclivities, interacting with internal and external factions and nations with their own agendas. I like that the different peoples and factions aren’t the usual monoliths common to fantasy and demonstrate internal diversity. There’s plenty of lore to be explored in Rivellon that makes the stories and locations you encounter come to life.

The tone achieved by the narrative is also on point. One commonality to a lot of TTRPGs is a serious story that inevitably has some silliness as the players get up to some mischief or another. This leads to dramatic and intriguing storylines that are willing to step back for a moment of humor that (ideally) doesn’t break you out of the story. This is exactly how I’d describe OS2. The story is fairly serious and involves some dark themes at times, but at numerous points, especially side quests, there are amusing NPCs and conversations galore that never quite break the narrative but add a good deal of clever humor and even some laugh-out-loud moments without straying into the just plain goofy territory that pulls you from the narrative.

This isn’t the prettiest game I’ve played for its time, but still looks great and I think it’s balanced very well with the playstyle, offering vivid, immersive, appealing scenery that isn’t too confusing to navigate. The audio design is amazing. Sound effects are fine, but the soundtrack is superb. I generally dislike the sort of generic DnD folksy tavern style music that this soundtrack mostly fits into. But for whatever reason, these songs just click with me and never blend together like much of that kind of music usually does to me. If I hear a song from this game, I’ll recognize it immediately. Some tracks are better than others, but overall, they all work quite well. The vast majority of the massive script is also competently voiced, which is incredible.

I found the story pretty strong. There is a main quest full of twists and turns, personal to your character that you must progress to move on with the game. There are a number of side quests as well, a staple of RPGs that can be really hit or miss. While not quite as good as some of the best side quests like Witcher 3, I think the side quests are generally very good. OS2 dodges dull fetch quests and “please kill the rats in my cellar” quests. Even the simplest quests often are made more interesting in some way, such as an early quest in which you have to fight a trio of saltwater crocodiles who have swallowed a pair of teleportation gloves that will be super useful once you get them. The quests are almost always engaging in some way given the strong writing of NPCs and the worldbuilding features that makes these quests entertaining in their own right even aside from the consequent exploration and challenge. None of the quests did I feel like was just some random bullshit I was doing solely to get experience.

There are 6 pre-made characters to choose from. I’ll call these “canon PCs.” Each canon PC has a continuing personal quest such as Lohse’s quest to rid herself of demonic possession or Sebille’s quest for revenge. These quests are a great way to flesh out the main characters, even if they’re not super long and only come up intermittently. Through several playthroughs, I played through the story quests of every canon PC. While my favorites are Lohse, Fane, and Sebille, none of the personal stories fell flat and I can’t imagine playing through the game with one of them in your party without doing their personal quests. Beware, if you make a custom character, you don’t get a personal story.

The gameplay is great. This is almost definitely my favorite combat system for a pure turn-based RPG. The combat is in a lot of ways closer to “turn-based strategy” than purely “RPG,” but this fits the TTRPG style with line of sight, distance, range, positioning, area of effect, enemy weaknesses, and build diversity all being important to your success in a given battle. There’s a wealth of options for each of your four party members to invest in and combine. Even after three playthroughs, there are still styles and skill combinations I’m interested in trying out some time.

This game can be played in a group or solo. In a solo game, you get one main character and fill your party with up to three of the other canon PCs. As a group, each of you has plays their own main character, filling any other slots with side characters. It was really fun experiencing, commentating, and poking fun at the story’s events as a group of three. I enjoyed my group game a bit more on balance, but that will depend on your group. If you have a hard time following the story when communicating with your group, it may not be as enjoyable but we mostly were able to follow it despite talking the whole time on voice chat. The gameplay is solid, but you’re really missing out if you can’t pay attention to the narrative this game has to offer so I’d prioritize that. I found solo play easier as it gives you more control over party synergy and coordination and I was better able to engage with the story and learn the basics of gameplay and strategy. The other major difference is in a group, you have to make sure to listen in on conversations with NPCs or you simply miss story, so you have to coordinate.

Ultimately, this game rocks. On the whole, I loved it and would have to look for things to complain about, the majority of them very minor."

"
The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22330,"I want to preface this with an admission - I played Skyrim before I played Oblivion. When I first picked it up, I was looking to see where Bethesda had come from and was looking for another similar experience. I loaded it up and was faced with characters made of plasticine, weird dialogue and a floaty combat system that actually killed me if I just ran ahead blindly. I did not like it.

A couple of years on, I came back. I think the biggest shock for me was how different it was and I expected to understand it based on Skyrim. Oblivion is not Skyrim. It's so much more. Oblivion is colourful, funny in all the right ways and the writing... the writing for the quests is phenomenal. There are many characters that you'll find yourself remembering so much further down the line, quests that just stand out as iconic and generally a much more fantastical feeling than I ever got with Skyrim. I've loved both, but give me a choice between the two and I'll gladly step into Cyrodiil for another go. 

The combat handles like you're swinging a pool noodle, but magic is where the combat in this game shines. The level of customisation and the utility of spells is phenomenal, and when you consider how easy it can be to mod this game you can fix any niggling issues you come across. 

I don't know what it is about the NPC dialogue, but even though it's comically bad it's so warming to the heart. The characters care about the world, and even if one will sit there bringing up some major threat only to be met with a complaint about mudcrabs, they all feel connected to the place they live in.

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22330,"I want to preface this with an admission - I played Skyrim before I played Oblivion. When I first picked it up, I was looking to see where Bethesda had come from and was looking for another similar experience. I loaded it up and was faced with characters made of plasticine, weird dialogue and a floaty combat system that actually killed me if I just ran ahead blindly. I did not like it.

A couple of years on, I came back. I think the biggest shock for me was how different it was and I expected to understand it based on Skyrim. Oblivion is not Skyrim. It's so much more. Oblivion is colourful, funny in all the right ways and the writing... the writing for the quests is phenomenal. There are many characters that you'll find yourself remembering so much further down the line, quests that just stand out as iconic and generally a much more fantastical feeling than I ever got with Skyrim. I've loved both, but give me a choice between the two and I'll gladly step into Cyrodiil for another go. 

The combat handles like you're swinging a pool noodle, but magic is where the combat in this game shines. The level of customisation and the utility of spells is phenomenal, and when you consider how easy it can be to mod this game you can fix any niggling issues you come across. 

I don't know what it is about the NPC dialogue, but even though it's comically bad it's so warming to the heart. The characters care about the world, and even if one will sit there bringing up some major threat only to be met with a complaint about mudcrabs, they all feel connected to the place they live in. I love it.

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Love the game, BUT...

Has serious lag issues with menus, which never used to be there. So every menu it stutters for 5/10 seconds (on an SSD) pretty sure its having a major problem with loading the thumbnails for items and units. So every time you wanna trade, lag, every time you take prisoners, lag, every time you wanna upgrade your troops, lag.

May seem small but having this constantly with every menu you open gets seriously annoying. Id say get it because its great, and the mods will be unbelievable, but wait until they fix this damn stuttering.

Also dear Devs, literally no one cares about MP, thats not what your fanbase is, so stop updating that rubbish and focus purely on the core game, cheers."

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"As someone who followed this project very closely on the official forums I have to say that TaleWorlds is an absolute garbage at their job. They are sidelining the community at every opportunity. They have a track record of hindering any and all attempts of their modding community at fixing their broken game and have shown actual jealousy over the work of their modding scene.
Almost two years ago TW proclaimed that custom, moddable servers can't be made now, but they'll be a thing in 2022, which prompted the modding community to making their own custom servers in few days of work, all by adding few lines of code. TW of course threw a hissy fit over it and patched it out, but it at least shown us how incompetent they are at their own jobs.
""It's early access, you have to lower your expectations"" - My expectations are so low that I had to dig a hole for them to lay in.
This game should have never been released in Early Access. You need tons of mods to make it actually feel alive and fun, something which TW is actively hindering by throwing tantrums at all Total Conversion modders, because once again - players can do a better job than the actual devs.
This whole development process is a farce from start to finish. I honestly hope that when they (maybe) eventually release their 1.6, they'll adress all these issues and stop sidelining players with corpo-talk and tantrums. But it's TaleWorlds, so the reality is that they're probably limiting our possibilities to milk us on future in-game-transactions and mediocre DLCs.
I wish we got the same treatment Warband did with Viking Conquest, which was a joined project of both the developers and the community.

Forums topics I'm referring to in the review are 'An open letter from the Kingdoms of Arda team, and the total-conversion mod community' and 'Multiplayer mods can't be made until 2022 unless we find an alternative', but there are literal hundreds other posts and topics there that show how out of touch and jaded the devs are.

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"As a young boy my character was enamored by the breadth and depth of the world. Distant lands inhabited by dangerous armies, weapons warped into form by foreign designs. It was all exciting!
Then my character became a man; a sword-wielding nemesis to all opposing. And in his adulthood he elected to realize his worldly infatuation. So he traveled to far places where the weather was cold and armor expensive, to places where men rode horses and shot from a bow. Finally he arrived to a place covered in sand and swarmed by furtive caravans. Here in the sweltering heat a primordial realization, shrouded at first by an unsteady open-mindedness, approached through the desert’s feverish waves. And here my character turned around and left; trading the dusty wastes for verdant forests.

	He retired, after only a few weeks of conquest, to Sargot. In the city he disbanded his forces, wishing them good fortune and used his lingering wealth to purchase a small studio apartment. He then bought a subscription to [i] Old School Runescape [/i] and played out the rest of his days in a game which is slightly less of a fucking grind."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The game has been in EA for more than a year, and I bought into it first day on release. A year on I remain disappointed. Singleplayer, the soul of Warband, is all but abandoned, the multiplayer, frankly, I don't give a fuss about. Constant bug fixes that show no sign of improving, no singleplayer features for increased immersion, only fewer and fewer roleplaying options. I would have left a fuming review a year ago for the unnecessary addition of the poorly-thought-out heir system, and now I have no more hope for a remedy in this game. ""Too complex"" they say -- well I work in IT and an idea is not rejected on if it will be ""too complex"", but if it is needed. If it's ""too complex"", find a way to implement it with less complexity."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I really like this game but can't recommend it until the AI during battles, especially during sieges, is just even a little better.  
My biggest gripe, one that almost makes me want to just quit completely: During a siege, when attacking, your troops have a couple towers with three ladders each. Your troops will only use one ladder, and even then only go up a hand full at a time which means they get immediately killed by the couple enemy troops waiting at the top. The rest of your troops are just kinda jumbled at the bottom of the tower all trying to climb the one ladder.... even though there are two more right next to it. I've even tried to use my character to push them on to it but that doesn't work either. I know its early access, but it has been a year."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,This is probably the best of the best for its genre. Plenty of room for improvement with many elements of the game but very enjoyable.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Singleplayer is okay, but updates have been minimal for the amount of time Taleworlds has had.  Even worse is the multiplayer side, the only official online modes are Skirmish and Captain, both of which became uninteresting very quickly.

Taleworlds has had so much time to work on this, yet the server stability has effectively remained the same since launch.  I love the fighting mechanics, I have since Warband, I played on a Napoleonic Wars battalion for a long time, but this has easily been the most disappointing addition to the franchise yet."

""Ja"" because the game improved several aspects. The UI looks much better. They introduced a much needed siege system, in which you actually need to build siege engines to storm a castle - and it is magnificent! There are more commands to control your troops, and they added a smithing system which was severely lacking in the Warband version. They also introduced caravans which is a cool addition.

""Nein"" because teh game is still VERY raw. It is terribly optimized. On lowest settings at FHD (GTX2060) the battles stutter a lot. You have to pass a Will Roll of Diff 25 to endure playing large sieges as a PowerPoint presentation. The smithing system is simply broken. The best two handed swords you craft, using rare materials, will be ~20k worth. A JAVELIN can go as high as 180k. That breaks the economy too - once you can craft javelins you achieved infinite money.

The leveling system seems broken beyond repair and I hope the devs redo it from scratch. There are 6 attributes, each with 3 skills attached. The only purpose of the attributes is to determine how far/fast you can level its skills. You can only level skills by USING them, but as they get closer to the cap, you get a multiplier penalty, e.g. you get only 1/2, then 1/4, until you get no exp at all. To mitigate that, the devs added a ""focus points"" which increases the cap/multiplier for a single skill only (max 5 focus per skill). You get 1 focus point per level, 1 attribute point per 4 levels. The progression is non-linear i.e. the higher the level of the character/skill, the more exp points it needs to progress - but you get LESS exp points due to the multiplier penalty. To eventually get max attributes, you'd need to reach lvl 200-ish.

It is much more intuitive than it sounds. The key problem is that, to level up, you need to progress skills. But to progress skills you need to level up. The non-linear behaviour is TERRIBLY balanced. Even after cheating to get all attributes to 10 (max speed/cap to all skills), after ~40h my character is barely lvl 35 (remember, non-linear; so it gets much worse later). If you try to focus in one attribute/group of skills, you'll level up even slower. Yes, in Bannerlord, specializing is bad!

Once you create a kingdom, your lords force you to declare war on every kingdom with less troops. Lords with traits such as ""Honour"" and ""Honesty"" pass their time pillaging villages. You can also send your companions to form parties to protect your own settlements, but instead they will join the murdering as well - but IN YOUR NAME! There is no ""toggle"". You can't say ""no, bad boy, sit."" You can control some policies of your kingdom, but there is no ""Chill Daddy"" policy and everybody is bloodthirsty the whole time.

I ran out of space but I could still rant about marriage, charming/persuasion, the way the NPCs creeply smile at you as if they'd had mushrooms, the lack of armor crafting, customized troops trees and of a potato at the end of this post.

Mount & Blade is one of my favourite games of all times and Bannerlord SURELY sounds promising. However, it is better to stay away until the devs finish fixing (some of) the problems above. As it is now, it is a bad game. 

No achievements, played on Linux via Proton (thanks Steam!). I will update this review once the game leaves early access!"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I just closed the game probably for the 20th time and said ""I dont know why I keep playing this game"".

The great thing about this game is it's concept. Its a lot of fun if you don't care about the crashes, absolutely dogshit AI, broken sieges, and lazy quests.

These guys have had years to improve upon a great concept, and at every turn, they come short. I find myself playing every few months, hoping they've corrected some very basic problems like Siege and Combat AI. But ... no. Nothing ever changes.

Wait for a dev team that has a clue on what they're doing to make something similar. The market is there - unfortunately Taleworlds just doesnt have the ability to deliver."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"- Glacial development pace ever since its ""early access"" release

- Boring & barebones Singleplayer experience

- Stale Multiplayer scene

- No public indication that further features will bring Singleplayer up-to-par with even a minimally modded Warband

- No hints Multiplayer will receive the breath of fresh air it desperately needs

- Mods required to make Singleplayer fun

- Modders openly angry at Talewords for arbitrarily hindering modding possibilities (affecting the most ambitious overhaul mods)

- No guarantees by Talewords that modders will have the necessary tools in the future
"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"At launch, it was great fun, the only issues were AI and broken features (perks not working, stuff like that), to be expected of early access. Much time later, the features were fixed (awesome!) but the AI is still really bad, and performance has somehow become much, much worse. 

This is why I can't recommend it. I can tolerate features being broken because the gameplay is still fun, and siege AI can be overlooked because most battles aren't sieges anyway (and Warband's siege AI was bad too). But the menu lag makes the game seriously unplayable. Game lags for like 10 seconds every time you open a menu. That doesn't sound like a long time but seriously, just count to 10 right now, it's a looong time to just sit there, and this game is seriously like 50% menus, dude. It adds up REALLY quick. A good third or so of my gameplay is just me sitting waiting for the game to stop stuttering. It's also really bizarre to me that it's just menus that do this. Battles run very smoothly for me.

I'm going back to Warband I think, I'll check back on this game in like a year and maybe it will be a bit better. Would recommend others do the same."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Review Date: 06/09/2021
Status: Not Recommended
Reason: TaleWorlds has intentionally hard coded sections of the game to make it more difficult for modders to develop new content. These changes do not improve the performance or functionality of the game. TW's Warband owed a large portion of its success to the modding community. As it stands, Bannerlord has progressed at a snails pace and continues to disappoint after years of promised features. Factions are ridiculously uneven, bugs are rampant, and the core game has very little content. In its *current* state I cannot recommend this game."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,In it's current state the game is still missing large amounts of content and is unfortunately being developed at a glacial pace.  I can't recommend it to anyone new to the franchise but it will scratch the itch for anyone with fond memories of Mount and Blade Warband.  I'll update in a few months time if this game has improved and implemented more of its features in an acceptable state.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I've bought this game upon release as I love the free-roam concept however currently without mods the game is close to unplayable eventhough it's been more than a year. I'd rather have the developer stopping patches so the mod community can just fully take over as there's not been any significant patch to the game so far but the patching is making the entire game buggy from a modding perspective.

For anyone that loves the genre, try warband with mods first as in the current state you should only pick up this game when it's presented as a budget option."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The game is great and captivating, a great blend of strategy, tactics, trading, etc ... 

But there are some major flaws, which i hope will be fixed during the game development; and i will then revise my review.

Among these, to name a few, once you become your own king and get some clans to join your faction; you then realize these clans can create armies instantly when you are at war, and you can't do anything about it. Then they go stupidly on 'errands' wasting precious war time resources. There must be a way in the future to have a general strategy and give general guidelines to your armies what they should do, etc ... not just have them in autopilot...
Another one are the ""captains"" during large battles, who are running like stupid on their horses instead of moving toward with the unit they are meant to command. they often run to death in a utterly stupid manner. Kind of game breakin immersion.

You realize all these flaws once you reach the time to become your own king and have to manage your empire. The entire slope to reach this point is really fantastic , but what a let down when you reach this point !

I really hope this gets fixed in the future !!

You can only level skills by USING them, but as they get closer to the cap, you get a multiplier penalty, e.g. you get only 1/2, then 1/4, until you get no exp at all. To mitigate that, the devs added a ""focus points"" which increases the cap/multiplier for a single skill only (max 5 focus per skill). You get 1 focus point per level, 1 attribute point per 4 levels. The progression is non-linear i.e. the higher the level of the character/skill, the more exp points it needs to progress - but you get LESS exp points due to the multiplier penalty. To eventually get max attributes, you'd need to reach lvl 200-ish.

It is much more intuitive than it sounds. The key problem is that, to level up, you need to progress skills. But to progress skills you need to level up. The non-linear behaviour is TERRIBLY balanced. Even after cheating to get all attributes to 10 (max speed/cap to all skills), after ~40h my character is barely lvl 35 (remember, non-linear; so it gets much worse later). If you try to focus in one attribute/group of skills, you'll level up even slower. Yes, in Bannerlord, specializing is bad!

Once you create a kingdom, your lords force you to declare war on every kingdom with less troops. Lords with traits such as ""Honour"" and ""Honesty"" pass their time pillaging villages. You can also send your companions to form parties to protect your own settlements, but instead they will join the murdering as well - but IN YOUR NAME! There is no ""toggle"". You can't say ""no, bad boy, sit."" You can control some policies of your kingdom, but there is no ""Chill Daddy"" policy and everybody is bloodthirsty the whole time.

I ran out of space but I could still rant about marriage, charming/persuasion, the way the NPCs creeply smile at you as if they'd had mushrooms, the lack of armor crafting, customized troops trees and of a potato at the end of this post.

Mount & Blade is one of my favourite games of all times and Bannerlord SURELY sounds promising. However, it is better to stay away until the devs finish fixing (some of) the problems above. As it is now, it is a bad game. 

No achievements, played on Linux via Proton (thanks Steam!). I will update this review once the game leaves early access!"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"- Glacial development pace ever since its ""early access"" release

- Boring & barebones Singleplayer experience

- Stale Multiplayer scene

- No public indication that further features will bring Singleplayer up-to-par with even a minimally modded Warband

- No hints Multiplayer will receive the breath of fresh air it desperately needs

- Mods required to make Singleplayer fun

- Modders openly angry at Talewords for arbitrarily hindering modding possibilities (affecting the most ambitious overhaul mods)

- No guarantees by Talewords that modders will have the necessary tools in the future
"
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"At launch, it was great fun, the only issues were AI and broken features (perks not working, stuff like that), to be expected of early access. Much time later, the features were fixed (awesome!) but the AI is still really bad, and performance has somehow become much, much worse. 

This is why I can't recommend it. I can tolerate features being broken because the gameplay is still fun, and siege AI can be overlooked because most battles aren't sieges anyway (and Warband's siege AI was bad too). But the menu lag makes the game seriously unplayable. Game lags for like 10 seconds every time you open a menu. That doesn't sound like a long time but seriously, just count to 10 right now, it's a looong time to just sit there, and this game is seriously like 50% menus, dude. It adds up REALLY quick. A good third or so of my gameplay is just me sitting waiting for the game to stop stuttering. It's also really bizarre to me that it's just menus that do this. Battles run very smoothly for me.

I'm going back to Warband I think, I'll check back on this game in like a year and maybe it will be a bit better. Would recommend others do the same."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"Review Date: 06/09/2021
Status: Not Recommended
Reason: TaleWorlds has intentionally hard coded sections of the game to make it more difficult for modders to develop new content. These changes do not improve the performance or functionality of the game. TW's Warband owed a large portion of its success to the modding community. As it stands, Bannerlord has progressed at a snails pace and continues to disappoint after years of promised features. Factions are ridiculously uneven, bugs are rampant, and the core game has very little content. In its *current* state I cannot recommend this game."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,In it's current state the game is still missing large amounts of content and is unfortunately being developed at a glacial pace.  I can't recommend it to anyone new to the franchise but it will scratch the itch for anyone with fond memories of Mount and Blade Warband.  I'll update in a few months time if this game has improved and implemented more of its features in an acceptable state.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I've bought this game upon release as I love the free-roam concept however currently without mods the game is close to unplayable eventhough it's been more than a year. I'd rather have the developer stopping patches so the mod community can just fully take over as there's not been any significant patch to the game so far but the patching is making the entire game buggy from a modding perspective.

For anyone that loves the genre, try warband with mods first as in the current state you should only pick up this game when it's presented as a budget option."
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The game is great and captivating, a great blend of strategy, tactics, trading, etc ... 

But there are some major flaws, which i hope will be fixed during the game development; and i will then revise my review.

Among these, to name a few, once you become your own king and get some clans to join your faction; you then realize these clans can create armies instantly when you are at war, and you can't do anything about it. Then they go stupidly on 'errands' wasting precious war time resources. There must be a way in the future to have a general strategy and give general guidelines to your armies what they should do, etc ... not just have them in autopilot...
Another one are the ""captains"" during large battles, who are running like stupid on their horses instead of moving toward with the unit they are meant to command. they often run to death in a utterly stupid manner. Kind of game breakin immersion.

You realize all these flaws once you reach the time to become your own king and have to manage your empire. The entire slope to reach this point is really fantastic , but what a let down when you reach this point !

I really hope this gets fixed in the future !!

DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"The only thing that pushed me to 100% this game was my love and appreciation for Dragon Ball. 

It was not worth the effort.

While the DBZ story is intact and playing out the events of it is pretty fun, that's where the pros end. This game doesn't really deliver on any other front. The combat becomes samey very quickly, the side quests are bland and uninteresting, the open world has a very random design and does not ask to be explored like other open world RPGs. If you do end up choosing to explore it, you won't be very well rewarded or entertained. The community system I only ever ended up doing for the achievement, as doing it in between story beats felt like a waste of time. The meal system I only ever used a few times outside doing the achievement, and while more useful than the community system, getting to actually make a meal is grindy and annoying.

If you're a heavily devoted DB fan, this game will still probably please you enough to produce enjoyment, but if you're a non-DB fan looking to experience the events of DBZ's story through this game, save your money"

DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"This game has good story. That's probably the only high mark I can give it.

I refunded the game shortly after given control of Piccolo when the realization came of what I'd be doing 90% of the time. Flying around collecting orbs with finicky flight controls and needing to be quite close to pick up said orbs. After failing miserably to a timed collection challenge thing I'd have seen enough. 
The fighting mechanics didn't hold me either. Goku and Piccolo have multiple supers from what I gleaned from the Super moves skill tree, but you can only bring 4 to a fight and the orb collecting is what's needed to unlock and power them up.
This game does not respect your time, that's all I can say. It doesn't deliver as an RPG or a Fighting game, both areas are equally weak!"
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"This game is real dumb. Made for 10 year old children, not actual Dragonball fans who are now 30+ years old."

"
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"We all know the story, and its told once again with great graphics and decent gameplay. Its got a cringe slow start but picks up after a bit. I like games with a narrative with some open ended busy work and this has both.

A few things that bother the hell outta me is:

 1. i have to turn on vsync to stop tearing but it locks my 60fps monitor to 30fps. 

 2. is that All-Might voices like 4 people which wouldnt be a big deal since ya know, skyrim, but when you have 3 of the 4 people talking in the same cutscene, its funny in a lame way. 

and a big one, 3. I have watched team fourstar's abridged about 7 times and its reeaally hard to go back to vanilla characters. Especially vegita. so if we could get a TFS DLC that would epic. Or at the very least a krillin owned counter.

All seriousness, the game isnt bad. The combat is pretty same ol same ol but it still feels good and the graphics and world are top tier. I was on the fence about refunding it because like i said the intro was so childishly cringe worthy that it took two senzu's to shake off. Im looking forward to cell saga but again, gonna miss the abridged version."
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,"My only real complaint with this game is the combat. It isn't fun at all. It looks cool as all hell, but it just feels bad to play. The only thing that I need for a DBZ game to do in order to be a decent game is for it to make the combat system fun to play. Kakarot does not do this at all. For all of the things that it does correctly, it failed miserably at the most important aspect of a DBZ game.

The controls feel stiff, clunky, and awkward. Some of that can be mitigated by changing up the control scheme on your own, but it still doesn't feel smooth or intuitive no matter what you do, and there are certain mechanics to it that just isn't very good. It feels frustrating and tedious, as if it was intentionally designed to not be any fun. In the short time that I've spent with the game, obviously, I haven't completely mastered the combat system. However, I don't think that matters. This doesn't feel like something you just need to ""git gud"" at. It feels like some annoying chore that you just have to put up with because you have no other choice. That is not quality game design."
DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT,RPG,851850,So this might come as a shocker to most but I have never seen one episode of DBZ and not knowing anything about the rich lore this game explains so much. I was looking for a game with good combat that was on sale because I'm cheap and this game did not disappoint.

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,Now bring Persona 5 to Steam
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,I wish chie was real
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,ayoo where's persona 3
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"I'm not used to writing long reviews on Steam whatsoever so bear with me here. However [b]Persona 4 Golden[/b] is such a gem that requires essay-long review.

If you are not into reading, I'll summarize the game shortly.

Imagine a game, that is practically timeless. Where game play and story matters more than pretty graphics and visual effects. PERSONA 4 is that game. Absolute masterpiece with amazing music, captivating story and likable characters.
--------------
I'll stay as spoiler-free as possible in this review. As everyone should go into this game blind. Trust me, reading game guides ruined some elements for me. However I might mention some things that may land into spoiler territory. You've been warned.

[i]Think of Persona as a game that doesn't have definite genre. Instead it's bunch of different sub-genres combined into one. JRPG with traditional turn-based RPG tropes, slice of life high school simulator and dating simulator in the same time. That in one package. [/i]

I went into this game completely blind. I only knew that game has RPG and slice of life elements. And quite frankly, outside of Mario and Luigi series, I've never played turn-based RPG game in my life. But after playing Persona 4 Golden, I'm eager to try out other turn-based RPG games.

You are playing as silent protagonist (canonically named Yu Narukami) who is moving to small town called Inaba for a year. Just after arriving to Inaba, town starts experiencing mysterious murder cases that police have trouble solving. One way or another, MC and his newly-found friends become entangled with murders - therefore trying to solve the case instead of unavailing local police. I can't go into greater detail about the story, but it is strongest part of this game. And like I said, I recommend experiencing it blind. But let's just say, this was first time I felt emotional during a video game (single player anyway).

Main gameplay is split into two different parts. High school life on Inaba and turn-based combat on shadow world. Each day you can decide to spend time improving your relations (such as going to movies with your friends), study to improve your social stats or enter the shadow world to solve the mystery. Game constantly reminds you that your time is limited and you should choose wisely what to do each day. As if you don't do specific tasks due to certain date, you'll be prompted with game over (or more specifically, rewind time). 

Combat feels great in this game. You and your friends can perform all sorts of attacks/spells ranging from physical attacks to elemental attacks and obviously buffs/debuffs. Each enemy type has its own strength and weakness that you can exploit to your own advantage. Enemies can also reflect and absorb your attacks so learning enemy weaknesses are beneficial part of combat. Sometimes you may even need to swap out certain characters as they may be in significant disadvantage on some boss fights. However I found every character to be perfectly balanced and usable in almost any situation (if built carefully). 

Somewhat major flaw I did find from leveling system though. If playing on lower difficulty level (as I did for start), it is very easy to over level, which makes game too easy (i'm serious, just play the game on hard difficulty for very least). To level up, you have to defeat monsters on shadow world. So I did the obvious and changed difficulty of the game. And oh boy, leveling becomes extremely tedious on end of the game. You aren't forced to level your characters, however it grants stat-increases and new spells for your persona, which helps tremendously. On later dungeons, only non-time consuming way to level is to eliminate [spoiler]golden hands[/spoiler] that are very annoying to slay. 

Also I found enemy types to be very generic reskins of older opponents you face on lower leveled dungeons. HOWEVER this is explained in the game itself so I let it slide.

These are only complaints I have with the game though (and I presume most RPG games have this ""problem"" anyways). But during mid game, I avoided combat like plague in order to avoid plain grinding -  [spoiler]only to max out every character by the end and being ridiculously strong during final boss /shrug.[/spoiler]

Slice of life game play is surprisingly fun though. Game establishes very early on that your strength heavily depends on your social links with other people around you. So during the day and after school, your goal is to both increase your social stats and solve your friends' problems. You can only do limited tasks per day though so you have to choose wisely how you invest your day. Perhaps you want to increase your understanding stat, but you [strike]need[/strike] want to hang out with Yosuke. Or maybe you need to enter shadow world instead. Constant feel of pressure is somehow very fitting and adds replayability to multiple playthroughs as you can choose to go through events differently that time around. Dating aspect also adds to this. 

Outside of gameplay, Persona 4 also has scripted cutscenes/events that provide excellent piece of humor and plot twists. I don't know how many times I thought story was going to end, only to find out that game had barely even started. Once you play the game, you know exactly what I mean. Story throws you off multiple times.

What I was very surprised about was that Persona 4 has so much content, that it kept throwing new stuff at me every moment. In fact, I was playing the endgame dungeon and still found out something new that game has to offer. You may question how I managed to spend over 100 hours on single playthrough. But I seriously wanted to experience everything this game had to offer. I was so addicted. And still managed to miss half of the game's content. This is as I missed most social links, didn't max my social stats and missed some events. Which I will happily come back to with NEW GAME+ in year or two. Oh, and did I mention that this game has [spoiler]multiple endings[/spoiler]?

Like I mentioned before, Persona 4 may not have the prettier graphics, in fact this Steam version is just a port of PS VITA game from 2012 which was rerelease of PS2 game from 2008. However it doesn't need fancy graphics. Even if character models feel clunky sometimes, voice acting and artwork makes it up. Character animation itself still looks decent today. Also not to forget that Golden has some animated shorts that are used as cinematic set pieces from Persona 4 Animation that still looks good to this day. 

Crown jewel of this game though absolutely is the [b]SOUNDTRACK[/b]. Persona games are known for their excellent soundtrack and P4G does not disappoint. Not gonna lie, this was first time I felt like dancing while playing a game. I mean seriously, you don't even need to buy the game for its soundtrack. It is available for free on Spotify. Never expected vocal tracks to work this well with turn-based combat. I absolutely adore guitar usage as well. But yep, buckle up, time to jam out during combat. Time to make history.

But all I'm trying to say is that you should absolutely give this game a try (especially now that SEGA owns Atlus and they'll most likely release Persona 5 port soon. Pretty please). Even if you aren't fan of anime or JRPG games, I found it to be one of those games that are enjoyable despite having no background on certain genre. For me that being turn-based RPGs and high school sims. 

And I know this review is very messy. Perhaps I'll fix it some day, just like how I'll 100% this game some day too. Only time will tell. In mean time, check out this [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CujlchNaHNc]2 hour long analysis video[/url] by Nam's Compendium - if you are interested. It sums up pretty much everything I want to say and what the game has to offer. Containing spoilers obviously.

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"P4G was one of those game that almost ALMOST tempt me to buy a vita, i am really glad that it came to pc.

I felt that it is unfair to compare it to P3 or P5 series as game play, UI and quality of life continuously improve over each series. But one thing is for sure, no matter which series they ALL have kickass soundtrack

For people that have never play a persona series before, the tldr version of persona is pretty much sim+rpg you need to balance both mystery solving and friendship building to succeed in this game.

For ppl who enjoy both visual novel and jrpg do check this game out.

Lastly, hope they bring P3 and P5R into steam, i would gladly play those two again.

Lastly lastly, felt that Yukiko is kind of underrated so wanted to give her a shout out"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,Yukiko is the only way
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Persona 4 Golden prompted many to buy a Playstation Vita years after its release, just to play this game. That should tell you everything you need to know about how high the quality of P4G is. While the randomly-generated dungeons and art style are dated by this point, especially when compared to the painstakingly-polished presentation of Persona 5, this story and the characters within it will draw the interest of anybody who can get past the overly long introductory section characteristic of the more recent installments in the series. Once beyond that, however, players will find themselves within an addictive gameplay loop involving dungeon crawling through an elemental weakness, turn-based combat system familiar to fans of Shin Megami Tensei and Pokemon alike, as well as a social simulator requiring both time management and an understanding of the availability of their friends to maximize the content they experience throughout their playthrough. This back-and-forth is largely addictive, drawing players into the lives of several characters, which often highlight the struggles of adolescence and the meaning of ""truth,"" but there is some varying quality among the social links that are either less interesting or unappealing in personality. 

While on the topic of cons, players of the following game may find themselves surprised by the fact that they'll need to grind to get all party members to the same range of levels, as only those in the party get experience from battles. The process of knowing what level one needs to be in an area is very much trial-and-error, which can result in aggravating deaths followed by grind sessions to raise you and your party's level to fuse more powerful Personas. Ultimately, though, the process of using skill cards and fusing personas to build a powerful team with a wide array of elemental strengths to cover the spread of possible weaknesses ends up being a (mostly) satisfying experience that can scratch some of the Pokedex itch through filling the Compendium of possible creations.

Lastly, story is an important component of a game with as daunting a runtime as any of the Persona games. The story of P4G is a far more understated affair when compared to the world-ending, metropolitan escapades of P3 and P5, revolving around a small-town murder mystery and ""seeking out the truth."" Social links often involve relationships between family members, unspoken feelings, and personal weaknesses, frequently culminating in realizations of personal and/or objective ""truth."" This theme carries out within the stellar soundtrack, particularly within the battle theme. Other tracks cover the spread of poppy sounds, from the head bopping ""Sounds of Love"" to the wistful ""Snowflakes."" All said and done, the main story has some twists and turns, ultimately being good enough to run alongside the social links and combat mechanics and bring the game to a satisfying conclusion. Perhaps expected, the story does suffer a bit from some anime trope-iness that adds some of the ""fate of humanity"" elements from the other games in the series, but this does little to tarnish what is executed well here.

CONS:
-Long-ass introduction section
-Buy a few tickets to Grind City if you like to be overly prepared for bosses/mini-bosses
-Slight plot tropes characteristic of recent Persona series entries
-Expectedly dated visuals and dungeon generation system

PROS:
-Consistent themes and interesting characters
-Social simulator aspect of the game is top-tier
-Soundtrack is top-tier
-Main story being a mystery keeps interest involved
-Persona Compendium and fusing a fun distraction

OneLine: If you like JRPGs, anime, and have no real social life, this will temporarily make your miserable life happy with polygonal friends for around 80 hours

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,Now bring Persona 5 to Steam

Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,ayoo where's persona 3
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"I'm not used to writing long reviews on Steam whatsoever so bear with me here. However [b]Persona 4 Golden[/b] is such a gem that requires essay-long review.

If you are not into reading, I'll summarize the game shortly.

Imagine a game, that is practically timeless. Where game play and story matters more than pretty graphics and visual effects. PERSONA 4 is that game. Absolute masterpiece with amazing music, captivating story and likable characters.
--------------
I'll stay as spoiler-free as possible in this review. As everyone should go into this game blind. Trust me, reading game guides ruined some elements for me. However I might mention some things that may land into spoiler territory. You've been warned.

[i]Think of Persona as a game that doesn't have definite genre. Instead it's bunch of different sub-genres combined into one. JRPG with traditional turn-based RPG tropes, slice of life high school simulator and dating simulator in the same time. That in one package. [/i]

I went into this game completely blind. I only knew that game has RPG and slice of life elements. And quite frankly, outside of Mario and Luigi series, I've never played turn-based RPG game in my life. But after playing Persona 4 Golden, I'm eager to try out other turn-based RPG games.

You are playing as silent protagonist (canonically named Yu Narukami) who is moving to small town called Inaba for a year. Just after arriving to Inaba, town starts experiencing mysterious murder cases that police have trouble solving. One way or another, MC and his newly-found friends become entangled with murders - therefore trying to solve the case instead of unavailing local police. I can't go into greater detail about the story, but it is strongest part of this game. And like I said, I recommend experiencing it blind. But let's just say, this was first time I felt emotional during a video game (single player anyway).

Main gameplay is split into two different parts. High school life on Inaba and turn-based combat on shadow world. Each day you can decide to spend time improving your relations (such as going to movies with your friends), study to improve your social stats or enter the shadow world to solve the mystery. Game constantly reminds you that your time is limited and you should choose wisely what to do each day. As if you don't do specific tasks due to certain date, you'll be prompted with game over (or more specifically, rewind time). 

Combat feels great in this game. You and your friends can perform all sorts of attacks/spells ranging from physical attacks to elemental attacks and obviously buffs/debuffs. Each enemy type has its own strength and weakness that you can exploit to your own advantage. Enemies can also reflect and absorb your attacks so learning enemy weaknesses are beneficial part of combat. Sometimes you may even need to swap out certain characters as they may be in significant disadvantage on some boss fights. However I found every character to be perfectly balanced and usable in almost any situation (if built carefully). 

Somewhat major flaw I did find from leveling system though. If playing on lower difficulty level (as I did for start), it is very easy to over level, which makes game too easy (i'm serious, just play the game on hard difficulty for very least). To level up, you have to defeat monsters on shadow world. So I did the obvious and changed difficulty of the game. And oh boy, leveling becomes extremely tedious on end of the game. You aren't forced to level your characters, however it grants stat-increases and new spells for your persona, which helps tremendously. On later dungeons, only non-time consuming way to level is to eliminate [spoiler]golden hands[/spoiler] that are very annoying to slay. 

Also I found enemy types to be very generic reskins of older opponents you face on lower leveled dungeons. HOWEVER this is explained in the game itself so I let it slide.

These are only complaints I have with the game though (and I presume most RPG games have this ""problem"" anyways). But during mid game, I avoided combat like plague in order to avoid plain grinding -  [spoiler]only to max out every character by the end and being ridiculously strong during final boss /shrug.[/spoiler]

Slice of life game play is surprisingly fun though. Game establishes very early on that your strength heavily depends on your social links with other people around you. So during the day and after school, your goal is to both increase your social stats and solve your friends' problems. You can only do limited tasks per day though so you have to choose wisely how you invest your day. Perhaps you want to increase your understanding stat, but you [strike]need[/strike] want to hang out with Yosuke. Or maybe you need to enter shadow world instead. Constant feel of pressure is somehow very fitting and adds replayability to multiple playthroughs as you can choose to go through events differently that time around. Dating aspect also adds to this. 

Outside of gameplay, Persona 4 also has scripted cutscenes/events that provide excellent piece of humor and plot twists. I don't know how many times I thought story was going to end, only to find out that game had barely even started. Once you play the game, you know exactly what I mean. Story throws you off multiple times.

What I was very surprised about was that Persona 4 has so much content, that it kept throwing new stuff at me every moment. In fact, I was playing the endgame dungeon and still found out something new that game has to offer. You may question how I managed to spend over 100 hours on single playthrough. But I seriously wanted to experience everything this game had to offer. I was so addicted. And still managed to miss half of the game's content. This is as I missed most social links, didn't max my social stats and missed some events. Which I will happily come back to with NEW GAME+ in year or two. Oh, and did I mention that this game has [spoiler]multiple endings[/spoiler]?

Like I mentioned before, Persona 4 may not have the prettier graphics, in fact this Steam version is just a port of PS VITA game from 2012 which was rerelease of PS2 game from 2008. However it doesn't need fancy graphics. Even if character models feel clunky sometimes, voice acting and artwork makes it up. Character animation itself still looks decent today.

I felt that it is unfair to compare it to P3 or P5 series as game play, UI and quality of life continuously improve over each series. But one thing is for sure, no matter which series they ALL have kickass soundtrack

For people that have never play a persona series before, the tldr version of persona is pretty much sim+rpg you need to balance both mystery solving and friendship building to succeed in this game.

For ppl who enjoy both visual novel and jrpg do check this game out.

Lastly, hope they bring P3 and P5R into steam, i would gladly play those two again.

Lastly lastly, felt that Yukiko is kind of underrated so wanted to give her a shout out"
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,Yukiko is the only way
Persona 4 Golden,RPG,1113000,"Persona 4 Golden prompted many to buy a Playstation Vita years after its release, just to play this game. That should tell you everything you need to know about how high the quality of P4G is. While the randomly-generated dungeons and art style are dated by this point, especially when compared to the painstakingly-polished presentation of Persona 5, this story and the characters within it will draw the interest of anybody who can get past the overly long introductory section characteristic of the more recent installments in the series. Once beyond that, however, players will find themselves within an addictive gameplay loop involving dungeon crawling through an elemental weakness, turn-based combat system familiar to fans of Shin Megami Tensei and Pokemon alike, as well as a social simulator requiring both time management and an understanding of the availability of their friends to maximize the content they experience throughout their playthrough. This back-and-forth is largely addictive, drawing players into the lives of several characters, which often highlight the struggles of adolescence and the meaning of ""truth,"" but there is some varying quality among the social links that are either less interesting or unappealing in personality. 

While on the topic of cons, players of the following game may find themselves surprised by the fact that they'll need to grind to get all party members to the same range of levels, as only those in the party get experience from battles. The process of knowing what level one needs to be in an area is very much trial-and-error, which can result in aggravating deaths followed by grind sessions to raise you and your party's level to fuse more powerful Personas. Ultimately, though, the process of using skill cards and fusing personas to build a powerful team with a wide array of elemental strengths to cover the spread of possible weaknesses ends up being a (mostly) satisfying experience that can scratch some of the Pokedex itch through filling the Compendium of possible creations.

Lastly, story is an important component of a game with as daunting a runtime as any of the Persona games. The story of P4G is a far more understated affair when compared to the world-ending, metropolitan escapades of P3 and P5, revolving around a small-town murder mystery and ""seeking out the truth."" Social links often involve relationships between family members, unspoken feelings, and personal weaknesses, frequently culminating in realizations of personal and/or objective ""truth."" This theme carries out within the stellar soundtrack, particularly within the battle theme. Other tracks cover the spread of poppy sounds, from the head bopping ""Sounds of Love"" to the wistful ""Snowflakes."" All said and done, the main story has some twists and turns, ultimately being good enough to run alongside the social links and combat mechanics and bring the game to a satisfying conclusion. Perhaps expected, the story does suffer a bit from some anime trope-iness that adds some of the ""fate of humanity"" elements from the other games in the series, but this does little to tarnish what is executed well here.

CONS:
-Long-ass introduction section
-Buy a few tickets to Grind City if you like to be overly prepared for bosses/mini-bosses
-Slight plot tropes characteristic of recent Persona series entries
-Expectedly dated visuals and dungeon generation system

PROS:
-Consistent themes and interesting characters
-Social simulator aspect of the game is top-tier
-Soundtrack is top-tier
-Main story being a mystery keeps interest involved
-Persona Compendium and fusing a fun distraction

OneLine: If you like JRPGs, anime, and have no real social life, this will temporarily make your miserable life happy with polygonal friends for around 80 hours

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"Best story of any game I have ever played.

Also has severe racism and slavery.

Awesome 10/10."
The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"Many people (myself included) feel that the gaming industry, and media in general; has changed over the years. Some of it was inevitable. With the Internet more accessible than ever, it's understandably difficult to create a sense of mystery. The late 90s and early 2000s were a different time, and a lot of the experiences people remember simply can't be recaptured because they were exclusive and dependent to that time and the limitations of technology of the day.

However, I'd say the mindset of the industry itself has shifted. A focus on mass appeal is clearly more prevalent. In fairness, the market being catered to has also shifted significantly since 2002 due to the reasons above and others, such as games being seen as an equivalent entertainment medium to cinema and TV instead of just a nerdy pastime. Companies like Bethesda are just doing what corporations do by changing their strategy. I'm not trying to excuse any of their actions in recent years, I'm just illustrating that it's all par for the course.

That's not what I'm here to discuss, though.

Morrowind is truly Bethesda at their finest. It's an experience like no other, from an era when innovation and creativity were strong in the gaming industry. In my opinion, the developers didn't seem to be attempting to please anyone aside from themselves. This doesn't feel at all like the product of an unfeeling corporation, as many more modern games do to an extent (in my opinion).

When you get off that boat in Seyda Neen, you are a pathetic nobody. A weakling dressed in rags. You suck at everything, including walking. You will be awkwardly ""hobbling"" (to use a generous term) around for a good chunk of the early game.

This game doesn't hand you anything, but if you're willing to put the effort into learning its systems and rules, there are no limits to what you can accomplish. The design of the game blurs the line between features and exploits in the best possible way. I'm not exaggerating when I say for any frustration you have with the gameplay, there is a way around it. Trust me, by the end of your playthrough, you'll be something very different from the filthy prisoner nobody you start out as.

You literally become a God. Similar to the Dragonborn arc in Skyrim, but much more epic and executed in a much more satisfying way.

Little advice
The beginning of the game can be frustrating and slow. STICK WITH IT. Don't be afraid to toggle off auto-run and cautiously approach enemies, especially early in the game. That green fatigue bar is deceptively important. The higher your fatigue, the better chance you have of hitting an enemy, casting a spell, or doing literally anything else.

You're on your own now. Good luck."
The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"With not much interesting gaming going on these days I thought it would be cool to revisit a classic. So here's what's what.

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind in an RPG like no other. Apparently written under the rule of psychoactive drugs, it climaxes in a bizarre that is both zodiacal and surreal. The adventure takes place in Vvardenfell, an island closer to the extraterrestrial rather than the fantastical. It  is a vessel of the game's penchant for amalgamation, be it of tribal cultures and rival civilizations, apocryphal beliefs and astral prophecies, revanchist doctrines and occult interests or carnal desires and transcendental ambitions. Between cynical politicians and embodied deities (some of them false, by the way), drug dealers and infernal powers, the player experiences a unique sensation of freedom. Not just freedom of action in the way they choose their course, but also freedom of thought as they follow ascension along a path of Machiavelian pragmatism or simply forlorn wandering in the pursuit of divinity. 

With the game being almost two decades old by now, it can be a bit of a headache to get it to run smoothly on present-day machines. However, there's plenty of written and video guides that cover the essentials. Particularly if you care about a minimal installation featuring hardware compatibility and bug fixing (the only things that are truly needed to enjoy the game, in my opinion), you can get everything set up in under an hour. It's totally worth it, because by the time you've set foot in Morrowind, you'll be scratching your head and wondering why people stopped making games like this."

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22320,"Bat Out of Hell is the 1977 debut album by American rock singer Meat Loaf and composer Jim Steinman. It was developed from a musical, Neverland, a futuristic rock version of Peter Pan, which Steinman wrote for a workshop in 1974. The album was recorded during 1975–1976 at various studios, including Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, produced by Todd Rundgren, and released in October 1977 by Cleveland International/Epic Records.[2] Its musical style is influenced by Steinman's appreciation of Richard Wagner, Phil Spector, Bruce Springsteen and The Who. Bat Out of Hell has spawned two Meat Loaf sequel albums: Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell and Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose.

Bat Out of Hell is one of the best-selling albums of all time, having sold over 50 million copies worldwide.[3] It is certified 14x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[4] As of June 2019, it has spent 522 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, the second longest chart run by a studio album.[5] Rolling Stone ranked it at number 343 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[6][7]

A musical based on Bat Out of Hell, staged by Jay Scheib, opened at the Manchester Opera House on February 17, 2017, before transferring to the London Coliseum and Toronto's Ed Mirvish Theatre in late 2017.[8] April 2, 2018 till January 5, 2019 it was running at the Dominion Theatre, London,[9] with plans to run the show in parallel in Germany[10] and in a tour of the United States in 2019, however, the American tour was canceled during its early performances.[11]"

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"A timeless classic and a masterpiece, a must-play if you're new to the Witcher series. This game will make you feel like a real Witcher through smart use of many gameplay mechanics such as potions, signs, sword oils and such. Combat is a bit clunky but it is easy to get used to, and if you time your dodges and play smart, and of course if you strenghten yourself with necessary potions before combat, the monsters will feel the wrath of a proper monster slayer

Story 10/10
Gameplay 8/10
Graphics (for its time) 9/10

Overall 9/10

Playing for the 3rd time, this game never gets boring or repetetive. Especially after watching the show, and playing the third game, returning to the Witcher 2 was a welcoming experience. Seeing familiar faces and assessing them through a difference perspective with the knowledge of The Witcher 3, books and the Netflix show really add alot to the story. If you're new to the series, obviously your perspective will be more of a discover's, but if you're a returning player, you will be the observer and you will understand certain plot aspects even more comprehensively.

A must-play and defenitely worth a re-play after the third game.

And of course, if you have the time and the interest for Witcher universe, I would suggest playing both paths the game provides to the player. They're both unique paths and act as stand-alone games where the story, places you visit and the characters you meet completely changes."

It was arguably more bloody and gritty, with a harsher dialogue and plot than the other two.

I did have a bit of trouble running the game during one of the first missons (though I saw others had a similar problem and it was quickly solved)

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"The Witcher 2 is less about Witchering and more about how a Witcher is trapped around the political machinations of the Northern Kingdoms, It's Sorceresses and how it intertwined with the Third Nilfgaardian War.

Throughout the campaign you are forced to take a side either, first it's either team Blue (Roche) or team green (Iorveth), then in support of ruler A or ruler B, or help a sorceress or not, but thankfully the player is given an opportunity to maintain the stance of neutrality as a true Witcher and that taking sides was merely choosing the lesser evil rather than wholeheartedly support one kingdom after the other, however all depends entirely to your chosen dialogue. In terms of gameplay this makes the ending showcases a different outcome depending on the results that unfold because of your choice, which might carry different dialogues on Witcher 3. 

In terms of story I say this is a brilliant, in my opinion. People most likely don't like W2 story because it's rather confusing for newer players and full of political intrigues and conspiracy, key events that shaped the story in W2 (like the Battle of Brenna, Thanedd coup, the dissolving of the Brotherhood of Sorceress and lastly the formation of The Lodge of Sorceresses) isn't shown in-game, and explained either by text or by a bit of dialogues with certain key characters which can easily be missed.

Gameplay wise, is a quantum leap from W1 but a step behind W3. It's a proper action now rather than point and click action Diablo style of W1. The world isn't open like W3, but one medium sized map each chapter (there are 3), but still interesting because it has quality quests, every quest has its own twists rather than uninteresting filler quests (like AC:Odyssesy) but the same cannot be said for contract quests because they are are not interesting not like Witcher 3, it's only for making money. Potions have to be taken outside battle, by meditating (a bit more realistic but more hassle), signs especially Quen is needed because you often had to fight in cramped space, other than quen, Igni is the most useful along with axii (for cutscene), Aard for shielded enemy and Yrden is basically useless (you can slash Wraiths without Yrden).

The story and writing is excellent, dialogues and voice acting are excellent, these are what I like most about the game.
 
I have more hours than what is shown, by playing on another platform. So 40 hours is about the length of a single playthrough (all quests done on one story branch).

So if you're a fan of Witcher 3 (most likely the entry point game for new Witcher fans) and liked the lore, and never played the other , buy this, recommended. Just wait for sales (Witcher Series are often on sale including W1, if it's not on Steam, other platform like gog) if you're in doubt."

Todas las elecciones ofrecidas  de cara a construir un hilo narrativo multinivel de primera categoría, resultando en un juego de rol e intriga política a la altura del universo concebido por Sapkowski, además de mantenerse mecánicamente interesante de principio a fin.

El sistema de combate, aunque polarizante, me ha resultado divertidísimo y sorprendentemente respetuoso con la agencia del jugador.

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"I played all 3 Witcher games and this one would be the third if I must rank them. I felt too much like an ""already made"" hero in this one. It was too linear and short for my taste. I didn´t feel the immersion as in other two. But it was also full of story on the other hand. I feel like the developers were trying a different approach from the first one and it wasn´t always the best approach. But overall it is balanced, you can make a lot of visible decisions and the story was really interesting.

I liked: all minigames (controls really suited me and the animations were nice),
visual side of the game,
story was interesting and well explained in the end,
characters were convincing and I really cared about them.

I didn´t like:
map - navigating and map were horrible,
inventory - names instead of pictures (I somehow got used to it after time but still didn´t like it),
you don´t have a free movement, it is the same movement system as in 1st Witcher,
music was not bad but also not really memorable,
story choices could be more ""explained"" I would like to have more evidence to base my decisions on,
there is no Yennefer, still only Triss (I feel that she would deserve to be there. Geralt could go to find her after the final talk with Letho. It could also make the game longer as I find it really short.)

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,Runs perfectly on Linux. (Thanks to all involved for supporting Linux.)
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"A timeless classic and a masterpiece, a must-play if you're new to the Witcher series. This game will make you feel like a real Witcher through smart use of many gameplay mechanics such as potions, signs, sword oils and such. Combat is a bit clunky but it is easy to get used to, and if you time your dodges and play smart, and of course if you strenghten yourself with necessary potions before combat, the monsters will feel the wrath of a proper monster slayer

Story 10/10
Gameplay 8/10
Graphics (for its time) 9/10

Overall 9/10

Playing for the 3rd time, this game never gets boring or repetetive. Especially after watching the show, and playing the third game, returning to the Witcher 2 was a welcoming experience. Seeing familiar faces and assessing them through a difference perspective with the knowledge of The Witcher 3, books and the Netflix show really add alot to the story. If you're new to the series, obviously your perspective will be more of a discover's, but if you're a returning player, you will be the observer and you will understand certain plot aspects even more comprehensively.

A must-play and defenitely worth a re-play after the third game.

And of course, if you have the time and the interest for Witcher universe, I would suggest playing both paths the game provides to the player. They're both unique paths and act as stand-alone games where the story, places you visit and the characters you meet completely changes."

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"This is a game that you can replay and experience an entirely different story. Though choices in this game sometimes do give the illusion of choice, I felt I was actually making an impact on the story and path. 
It was arguably more bloody and gritty, with a harsher dialogue and plot than the other two.

I did have a bit of trouble running the game during one of the first missons (though I saw others had a similar problem and it was quickly solved) 

Graphics and aesthetics of the game look so good and characters (cough Iorveth cough) definitely are a hightlight of the game with their developement and backgrounds. I could go on but I think the game can speak for itself."

And as soon as it stops, the fight starts and it's impossible to drink the potion in combat. Seriously....
The user interface is everything but convenient, and the camera isn't better. It's too near from the character, so when you want to pick up items, you can't see them on the screen so you loose time trying to pick it..."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"This game is just as great as the day it released. Save often. Die often. Repeat. Slow progress is better than no progress. It also sets up The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in many ways, including importing save files, which can have more impact than I would have suspected. If you were like me, and had actually played TW3 first, and then went back and played this one, it is absolutely worthwhile.  I will warn that this game is not nearly as easy as TW3. Wild Hunt on its hardest difficulty is about equal to this game on normal. Save often."

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"Great game. Just a little bit unoptimized, but most complaining people are actually trying to run it on a 1992 bread toaster and getting surprised that it's not running above 60 FPS. But yeah, some small troubles."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,RPG,20920,"The Witcher 2 is less about Witchering and more about how a Witcher is trapped around the political machinations of the Northern Kingdoms, It's Sorceresses and how it intertwined with the Third Nilfgaardian War.

Throughout the campaign you are forced to take a side either, first it's either team Blue (Roche) or team green (Iorveth), then in support of ruler A or ruler B, or help a sorceress or not, but thankfully the player is given an opportunity to maintain the stance of neutrality as a true Witcher and that taking sides was merely choosing the lesser evil rather than wholeheartedly support one kingdom after the other, however all depends entirely to your chosen dialogue. In terms of gameplay this makes the ending showcases a different outcome depending on the results that unfold because of your choice, which might carry different dialogues on Witcher 3. 

In terms of story I say this is a brilliant, in my opinion. People most likely don't like W2 story because it's rather confusing for newer players and full of political intrigues and conspiracy, key events that shaped the story in W2 (like the Battle of Brenna, Thanedd coup, the dissolving of the Brotherhood of Sorceress and lastly the formation of The Lodge of Sorceresses) isn't shown in-game, and explained either by text or by a bit of dialogues with certain key characters which can easily be missed.

Gameplay wise, is a quantum leap from W1 but a step behind W3. It's a proper action now rather than point and click action Diablo style of W1. The world isn't open like W3, but one medium sized map each chapter (there are 3), but still interesting because it has quality quests, every quest has its own twists rather than uninteresting filler quests (like AC:Odyssesy) but the same cannot be said for contract quests because they are are not interesting not like Witcher 3, it's only for making money. Potions have to be taken outside battle, by meditating (a bit more realistic but more hassle), signs especially Quen is needed because you often had to fight in cramped space, other than quen, Igni is the most useful along with axii (for cutscene), Aard for shielded enemy and Yrden is basically useless (you can slash Wraiths without Yrden).

The story and writing is excellent, dialogues and voice acting are excellent, these are what I like most about the game.
 
I have more hours than what is shown, by playing on another platform. So 40 hours is about the length of a single playthrough (all quests done on one story branch).

HARDCORE TO THE MEGA"
Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"TLDR: I highly recommend watching the first 30mins of actual gameplay on youtube before buying this game.

This is a VERY niche game and definitely not for everyone. Like many others, I fell into the trap of buying this game based on the multitude of 10/10 critic reviews, awards and beautiful screenshots. I tried to like this game, but towards the end, I honestly didn't care what happened to the protagonist anymore. I just wanted to finish the game for completeness. 

Progress in this game is almost 100% via dialogue. Most of this dialogue, especially in the beginning, is world building. Tedious information about social, economic and political structures of Revachol. I now know more about Revachol than I do about my hometown. The rest of the dialogue occurs within your mind. This was much more enjoyable. This was where the character building and role-playing takes place, and the options are very entertaining.

Where this game ultimately fails is that there are hard stops to progress based on your attributes. I was lucky I still had side quests to complete that allowed me to earn enough xp and level that particular attribute. Otherwise you would have to reload and get lucky with the dice roll, killing the immersion. 

To list the other aspects...
Pros:
- Artwork: amazing stylised art
- Voice acting: amazing, but seeing how the game is 100% dialogue, this has to be good.
- Freedom: to handle situations any way you want (with the exception of those hard stops, which really screw the game)
- Music: very good, and compliments the game well.

Con (just one, but it's major):
- Story: honestly I found the plot boring and frustrating. Revachol might as well be any country that has undergone a revolution. Nothing new here. The main plot is frustrating because everyone is just screwing with you. I was hopeful the personal plot would be something amazing, but was anticlimactic. By the end of the game, I was bored out of my mind. 

I cannot recommend this game to the average gamer. I repeat, this game is VERY niche.
Personally, I would get more satisfaction from reading a good book."

I first played through this early December 2020 and have constantly found myself wanting to come back and start another play through where I do something completely different than the last two times.

How you choose to investigate the murder (or even IF you choose to investigate it) are completely up to the player's discretion. You can be a hard boiled no-nonsense authoritarian, a judicious and fair investigator, an intimidating renegade cop, a smooth talking manipulator, sly and wily seducer, or any other type of person justified in the game's 24 different skills in the skill tree. All the while these skills will constantly be tested and rolled against like a traditional RPG with dice rolling mechanics. Your individual path to success or ""failure"" will depend on what mix of skills, attributes, and equipment you choose. 

The musical ambiance is subtle but atmospheric, and the beautifully drawn backgrounds and environments are a joy to wander around.

Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,RPG,632470,"I keep fighting the urge to replay this game and tell myself that it’s because I’ll enjoy it the more I wait and forget details of the story.  The truth is I’m afraid that if I play through it again it will dispel some of the magic and it won’t mean the same thing to me any more.

It was that much of an experience for me."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"I started the Legend of Heroes series last year before the pandemic. On my review for Trails in the Sky, I asked myself the question. Is it better than Final Fantasy? After 9 games and 940+ hours, that answer is yes, absolutely.

What a gem and I can't believe I'm caught up now. I look forward to the next Heroes story <3"
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"Poorly paced, act 2 was a slog, the curse is terrible writing, the bonding events are poor, the harem is shit, and the music isn't quite up to nihon falcom par.

a disappointing finale to Western Zemuria. 6/10. I'm really sad, because I liked CS3 as well. Go enjoy Sky or Crossbell instead of wasting your time on CS4."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"The epic ending to cold steel saga, and it left me wanting for more. I started Cold Steel 1 54days ago, and 572hours later I have completely finished the entire series. Can't wait for Hajimari no Kiseki and hope it gets announced soon.

The Romance was decent, however the harem antics in this were forced and felt bad, Rean clearly only has eyes for Alisa in this, who is often called the ""main heroine"" and it really shows in his interactions in this. Its even better if you carry over a save file from CS3, as the development between them gets even deeper! It feels like Falcom really understood how a real relationship works, including all the troubles that might come with one. The Story in this game is one of its strongest points, but the lovey dovey mushy wushy romancing stuff honestly kept me going because I really wanted to see the ending.

I was able to get a lot of bond characters to their max bond in this to see their final scenes, however I did not like how they all basically forced themselves on him, especially since they all happened after a very specific scene at the midgame which sets up Alisa's relationship with Rean for the rest of it! It felt like they were taking advantage of his situation.

The final chapter with those 5minutes timer was the most tension I've ever felt in a video game and I really congratulate Falcom for doing that.

I didn't know Falcom at all past a few of the older Ys Games and passing mentions from friends, and honestly I'm really glad my friend told me to go buy Cold Steel 1 when it went on sale. I got what I consider world class world building and character development that puts so many other big JRPGs like Final Fantasy and Tales to absolute shame. Falcom has shown me that good JRPGs still exist that still hold firm to traditional mechanics, and you can consider me a Nihon Falcom fan for life."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"While I would recommend this game as it finishes the Erebonian arc and ties up most loose ends, they are a lot of glaring issues plaguing the game and more crucially, Falcom's direction with the series. 

-Rant incoming-
There's a ton of plot contrivance packed with typical JRPG troupes, characters appearing in the nick of time to save the day and a whole load of other shenanigans. The ""power of friendship"" troupe is especially prevalent here. Falcom's typical stellar musical compositions are also not on display in this game. A portion of tracks are remixes or taken from the previous games, while the newer songs lack the musical complexity of the older games. I personally feel the series has devolved with each passing entry, both in terms of plot writing and music. The Liberl arc gave us solid world building and great characters. Crossbell gave us tense political intrigue. The Erebonian arc had an interesting story set-up that just goes full-blown into ""power of friendship"" territory by CS4. After such a strong set-up, the finale just seems so disappointing. 

I just hope Falcom does better with Calvard's arc.  

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"Trails of Cold Steel IV: The End of Saga... but not really.

It is the last Cold Steel game in name, it wraps up the Erebonia Arc in a kinda satisfying way. Would love it if [spoiler] dead people stays dead [/spoiler] but all in all, a good conclusion to the Erebonia Arc, BUT, it is not really the end of Trails series.

It might be the Fourth Game in the ""Cold Steel"" series but I cannot recommend this to anyone if they only played Cold Steel games in the Trails franchise. So many characters from past arc presented in this game that it's necessary to know them beforehand or you'll be at loss most of the time.

NIS America, waiting for Hajimari news now! Don't take too long, we're waiting"
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"Unfortunately the story has completely gone to shit at this particular point in the series, and story is a large majority of the reason this series drew so many fans in in the first place

Major plot points feel like a slap to the face, the writers seemed to have written themselves into a corner and are just taking the completely easy way out. Some foreshadowing just turned out to be complete jokes and character writing is just down the gutter as everyone turns into a Bean Whozer fanboy/girl

I have not even finished the game at this particular point of writing and honestly after the last plot reveal of act 2 I just completely lost the will to continue the game. Old characters come back for nostalgia baiting but do not particular contribute much to the disaster that is the Sen series.

Gone is the political tension from the Crossbell series despite how much Falcom tries to write it in and gone are the good character writing and world building that the series is known for since the Liberl arc

Go and play the previous Legend of Heroes series if you want to experience good story, because the Cold Steel series absolutely does not provide any of it here."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"+ Lively world: Typical for this series, almost every character including NPCs have some kind of background story. Therefore I talked to every single NPC after each major plot advance (or even some minor advance). 
+ Continuining/End of a saga/story: Brought the built-up started from the very first game Trails in the Sky to a conclusion. However, there are lots of mysteries for later games left. Many references to previous titles.
+ Fun turn-based battle system: Same as previous titles with some nerfes. 
+ Good music: Although it went down from awesome, it is still good overall. There are some weird placements of reused music from prior titles though.
+ Good port: Played with mid-high settings without any issues (I'm easy to satisfy though).

~ Dungeons are pretty long. The Skip animation button and speed up button helped.

- There is a bonus scene after the True Ending which seem to activate after you made a clear save. To see it I reloaded the non-clear save to see the True Ending again but then with the added bonus scene. Why do the developers have to hide it like that? 
- At least 2 playthrough needed to get all ""Bonding Events"", where you learn a bit more about the specific character. Unnecessary to lock it away in one playthrough.

Can't wait for the next entry (Hajimari no Kiseki) to be localized for Steam."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"A perfect ending for the entire cold steel series. If you have yet to play the previous 3 games, I would NOT recommend you to jump right into this, because you will miss TONNES of references, making your experience worse.

What I like about the game:
1. The momentum built-up from the previous game(s) were kept. You won't feel it is a different game, but rather a continuation of the ongoing conflict.
2. There will always be a reason for everything, including [spoiler]why Osborne is following Ishmelga's influence though he has such a strong will[/spoiler]
3. When heroes from previous series, both from Liberl and Crossbell ark joined forces with class VII for common goal, it means business.

What I don't really like about the game:
1. Quite monotonous, though it is not as bad as Trails of Cold Steel 3. You need to do tonnes of side quest. Not the end of the world, but still..
2. [spoiler]Keep fighting the same boss from the previous series, over and over again. Really?? Now I need to fight the steroid version of McBurn?[/spoiler]

The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"Honestly I feel like I shouldn't even write a review for this game because most people who will be looking at this have probably already played at least all the cold steel games and know what they are getting into. The only thing I will say is that this game is best experienced if you have played every game in the series, have read most of the in game novels, and have read/watched a lot of the materials that are not part of the game (ring of judgement, Cs2 drama cd, etc.) This game references like everything that is part of the series and as a die hard fan it was really great to see that falcom renumbers a lot of this stuff. Overall this game is very good and if you are a trails fan what are you waiting for. 

Also if you are planning on playing Hajimari when it comes out please read this games novel three and nines it is very good."

The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"☆ (This isn't so much a review as something akin to my own personal feelings toward the game)

Honestly I typically don't bother writing reviews when it comes to any game I complete however since this marks the ending of the saga and at the moment of writing this only having just finished the game moments ago, with my hype levels through the roof I genuinely couldn't resist typing one up anyway.

Now I won't try to sell this game to anyone reading because if you're here then the chances are you've already completed every entry up until this fourth one and have probably already bought the game, waiting for it to install whilst browsing over other peoples comments and thoughts.

Let me just say that this series is a masterpiece whilst sure it definitely has a couple of shortcomings for example the rather obnoxious harem aspect which by my opinion wasn't as terrible as other people make it out to be however, I cannot deny the story would be a little better if let's say there was an actual singular love interest because that would at least leave some girls for the other characters to pair up with rather than having Rean horde them all for himself.

In conclusion before I ramble on any further I have played every game up to this point including Zero and Azure meaning without a doubt I'll be following this series for years to come, (Although hopefully Hajimari comes quicker than what I'm unfortunately expecting) and I may even replay some including the recently released GeoFront Azure translation.

Anyway thanks for reading my rambling thoughts and I hope everyone is as excited for Hajimari and Kuro as much as  I obviously am, last but absolutely not least; Sara is best girl & Laura is an insanely close second."
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"I just finished this game a few minutes ago and here my thoughts.

For the conclusion of the Cold Steel games this was extremely enjoyable to play through. After putting in 105 hours in this one, this has to be the longest Trails game that I have put hours in. 

I am wondering if Falcom will make another chapter of the Legend of Heroes series but I hope they do. 

"
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"The culmination of the epic series, it is definitely a fitting ending.  Tons of content and cameos throughout as well as great nods back to previous games.  Makes you wish they would bring the Crossbell arc over in English so you can appreciate the tie ins with that series.  Well worth your time to pick up and play if you love the series.  I look forward to the next game in this universe.

Spoilers follow: 
[spoiler]My major issue with the game is a few of the plot points that were either missed or felt forced.  The major one being Claire and Lechter.  In Cold Steel II and III Claire was elevated to near main character status and was definitely a love interest.  This is all lost in IV sadly as her entire plot line is basically forgotten about only given a bit of lip service.  I felt that all the other major NPC's got substantial time but Claire got left out as it seemed like they didn't know what to do with her.  It would have been nice to have her join the Radiant Wings and be a more important factor as I think it would have been logical to her arc.  Lechter as well this could have worked for but for Claire it was a big missed moment after a lot of the work they did building her up in the previous games.

The second ending as well could have been worked in more naturally.  Once you got into it it was great and I get why it was done this way.  However the entire thing felt very forced.  That said the ending fight was a blast, especially having all the characters available.

Finally I thought the romance options suffered in this game and were not as organic and deep as previous games.  A lot to wrap up I know but several girls it felt like you were starting back from square one or the moments weren't that romantic at all.[/spoiler]"
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV,RPG,1198090,"The 4th and final game Cold Steel Saga within the Trails series. 9 games worth of build up for many (but not all) plot points of the series culminates in this masterpiece of a game. My favorite RPG series of all time having played RPGs since the 90s. If you have already played the Trails in the Sky arc and the Trails from Zero arc, and you have played the other Trails of Cold Steel games, then this game should be an automatic no-thought-given purchase and very worth it at that. The game play and music are great too. The game excels in all areas except graphics but lower quality graphics compared to modern standards never bothered me to begin with."

Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"If you looking for something Horror like, but difficult by default then this is your game, I personally beat it once vanilla but prefer some mods that change the game up and ease off the intentionally hard RNG, (it is really rigged for you to get the lower end of the deal).

It is a great game, I feel like the rigged bad chances as well as the intentional limited inventory are done to slow you down Unnecessarily and create stress that really is not needed for the horror game.  I understand what they intended with it, but not my cup of tea, as you can have alot of grinding (if not on limited time mode) to fix bad rng moments. So with mods, I have seriously enjoyed the game, and recommended it even more so if you do use mods. I dont use overpowered mods, i only use those that double inventory space, and change up a few balance issues. You could use more powerful if you want, but I limited them to fixing or adding to the game, several class mods really enhance the game.

In the end, with mods, this game is amazing, without mods, its a mini dark souls that could use some adjustments but overall still good."
Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,Good and enjoyable game. Recommend to anyone
Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"A very good roguelike dungeon crawler game. Graphics are cool, and runs without bugs.

The mechanics of roguelike is very well implemented, strongly based on probabilities calculations developed to be balanced but against player, so he must compesate this disadvantage with luck, intelligence and perseverance. The remarkable depiction of foes, enviroments and lore contributes largely to the success of the whole.

Gameplay is a defiant, fun and well rewarded effort by its great amount of random and customizable things, there are many combinations of characters, skills and items to choose and foes and bosses to beat, all shown with a quality visual ambientation for a terror story, without forget fair maths that liyng behind.

This game demands high tolerance for frustration. Player is warned, by a notice before every starting, that he surely will loss characters permanently. Warning: this will happen surely, and many times, is really true. Heroes are free for recruit, but few arrives to town at once and player must to wait to class that he wants, and then train and equipt him, so he must to spend resources inmediatly to fix that.

Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"Darkest Dungeon is very interesting in many ways and yes, the difficulty is one of them. Let us leave this idea for last. 
Darkest Dungeon is a turn-based RPG that puts us in a scary, perverse, and very, very punitive scenario. The first great demonstration of the unique quality of the game is its excellent aesthetic, it is visually unique, extremely well done, creative, captivating, scary, everything there talks very well with the story, the narrative, the mechanics, and the proposal of the game. The story revolves around recovering your family's legacy by defeating the scariest monsters and bandits that have dominated the family properties, you must do this by recruiting heroes to explore the dungeons. In addition to the classic RPG mechanics, such as attacks, life heal, poison, bleed, stun, etc., etc. there is the most interesting addition: the stress mechanics. In addition to the classic RPG mechanics, such as attacks, life heal, poison, bleed, stun, etc., etc. there is the most interesting addition: the stress mechanics. Each hero has a bar that goes from 0 to 200, when it reaches 100 the determination of the hero is tested and can receive positive or negative bonuses that change his skills and behavior during the exploration until he is cured of the stress in the city when he arrives in 200 the hero has a heart attack and dies, and as you will quickly realize that the deaths are definitive (and we have no load game). 
Unique aesthetics, good mechanics, and one above the average of interesting, good gameplay driving, a concise story, an immersive soundtrack, and no problem with controls... After all, is there anything bad? The difficulty perhaps? Maybe, let's go to it (spoiler alert below).
It doesn't take long to notice how punitive Darkest Dungeon is, you lose a lot of life on each hit, you almost not damage your enemies, you evolve, achieving success here and there, but the enemies also improve, get more numerous, increase even more your stress... There are moments when you think ""Ok, this is impossible, I am not able"" all this having to manage your money and relics, the diseases and quirks that are accumulating and making everything even more difficult. It doesn't take long to notice how punitive Darkest Dungeon is, you lose a lot of life on each hit, you almost do no damage to enemies, you evolve, achieving success here and there, but the enemies also improve, get more numerous, increase each again your stress, there are moments when you think ""Ok, this is impossible, I am not able"" all this having to manage your money and relics, the diseases and quirks that are accumulating and making everything even more difficult. A lot of people may think that it is disproportionate (and maybe even it is) or that the difficulty is too high to cause controversy and be talked about, I reject this idea, if you want to make a game that is just difficult, you don't need to put quality in others aspects of the game, and Darkest Dungeon is extremely qualified in everything and, for me, when the game ends, the difficulty not only gains more meaning, but it also has a narrative sense.
When you finish the game, the narrator says ""victory, a hollow and ridiculous notion"" talks about the creature we faced at the end of the game, and declare""... and what sleeps is roused once more, to hatch from this fragile shell of earth and rock and bring our inescapable end. "" Here we have a notion that we have not definitively won, we have only won one round ... because destruction, the end, death, will take us back, inevitably no matter how hard we try, how much we try. And this is where the very high difficulty and the narrative converge, you evolve a little, you try, you put all your effort, but the evil you face in the next room is even stronger, even greater, more destructive, and your efforts are finite, enough a point that there is no way to improve and then the inescapable final comes. Our heroes die permanently, but they always arrive new, renewing hope until they reach their limit, cyclical until the evil finally wins, it is the inescapable ending. At a certain point, there is no way to improve more, and then the inescapable end comes.

Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"Darkest Dungeon has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. If I had to list my favorite things that make this game stand out it would have to be the incredible art style and aesthetic of the game, the high risk/high reward gameplay, and the amazing relationship the dev team has with the modding community.

Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"Darkest Dungeon is, at its core, a pain generator.  You win in this game by losing as slowly as possible.  If permanently losing a character you've spent hours leveling up because of a random crit would really upset you, this is not the game for you.  However, if you're not afraid of failure and are willing to push past the initial (and painful) learning curve, Darkest Dungeon has plenty of wonderful art and incredible encounters prepared for you.

Darkest Dungeon®,RPG,262060,"If you looking for something Horror like, but difficult by default then this is your game, I personally beat it once vanilla but prefer some mods that change the game up and ease off the intentionally hard RNG, (it is really rigged for you to get the lower end of the deal).

It is a great game, I feel like the rigged bad chances as well as the intentional limited inventory are done to slow you down Unnecessarily and create stress that really is not needed for the horror game.  I understand what they intended with it, but not my cup of tea, as you can have alot of grinding (if not on limited time mode) to fix bad rng moments. So with mods, I have seriously enjoyed the game, and recommended it even more so if you do use mods. I dont use overpowered mods, i only use those that double inventory space, and change up a few balance issues. You could use more powerful if you want, but I limited them to fixing or adding to the game, several class mods really enhance the game.

In the end, with mods, this game is amazing, without mods, its a mini dark souls that could use some adjustments but overall still good."

The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,"What the Witcher 1 lacks in graphics, gameplay and sheer playability, it more than makes up for by the amazing plot it carries. 

A few mods make the gameplay more bearable like enhanced combat, speed up geralt's speed, win every round of dice (personal favourite)

This game has a lot of stuff you'd expect in a Witcher game-
Witcher-hating villagers? Check.
Scoiatael that look like they have squirrel faeces on their face? Check.
Hookers that look more like Triss than Triss herself? Check.
Double-faced knights? Check.
Thaler's endless swearing? Check.

Add gwent and it might just surpass TW3."
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,"Only recommend it for the story.
Combat is a headache and there is a lot of running around. Would recommend mods to make Geralt run faster (2x speed)"
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,RPG,20900,"Great start to The Witcher saga. You start to play game and disconnect from real life. After 5-10 hours you are in the Witcher's world. 

Witcher's world and story not like the others. Not a fairytale or heroic adventures. This world is full of wars between kingdoms, betrayals, lies and more...

Story is great. As you progress through the story you wonder what will happen next. Really, your choices can change the story. Characters are good too. Geralt is one of my favorite game characters.

But the most important thing sucks. Combat System. I played nearly 35 hours and still can't understand how does it work. A remake could be great for who wants to play in 2021.

With proper investment it makes the game a joke. Unless you absolutely NEED to see how Witcher began, I'd probably just check out a recap video on YouTube.

Very much a spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night/Rondo of Blood/Aria of Sorrow/Harmony of Dissonance. They've made major improvements on the 2-D series, not only to 2.5D graphics but the detail of the characters and the art is wonderful."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"A great game, but it does have it's flaws.

Gameplay is pretty solid and addictive. Making builds using the shards you find and seeing your stats go up from leveling up and finding items is pretty fun. The art direction is good, but the graphics themselves are meh - I think it would've helped to display character portraits during cutscenes instead of looking at the character models up close. 

As for the bad, starting from halfway through the game (unless you go for the bad ending). the way to progress can get a little too cryptic at times. And when you find the solution, it isn't an ""a-ha!"" feeling; it's more like ""how the hell was I supposed to figure that out,"". Miriam controls fine, but can't attack up or straight down, and moves a bit on the slower side (I find myself sliding around cause of this). Bosses attacks can be tricky to dodge because of this, and their hitboxes can be hard to make out. Miriam also has little iframes - leading to you getting combo'd by enemies and bosses (I understand they didn't want you to use them to cheese the game, but maybe some compromise could've been made). And lastly, the hub and dying take up way too much of your time. I find myself running back and fourth between the shop and alchemy area getting the resources I need, and it gets tedious. Same with the quests; they say the same lines every time, and you have to accept their quests for the progress to actually count or to let you know if you have what you need. Upon dying, the game flashes a game over screen before reloading your last save. Considering the game can restore enemies in a room on a whim, surely it can do the same for the player. Could save you some time especially if you find yourself dying a lot.

Despite all these issues I've had, I still recommend the game. I've heard they are working on a sequel so hopefully they take some of these issues into account. Oh, and I find that the game doesn't like Xbox 360 controllers - makes it stutter and lag. Use any other gamepad."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"Man Iga and his team really delivered on this game! 

I heard of castlevania games before but I never played them. I am more of a casual gamer too but I had fun with this game. I say it is a 20 hr game for the main story. I have 40 hrs cuz of another playthru. I also did not notice any technical issues in my playthrus. Now time to explain why I enjoy this game and my thoughts.

The gameplay is so addicting. Fighting bosses is really fun. when you get fked by them intially it feels grueling but then gratifying once you finally figure out how YOU beat it. I also love the weapon choice and shards aspect in the game. For me most weapons felt pretty on par with each other and was more about what playstyle suits you best. Though the boots felt kinda lackluster imo. There is much variety when it comes to shard builds to facilitate many playstyles. I really love the grinding to find materials and shards to make ur builds even better. Then seeing it all come together is so satisfying. When you start. I would suggest to try as many different shards to get a feel of what you like. That was something I regret not doing early on. Trying out different builds really adds to the game's already existing extreme replayability value. Different modes and another playable character(I believe they're adding more later).

The story was not breathtaking for me. However, it was enough to motivate me to explore the world to find out more. There are lore bits delivered thru journal logs for those curious about the game's world. Personally, I didn't feel like reading while playing. I rather just smack something :P. However, I prob would look into it now since I just finished it.

The art direction was superb imo. There was many moments where I would stop moving just to look at the environment. Or even die to enemies(mainly bosses) because I was too busy looking at their design. I took many screenshots especially when I got to sit in chairs in different locations. 

Man the music gets me bopping. Boss fight starts. *Music plays* stands still to focus on music and takes damage. But hey that soundtrack tho! My favorite has to be Gears of Fortune! I love it so much!! Bro like I'm listening to it looped as I'm writing this review.

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,I just beat SOTN
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"I can probably count the number of game developers who came back from a decade-long hiatus on the fingers of one hand, let alone as much success and popularity as Koji Igarashi had garnered at the height of his career as a game developer. In an industry that's full of washed-up has-beens and frauds masquerading as creators - all of whom seem a tad too busy riding the coattails of their past glory to produce anything even mildly entertaining or creative, It's refreshing to see one creator that not only didn't succumb to the ravages of time, but rather silently honed his spirit and resolve, ultimately producing one of the finest games the genre has to offer.

Perhaps somewhat contrary to what has been said before, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night doesn't reinvent the wheel by any means. Nearly every mechanic in this game has been done before in previous titles that Koji had worked on, such as gravity flipping or soul collecting, except here it has been polished to a mirror shine. In essence, the same things that apply to previous games in the genre apply here too: The levels are large and sprawling and require a great deal of backtracking if one wishes to find all the extra bosses, loot, easter eggs, and general lore the game has to offer. The platforming is as good as it has ever been and the combat and boss encounters seem to be unique and memorable, as well as the myriad of colorful characters the game throws at you every now and then. The story isn't exactly revolutionary, but it gets the job done reasonably well. The Kickstarter promises that the developers said will come eventually are taking their sweet time to get here, but the ones that are already delivered seem to be well implemented and add a ton of replay value to what is already an impressively long game on its own.

In summary, there is no shortage of content here for pretty much any person of any skill level who happens to like action-platformers. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is what happens when egos aren't running out of control and there is enough freedom and willingness to listen to what fans of the genre had been wanting all along - an extremely rare event in today's industry even among crowdfunded projects."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"Really fun and enjoyable experience I really am glad I bought this, the concept of collecting shards is very fun, its a fun homage to the original Castlevania games giving the fact the Original creator helped create this masterpiece. If you love Castlevania games you will definitely find this entertaining. Don't pass it up during the sale. You won't regret diving into this adventure. The animation and detail and voice acting in this game is amazing along with the banging soundtrack,."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"I haven't enjoyed my time with Ritual of the Night at all. It doesn't come anywhere near the great Igavanias from the past that it's attempting to channel. And it's not the lore or the new settings fault. It's the way it plays and feels that's lackluster. I haven't completed the game because it's such a slog, though I do hope to do so one day and hopefully come back to this review with something more positive to say. Despite all this, I can't give it a thumbs down. It's clearly a labor of love and an attempt at reclaiming a spot in the genre despite not having the Castlevania license. But being indie is no excuse for how poor the game feels - just look at the fantastic Hollow Knight. It was made by 3 people.

What's absolutely baffling, is that the 8-bit Curse of the Moon and its sequel are phenomenal games that catch that old school feeling perfectly, and even transcend it at times. I'd say skip this and play those games instead."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"Its all of Iga's greatness packed into another awesome game. If you enjoy the igavania castlevania games or the metroidvania 
genre in general you should definitely pick this up be it on sale or at full price, its more of the castlevania goodness that we all love."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"I found this game to be pretty generic overall. The game is filled with muddy textures and bland monster designs. The boss fights lack any real depth or strategy, dodging for the most part is not necessary. The difficulty level is really low, great if you're looking for an easy game to pass the time with.

The best parts are the soundtrack and weapon / shard variety.

If you have played through many of the other metroidvania's on Steam this might be worth considering. Otherwise check out Hollow Knight or Ori first for a more engaging experience.

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,hard to put to words how nice/refreshing it is to play a game that's just pure and simple fun the whole way through and isn't full of time-wasting b.s. an absolute joy to play :)
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,I wanted something like the old Castelvania titles such as Dawn of Sorrow. Bloodstained: RotN is a fantastic modern reincarnation of those games. Easily becoming one of my favorite metdoidvanias.
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"A very good Metroidvania. Easy pick: if you like Castlevania, Malice Mizer and Harajuku gothic lolitas, this game is for you (even if not ALL of these!). Definitely not a GREAT Metroidvania, but a very pleasant one. It starts very lightly (and too easily), but picks up eventually, even had to level up 5 ranks at the end to beat the game more surely. The map is quite big and the music is oldschool/90s. Sadly enemies are a bit too repetitive and the plot/story is really mediocre, with obvious plot twists... The overall style is weird and uselessly very modern-Japanese (uni and manju mixed with Gackt, pet dogs/cats, princess coach and Baby Metal...) but for the price, and for 20 hours, a good, though easily forgettable Castlevania tribute!

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"I bought the game for three things: the amazing graphics, Iga kicking it in the trailers and mostly because I didn't get a chance to play CSOTN. I owned it on PS but dismissed it because it felt like a step back when I ran the game for the first time (it was an old school game even back then!), I was wrong and it were my college roommates who unlocked the potential of it, they discovered the street fighter like techniques, how familiars became little floating killer machines and they were wowed when the castle turned upside down while I wowed as well in the back row (there were the occasional rumbles when someone used or saved over someone else's file). 
So I came with those expectations tothis game. I have to say I was a little dissapointed, I had just got The Vagrant, another metroidvania here on Steam, and loved the animations and combos, and just like with CSOTN i felt like a stepback, this supposedly great game couldn't even get this simple animations with simple attacks, but this time I kept playing, and then my RPG TOC kicked in, I got double jump, broke a wall, got better armor, built weapons in the shop, found an underwater stage I couldn't access early on, but I was sure I would get the item if I kept looking... In sum: I loved it. Be mindful though! there are things that could be deal breakers if you're not used to ultra cryptic conditions for game progress like in really really old school games, I honestly could see myself rage quitting this game had internet not existed, and I'm not talking about sidequests, but the main game: how about needing a library ID, which you have to get from a tertiary character who is completely unrelated to the plot, in order to get aboard a train. Really if you're stuck check yt. ps. I was kind of dissapointed that familiars never became little floating killer machines in this game."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,best game
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"An overall solid metroidvania game. I will admit that I did get lost multiple times throughout the playthrough, but it's thankfully not too difficult to figure out. An overall solid title!"
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets.
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"This game is so Castlevania that it couldn't Castlevania any harder even if its name was Belmont. Very much a spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night/Rondo of Blood/Aria of Sorrow/Harmony of Dissonance. They've made major improvements on the 2-D series, not only to 2.5D graphics but the detail of the characters and the art is wonderful."
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,RPG,692850,"A great game, but it does have it's flaws.

Gameplay is pretty solid and addictive. Making builds using the shards you find and seeing your stats go up from leveling up and finding items is pretty fun. The art direction is good, but the graphics themselves are meh - I think it would've helped to display character portraits during cutscenes instead of looking at the character models up close. 

As for the bad, starting from halfway through the game (unless you go for the bad ending). the way to progress can get a little too cryptic at times. And when you find the solution, it isn't an ""a-ha!"" feeling; it's more like ""how the hell was I supposed to figure that out,"". Miriam controls fine, but can't attack up or straight down, and moves a bit on the slower side (I find myself sliding around cause of this). Bosses attacks can be tricky to dodge because of this, and their hitboxes can be hard to make out. Miriam also has little iframes - leading to you getting combo'd by enemies and bosses (I understand they didn't want you to use them to cheese the game, but maybe some compromise could've been made). And lastly, the hub and dying take up way too much of your time. I find myself running back and fourth between the shop and alchemy area getting the resources I need, and it gets tedious. Same with the quests; they say the same lines every time, and you have to accept their quests for the progress to actually count or to let you know if you have what you need. Upon dying, the game flashes a game over screen before reloading your last save. Considering the game can restore enemies in a room on a whim, surely it can do the same for the player. Could save you some time especially if you find yourself dying a lot.

Despite all these issues I've had, I still recommend the game. I've heard they are working on a sequel so hopefully they take some of these issues into account. Oh, and I find that the game doesn't like Xbox 360 controllers - makes it stutter and lag. Use any other gamepad."

Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"[h1]Borderlands 3 is a good game, ruined by the greed of 2K and Pitchford.[/h1]
I want to preface this review with the fact that I really enjoyed Borderlands 3, FAR MORE than I did with any other Borderlands game. I adored the both the shooting and RPG elements of BL3, I think it's the best in the series. I get what I want in Borderlands the most in BL3, fun and insane guns. The close range explosive Flakker, the laser pistol Lightshow, the slot machine integrated gun Lucky 7, and the gun that shoots fucking burgers are all inventions of madmen and I love them. The playable characters are also the best in the series. Multiple action skills allow for you to have 4 BL2 characters in a single BL3 Vault Hunter. There's no real generic gun man (like Axton, Roland, and Wilhelm) and all of them can be played in unique methods. Endgame is also significantly better than BL2's, as Mayhem levels don't require an hour long investment and all of them are free to you in an instant. A final note that a lot of people are sleeping on, you only have to do a single playthrough per character to experience all the content in the game! Honestly dread starting new characters in Borderlands 2, because a max level character entails visiting Sawtooth Cauldron 3 times.

Now why is this review negative? Let's start off with the apparent reasons that are actually in the game. The UI is nauseating, the mini-maps are an actual challenge to navigate due to how they factor in different floor levels and it constantly rotating. The same mini-map will look drastically different from itself if you just move up a staircase and face the other way. Also, it is not my expertise to say why, but BL3 has terrible optimization and even the highest end pcs will experience stutters over very little. But the most offending factor of BL3 would be the game's writing. The main story has some of the worst writing I've seen in a AAA game. Ava is probably one of my least favorite characters from this decade. She is a literal child that constantly whines and learns nothing, but for some reason gets the keys to the Crimson Raiders thrown her way. And don't even get me started on the Calypso twins. Living up to Handsome Jack is a very difficult task, but they were miles away from ever achieving that. Tyreen's motivation are the generic ""I want power for the sake of it"" villain trope and Troy exists for a buildup to nothing. If you want a more detailed explanation on the faults of BL3's story, I highly recommend Cartoonshi's video on the topic.

What I care most about however is the numerous shoddy business practices of 2K and Randy Pitchford. BL3 is a $60 game with another $80 worth of DLC in its 2 season passes. The $115 asking price for all the game's content is baffling to me and I cannot justify that cost for any video game. Not to mention the fact that a second season pass betrays the promise that season pass holders get all future DLC content. Oh and there was also the Epic Games Exclusive deal. A complete lack of care for their consumers by locking the game behind an inferior storefront. The money from said deal didn't even go to the developers, but rather the greedy executives as Gearbox devs never received their promised bonuses after the game sold 5 million copies. This combined with the allegations of assault and severe underpay from the former Claptrap voice actor really lead me to believe that Gearbox is a talented studio held back by their money-grubbing publishers. I genuinely hope Gearbox will someday be able to stand without 2K someday.

As a TLDR: I love BL3, it's a very fun game with some flaws in UI, optimization, and writing. But I find the toxic work environment of 2K, underpaying of employees, and the anti-consumer business practices make it very hard for me to recommend anyone to get it. 2K is a company up there with EA with their abuse and greed and I hope that less people support them."
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"How to play Borderlands 3:

1. Mod the game to remove all dialogue
2. Skip all cutscenes
3. Now you are able to enjoy the game."
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"If I had a dollar for every time I laughed at a joke, I would have exactly zero dollar."
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"Look, man, I beat the fuck out of this game.

I'll keep it short and sweet, nothing is going to live up to Borderlands 2, so Borderlands 3 is alright with that in mind. About as good as the Pre-Sequel is on reflection. The original four DLCs are fun, at least, but only the Fantastic Fustercluck and Love, Guns, & Tentacles stand out.

If you can find it cheap or on sale, grab it. Don't worry about the stuff that came with the ""Second Season Pass"", it's trash."
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"I know I'm just repeating what every other reviewer has said about this game, but I mean it when I say that the game is incredibly fun to play, but the main story and writing is absolutely awful. If you play Borderlands for the gameplay, Borderlands 3 is a great investment. It's very polished and very very fun to play once you get the hang of it. If you've played the other entries in the series and don't mind seeing your favorite characters steamrolled into cardboard shells of their former selves, then by all means buy the game. But only when it's on sale. It is absolutely not worth the full price.

Some executive decisions were made during the process of creating this game that sucked the signature writing style right out of it. If you got attached to the characters in Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel, then you will be sorely disappointed by this game. Lilith is an emotionless punching bag whose lost all of her fire, and Ava is the immature screaming child wailing on that punching bag. Maya brought some light and fun back into the game, only to be literally turned into ash because of the aforementioned immature screaming child. They hyped up Tina before this game released, but she's only in it for one mission. Tyreen and Troy could've been great villains if they'd actually followed through on the buildup they were laying for them to start fighting with each other. But instead they foreshadowed... nothing?

It really feels like there was a writer's room who had a bunch of incredible ideas, then someone with more power over the project came in and butchered the absolute hell out of those ideas.

Also Randy Pitchford sucks absolute giant dog dick and has massive sloppy diarrhea shits and I hate him."
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"I tried to like this game, but they've taken the wrong approach to many decisions about the game. It doesn't scratch the same itches as Borderlands 1 or 2. Loot is over-abundant and there is a significant lack of gear with any sort of personality. End game doesn't feel anywhere near as replayable as previous titles and I feel incredibly discouraged to start any new playthroughs due to how mind-numbingly slow the main story is to play through.

I was looking forward to the free content seasons and while they were interesting at first I'm now disappointment that they're taking the Overwatch approach and just re-hashing the same event every year and locking some of the only noteworthy gear behind a short timeframe in an attempt to encourage people to play, but it's only further turned me off from doing so.

Also, while I'm inherently not against a second season pass of content, I feel the way it was approached was very scummy and has only made me look down on the game even more. You pay full price and get half the playable content, some of which was shown to be completed and ready to ship since before the game's release but was since cut and put behind this paywall which, again, is full price and never goes on sale.

On a more positive note the improvements to movement mechanics definitely enhance gunfights and make the game feel more fluid than previous entries. On top of that I enjoyed the increased vehicle customisation, new side content concepts (clappy parts, hammerlock hunts, zero missions, typhon logs etc). The quality of life features introduced are definitely a blessing, auto buying full ammo, auto currency pickup, fast travel and respawn overhauls as well as the new weapon features (alt firing modes, new manufacturer traits + the reintroduction of ATLAS). Photo mode also gets a special shoutout as a feature I never knew I needed but now I want every game to have.

Finally, I need to address how much I love some of the new characters (not Ava). While the story overall may have been weak, the likes of Wainwright Jakobs, Pain and Terror, Chadd, Rhys and Typhon Deleon all gave the game some definite spice in their appearances. Returning characters were cool to see as well, though I wish they put more focus into fan favourites such as the B-Team instead of characters like Lillith.

Overall, BL3 demonstrates a greater misunderstanding from the Devs of what long term fans want from the franchise. While some welcome changes were made, many felt as if they were trying to re-make the foundations into something which was ultimately worse, instead of building on top of what were already proven to be a tried and true basis. At the end of the day it's still a Borderlands title and if you're a returning fan you're sure to find at least some enjoyment on a first time playthrough, but will likely not feel the need to come back for more any time soon."
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"Quick Review:
If your liked BL2 and the Pre-Sequels story, I highly doubt you are going to like this story.
The gunplay in this game is the best so far in the series.
The overall enjoyment of the game is pretty meh, you have to make your own fun.
The levelling up system is okay.
Get this game is its on sale but not for anything else"
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"This game is amazing but gearbox makes it look like a ball of wet dogshit on a stick.
First off is the greed of this company that's absolutely disgusting. 2 season passes? Never heard of a game that has 2 season passes. This is just open robbery.
The next thing is the performance. This game is a fucking mess performance wise. It's a horrendous slide show, lag spikes everywhere, it crashes every 10 minutes, It's just awful.
The Gameplay on the other hand is amazing; in fact it's the best quality of this game. It's what makes me put up with the crashes and the lag spikes.
Soundtracks are ok.
Everyone says the story is awful, I don't think so. It might be a bit worse than the previous games but it's whatever, the gameplay is so good that I don't really care about it.
The game looks beautiful. The colors are glamorous, the guns look good, the new gameplay mechanics are great. BUT unfortunately I cannot recommend a game made by such a greedy company that doesn't care about the community and only cares about their bank account.
NO from me"
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,Not as good as borderlands 2. Horrible main villain.
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"This is a negative review but only just , i'd have been happier buying it on special.

Great guns as usual, some great design work has gone into the look and ability of guns. lots of variation, my most liked thing about all borderlands games.
Graphics are great , also some nice design and artwork.
game plays well, like the others.

Cons:
The story , pretty flimsy really , not much effort here.

2 season passes you say ? no thanks. ill keep my money. besides i have played enough already. 

it's exactly like the last 2 games , i was hoping for something a little different in any way. nope. towards the end  i just felt like i was grinding.

Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"Borderlands 3 is one of the hardest games for me to review. Did I log a ton of time into the game and get a lot of achievements? Yes, but that is because I am weird like that. Did I really and truly enjoy my time in the game? I am honestly not sure. I really wish there was a lukewarm option for recommending/not recommending a game. 

I can say after replaying all the Borderlands games on Steam this past year that 3 is definitely my least favorite. I don't feel like the humor was there, some of the voice actor changes didn't work that well, I thought the UI/backpack management was a huge step down from previous entries, and the story just wasn't entertaining. I didn't find myself having fun and laughing at dialogue but I also found myself looking at the clock every time I played and could never really binge the game in one sitting. When I compare those feelings to every other entry it is definitely the reason I do not recommend this game and why I hope Gearbox revisits the Borderlands series in a different way.

It is worth mentioning that I did enjoy the classes, talent trees, and the actually gun-play from the game and I do think improvements were made there. But when I weigh that against how much I loved every other entry in the series I can't help but feel let down. I will continue to be a Borderlands fan but Gearbox has some work to do."

Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"[h1]Borderlands 3 is a good game, ruined by the greed of 2K and Pitchford.[/h1]
I want to preface this review with the fact that I really enjoyed Borderlands 3, FAR MORE than I did with any other Borderlands game. I adored the both the shooting and RPG elements of BL3, I think it's the best in the series. I get what I want in Borderlands the most in BL3, fun and insane guns. The close range explosive Flakker, the laser pistol Lightshow, the slot machine integrated gun Lucky 7, and the gun that shoots fucking burgers are all inventions of madmen and I love them. The playable characters are also the best in the series. Multiple action skills allow for you to have 4 BL2 characters in a single BL3 Vault Hunter. There's no real generic gun man (like Axton, Roland, and Wilhelm) and all of them can be played in unique methods. Endgame is also significantly better than BL2's, as Mayhem levels don't require an hour long investment and all of them are free to you in an instant. A final note that a lot of people are sleeping on, you only have to do a single playthrough per character to experience all the content in the game! Honestly dread starting new characters in Borderlands 2, because a max level character entails visiting Sawtooth Cauldron 3 times.

Now why is this review negative? Let's start off with the apparent reasons that are actually in the game. The UI is nauseating, the mini-maps are an actual challenge to navigate due to how they factor in different floor levels and it constantly rotating. The same mini-map will look drastically different from itself if you just move up a staircase and face the other way. Also, it is not my expertise to say why, but BL3 has terrible optimization and even the highest end pcs will experience stutters over very little. But the most offending factor of BL3 would be the game's writing. The main story has some of the worst writing I've seen in a AAA game. Ava is probably one of my least favorite characters from this decade. She is a literal child that constantly whines and learns nothing, but for some reason gets the keys to the Crimson Raiders thrown her way. And don't even get me started on the Calypso twins. Living up to Handsome Jack is a very difficult task, but they were miles away from ever achieving that. Tyreen's motivation are the generic ""I want power for the sake of it"" villain trope and Troy exists for a buildup to nothing. If you want a more detailed explanation on the faults of BL3's story, I highly recommend Cartoonshi's video on the topic.

What I care most about however is the numerous shoddy business practices of 2K and Randy Pitchford. BL3 is a $60 game with another $80 worth of DLC in its 2 season passes. The $115 asking price for all the game's content is baffling to me and I cannot justify that cost for any video game. Not to mention the fact that a second season pass betrays the promise that season pass holders get all future DLC content. Oh and there was also the Epic Games Exclusive deal. A complete lack of care for their consumers by locking the game behind an inferior storefront. The money from said deal didn't even go to the developers, but rather the greedy executives as Gearbox devs never received their promised bonuses after the game sold 5 million copies. This combined with the allegations of assault and severe underpay from the former Claptrap voice actor really lead me to believe that Gearbox is a talented studio held back by their money-grubbing publishers. I genuinely hope Gearbox will someday be able to stand without 2K someday.

As a TLDR: I love BL3, it's a very fun game with some flaws in UI, optimization, and writing. But I find the toxic work environment of 2K, underpaying of employees, and the anti-consumer business practices make it very hard for me to recommend anyone to get it. 2K is a company up there with EA with their abuse and greed and I hope that less people support them."
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"How to play Borderlands 3:

1. Mod the game to remove all dialogue
2. Skip all cutscenes
3. Now you are able to enjoy the game."
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"If I had a dollar for every time I laughed at a joke, I would have exactly zero dollar."
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"Look, man, I beat the fuck out of this game.

I'll keep it short and sweet, nothing is going to live up to Borderlands 2, so Borderlands 3 is alright with that in mind. About as good as the Pre-Sequel is on reflection. The original four DLCs are fun, at least, but only the Fantastic Fustercluck and Love, Guns, & Tentacles stand out.

If you can find it cheap or on sale, grab it. Don't worry about the stuff that came with the ""Second Season Pass"", it's trash."
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"I know I'm just repeating what every other reviewer has said about this game, but I mean it when I say that the game is incredibly fun to play, but the main story and writing is absolutely awful. If you play Borderlands for the gameplay, Borderlands 3 is a great investment. It's very polished and very very fun to play once you get the hang of it. If you've played the other entries in the series and don't mind seeing your favorite characters steamrolled into cardboard shells of their former selves, then by all means buy the game. But only when it's on sale. It is absolutely not worth the full price.

Some executive decisions were made during the process of creating this game that sucked the signature writing style right out of it. If you got attached to the characters in Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel, then you will be sorely disappointed by this game. Lilith is an emotionless punching bag whose lost all of her fire, and Ava is the immature screaming child wailing on that punching bag. Maya brought some light and fun back into the game, only to be literally turned into ash because of the aforementioned immature screaming child. They hyped up Tina before this game released, but she's only in it for one mission. Tyreen and Troy could've been great villains if they'd actually followed through on the buildup they were laying for them to start fighting with each other. But instead they foreshadowed... nothing?

It really feels like there was a writer's room who had a bunch of incredible ideas, then someone with more power over the project came in and butchered the absolute hell out of those ideas.

Also Randy Pitchford sucks absolute giant dog dick and has massive sloppy diarrhea shits and I hate him."
Borderlands 3,RPG,397540,"I tried to like this game, but they've taken the wrong approach to many decisions about the game. It doesn't scratch the same itches as Borderlands 1 or 2. Loot is over-abundant and there is a significant lack of gear with any sort of personality. End game doesn't feel anywhere near as replayable as previous titles and I feel incredibly discouraged to start any new playthroughs due to how mind-numbingly slow the main story is to play through.

I was looking forward to the free content seasons and while they were interesting at first I'm now disappointment that they're taking the Overwatch approach and just re-hashing the same event every year and locking some of the only noteworthy gear behind a short timeframe in an attempt to encourage people to play, but it's only further turned me off from doing so.

Also, while I'm inherently not against a second season pass of content, I feel the way it was approached was very scummy and has only made me look down on the game even more. You pay full price and get half the playable content, some of which was shown to be completed and ready to ship since before the game's release but was since cut and put behind this paywall which, again, is full price and never goes on sale.

On a more positive note the improvements to movement mechanics definitely enhance gunfights and make the game feel more fluid than previous entries. On top of that I enjoyed the increased vehicle customisation, new side content concepts (clappy parts, hammerlock hunts, zero missions, typhon logs etc). The quality of life features introduced are definitely a blessing, auto buying full ammo, auto currency pickup, fast travel and respawn overhauls as well as the new weapon features (alt firing modes, new manufacturer traits + the reintroduction of ATLAS). Photo mode also gets a special shoutout as a feature I never knew I needed but now I want every game to have.

Finally, I need to address how much I love some of the new characters (not Ava). While the story overall may have been weak, the likes of Wainwright Jakobs, Pain and Terror, Chadd, Rhys and Typhon Deleon all gave the game some definite spice in their appearances. Returning characters were cool to see as well, though I wish they put more focus into fan favourites such as the B-Team instead of characters like Lillith.

Overall, BL3 demonstrates a greater misunderstanding from the Devs of what long term fans want from the franchise. While some welcome changes were made, many felt as if they were trying to re-make the foundations into something which was ultimately worse, instead of building on top of what were already proven to be a tried and true basis. At the end of the day it's still a Borderlands title and if you're a returning fan you're sure to find at least some enjoyment on a first time playthrough, but will likely not feel the need to come back for more any time soon."

Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"I'm about 20 hours into this game, so I wanted to drop a quick First Impression:

BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.   Based on my perspective, CK3 is a more of a hybrid wargame/management system.  Like many of the CIV games, you have opportunities to build and improve provinces... and you can certainly raise military forces (I think strictly land-based; naval seems to be abstracted or nonexistent so far).  

But the builder/wargame aspect is only 50% of the game experience, and I estimate that liberally.  All of these things are tightly wrapped up in a decision-based management system that produces causes and effects; with some of the effects being far-reaching.

EXAMPLE: your head of clergy doesn't like you, so he accuses you of having an incestuous relationship.  You decide to Deny it.  He gets even madder.  One of your courtiers hears a rumor that the clergyman is plotting to kill your daughter.  So you secretly arrange for him to be murdered.  The neighboring Lord finds out through spies that you're responsible, so he blackmails you.  Even though you pay him off, his cousin, the Lord in the OTHER neighboring county decides you're weak and decides to lay claim to YOUR title... armies march, wars get fought, etc....

YES, this gets THAT complicated.  And the levels of all of these interactions get very deep and very complicated, like a spider web.

So far, I'm loving it (although to be frank, the ""new"" hasn't quite worn off yet).  The biggest advice I can give anyone thinking about buying CK3 is what I said up front:  Make Sure You Know What You're buying.

If you buy it looking for only a wargame, you'll be disappointed.  If you buy it only looking for an empire builder (like CIV), you'll be disappointed.

Respectfully submitted as my humble opinion; take it or leave it."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"I raided the muslim controlled island of Crete. As I go to ransom my prisoners I notice a 1 year old girl has died in my dungeons, and as it just so happens she was infected with the bubonic plague.

I quickly mass execute all my muslim prisoners as damage control, but it's too late. The plague spreads like wildfire through my court, infecting me and many of my family. My court physician tries his best, but it's not enough. Eventually my character has given up the ghost, and with him goes the dream of a united north sea empire, all because of a tiny muslim girl from Crete.

10/10 would raid again"
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"Interesting dating simulator. For some reason there's a lot of minigames and side content and the dating isnt really indepth but like, you can play with friends and that's cool."

My kingdom proceeds to splinter and fall apart because my 10 year old player heir was incapable of reading and breathing at the same time.

10/10 will probably put 2-300 hours into this game."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"Interesting game at start, but once you get down to it you can just repeat same patterns to win. And regardless of game time, the constant events popping up become veeery repetitive and sometimes you can't even do anything about them. Late game becomes boring with how slowly a massive empire can do things, not to mention if someone rebels (Which they will.) you're powerless to stop them due to numbers and no allies if you cover over half the map. The fact that new content you need to buy to find new things in the game is even less inspiring, seeing the initial price + expansion packs prompts up the price quickly."

CK3 is still lacking many features that are part of CK2 and its dlcs. The number of events are far fewer and I would still say that CK2 offers the better gameplay experience. BUT CK3 is a great base to build upon. In the future, CK3 will probably become a much better game. And at the moment, QoL, UI, graphics and even balancing are much better than in CK2."

Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"Much more fleshed out than CK2. Just buy it already, your wont be disappointed."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"This is probably the best introduction game for someone considering getting into grand strategy games. I saw the potential fun factor when watching some Youtubers such as Valefisk doing some crazy stuff with CK II.

I bought this game at release with mixed feelings but soon after learning to play I found a INSANELY addictive and enjoyable game. This is pretty much the Sims series combined with the Civilization series of games in the best possible way.

I cant recommend this game enough, seriously its so much fun, even more so with some of mods out there.

I think my only real problems are some random bugs which is minor and my biggest complaint being that some character models have clipping issues on there models which hopefully can be fixed over time.

This game can only get better."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"I think Crusader Kings III is trying to sell the fantasy of ruling a powerful dynasty through middle-ages, and the potential for complex political situations and dramatic moments.
It somewhat fails in that regard, but ends up being a fun game anyways.

It’s fun to paint the whole Europe in your kingdom’s color.
It’s fun to kidnap your enemy’s wife to take her as a concubine, just to assert dominance.
It’s fun to breed your dynasty into albino giants.
And for once, paradox 4x doesn’t force you to bookmark the game’s wiki, every mechanic is clear and explained.

Mod support is incredible and if you get bored of the current map there’s a lot of very well made maps set in fantasy worlds or historical areas that the vanilla map doesn’t cover in depth or at all.

In that mindset the game is 4/5.


But the game kinda suffers similar problems as Skyrim does with it’s quest markers.
You don’t need to know what’s happening or who you’re helping. All you need to do is walk towards the quest marker and kill the bad guy.
Similarly, you don’t need to know what dynasties or personality traits your vassals or your only son has, you only need to know if the rebellion faction has a bigger army than you have.
After a few achievement runs your brain is going to be stuck in auto-pilot mode and it’s going to be hard to get it back into roleplaying mode, as every single complex situation boils down to a single number.

Another point is that even though the game has complex relations between characters and families underneath, those don’t really result in complex results.
If you anger the head of another powerful dynasty you’d think the result is going to be a notable power struggle or something else dramatic. In reality it’s either absolutely nothing, or failed murder plot against you.
When you give your son and heir some practice land to rule over, your vassals are just going to declare war on him, and send him back to your court 1 week later, with next to no notifications or possibility to intervene given to you.
Wars themselves don’t have any depth in them, especially after early-game you beat the enemy army by having more men in the 1st battle and then you siege their capital.

Because of this you never get any powerful or tense moments that are in my opinion crucial for this kind of potential to be realized.

When you’re stuck in the apathy of nothing in the game actually mattering, it goes down to 2/5.


Paradox games go on sale periodically and get continuously new content through dlcs and free updates, so if your expectations are appropriate and you’re interested definitely pick up the game on sale.

It’s a good game that can end up being a great one in the future.

Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,Think long and hard about how much you value your personal relationships and career before buying this game.

Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,good
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,Officially converted from Civilization games to this...wow this game is awesome in every aspect.
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"I'm about 20 hours into this game, so I wanted to drop a quick First Impression:

BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.   Based on my perspective, CK3 is a more of a hybrid wargame/management system.  Like many of the CIV games, you have opportunities to build and improve provinces... and you can certainly raise military forces (I think strictly land-based; naval seems to be abstracted or nonexistent so far).  

But the builder/wargame aspect is only 50% of the game experience, and I estimate that liberally.  All of these things are tightly wrapped up in a decision-based management system that produces causes and effects; with some of the effects being far-reaching.

EXAMPLE: your head of clergy doesn't like you, so he accuses you of having an incestuous relationship.  You decide to Deny it.  He gets even madder.  One of your courtiers hears a rumor that the clergyman is plotting to kill your daughter.  So you secretly arrange for him to be murdered.  The neighboring Lord finds out through spies that you're responsible, so he blackmails you.  Even though you pay him off, his cousin, the Lord in the OTHER neighboring county decides you're weak and decides to lay claim to YOUR title... armies march, wars get fought, etc....

YES, this gets THAT complicated.  And the levels of all of these interactions get very deep and very complicated, like a spider web.

So far, I'm loving it (although to be frank, the ""new"" hasn't quite worn off yet).  The biggest advice I can give anyone thinking about buying CK3 is what I said up front:  Make Sure You Know What You're buying.

If you buy it looking for only a wargame, you'll be disappointed.  If you buy it only looking for an empire builder (like CIV), you'll be disappointed.

Respectfully submitted as my humble opinion; take it or leave it."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"I raided the muslim controlled island of Crete. As I go to ransom my prisoners I notice a 1 year old girl has died in my dungeons, and as it just so happens she was infected with the bubonic plague.

I quickly mass execute all my muslim prisoners as damage control, but it's too late. The plague spreads like wildfire through my court, infecting me and many of my family. My court physician tries his best, but it's not enough. Eventually my character has given up the ghost, and with him goes the dream of a united north sea empire, all because of a tiny muslim girl from Crete.

10/10 would raid again"
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"Interesting dating simulator. For some reason there's a lot of minigames and side content and the dating isnt really indepth but like, you can play with friends and that's cool."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"It's uh, it's just a little bit addictive."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"Got the flu, doctor says he needed to do drastic measures to save me ""do what you have to do doc"", proceeds to cut my leg off. I die from sepsis a couple of weeks later because he used a rusty bread knife. My kingdom proceeds to splinter and fall apart because my 10 year old player heir was incapable of reading and breathing at the same time.

10/10 will probably put 2-300 hours into this game."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"I can make the most inbred family possible. If my character's family tree isn't a circle at the start of a game, it will be quickly."
Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"This review is aimed at people who played CK2:

CK3 is still lacking many features that are part of CK2 and its dlcs. The number of events are far fewer and I would still say that CK2 offers the better gameplay experience. BUT CK3 is a great base to build upon. In the future, CK3 will probably become a much better game. And at the moment, QoL, UI, graphics and even balancing are much better than in CK2."

Crusader Kings III,Strategy,1158310,"It's fun for the first 100-150 hours, then it gets repetitive. Should wait for more content via DLCs, Which i would say is not very pleasing specially after a longer period of time when you have already spent over 200-300$ on a single game for game mechanics that overtime have become very basic and fundamental."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,"This, along with the sequel is two of my top 10 games of all time.  Relatively unpopular opinion but I like this a little more than the sequel. These two games singlehandedly made me fall in love with turn based combat.

I adore the over-the-top humor, cartoonish atmosphere and graphics, extraordinary world building and detail. I wish I could erase my memory and replay this masterpiece all over again."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,"[b][i]Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition[/i][/b] is a party-RPG.
The character development system is classless, there are several skill trees and weapon types. The combat is turn-based.
Graphics and sound are adequate, the controls are rebindable, but can be unresponsive. 

The game is very co-op friendly.

There were few small bugs and lore-related inconsistencies with other games in the series."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,"as a rpg it is legit, even amazing... but its story is just... meh. just say it is not my type. characters are having adventures, that's cool. and adventures are pretty good. but they do not grow as the story proceed. they learn more about their past yea, but lack of depth. and i do not think there are curves.  as a game i admit it is pretty fun, even tho some puzzles are really hard. i just do not like its story, it is too typical. i would give it neuter if that is an option.
also there are not much hints about how you should do your mission, this can be a good thing, or bad, depends on how you see it. but you just need abit more patience to find out what's the next you should do. but it requires you to think more and be creative, and pay attention to everything you can read. i consider this a good feature. but also you can get frustrated coz you might mess up (for example kill some npc without realizing he or she is important in some quest) and that will cause some quests can not be finished as you expected."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,An absolute blast to play coop. Larian churning out gold.
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,"A fun, fairly unique (outside of DOS:II and the upcoming BG3) game which is well worth the price of admission."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,"I finished the game on my second attempt (hence the 160 hours - about 65 hours first attempt). I wanted to finish the game because it looked very nice, combat was good and there were some aspects that were fun. I failed for the first time because of the non-immersive story.

When I finally finished the game, I was disappointed. Nearing the end, it was very frustrating (I would stop playing it but I just wanted to finish it when I had invested 80 hours in it already and it was the second time). And the main story which had appeared very nice was very disappointing.

Cons:
- Very slow pace, non-immersive.
- Some bad and frustrating... let's call it puzzles. Lit a candle to open something (just a regular candle like many other candles everywhere)? Take a book and carry it for a long time to progress somewhere else when there are million of useless books lying everywhere? Find a switch in a big cavern to move some rocks? Really?
- It is nice that every dialog is narrated... but the NPCs around repeat it very often and forever! Try to manage your inventory when you hear the same sentence again, and again, and again... it's mad.
- Disappointing main story.

Pros:
- Very nice graphics.
- Combat is good (with a few exceptions).
- Narration (except the repetition).
- Some very nice mechanics like traits from decisions, pet pal, surfaces."
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,RPG,373420,"Nearly everything in this game is very good: The graphics, the character system, the fighting system, the choices. If you only need this, than this is propably a fun game for you.

However, it fails in the most important discipline of a roleplaying game: The story. The last third of the story arc is one of the worst I've ever had experienced in a roleplaying game. 

You were dissapointed with the original ending of Mass Effect 3 or the last episode of Lost? Don't play this game; the ending is so disappointing and you really have the feeling that the story was written in a rush towards the end. It is promising at first, however, in the end, you don't have the feeling that any of your choices mattered and it was going so completely crazy that every author should have this as an case book on how not to end a promising story."

American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"well i've both game in my library ETS and ATS though i like ATS more because it's just feels different , i just can't explain it well but surely this game magical elixir for people who are facing Anxiety/Depression during Pandemic it's really works like a drug and instant anxiety reliever. simulation features are perfect and gives you real life driving simulator experience ... no doubt why reviews are Overwhelmingly Positive.. it's awesome game to try with steering wheel... i am really enjoying it and looking forward to buying all remaining dlc if they decide to low down prices little bit in sale time.. overall must game for people who want to experience real truck driving.. buy without hesitation and support the developers."
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"Hi guys I want to go with different comment:
Its great and I enjoy this game its real simulation truck,but after a while it will repeated and a little boring,but I have many suggestions:
hey developers did u ever think about it to make a story for it?story is missing in this game,yeah I buy new truck new company ,upgrade it and so on...but really if there was a little talking with other guys in trucks or company's,u could talk with employees,or even polices and other driver,u could make a story like going into snows,get stock in snow,or engine burnt,or going to eat something,I think if the company get some option in to game that we could on it or off it by our opinion,like going WC,food need,chat with other guys and go online,joining event and going to teamwork,even making company with real people,joining,firing,and get it another way of playing to be more real,more fun,make journey,digging mine and get some gold or digging tunnel and make new roads,and many other idea i think about it,it certainly will be game of the year ,I believe it,u are overwhelming just now,think about what I say,a strong story,and online player,teams,company ,events and if u want to hear more of my idea just tell me,"
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"Although the sensation of driving a bit similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2, this game has a thick American landscape and atmosphere, which is very suitable for those who are seeking for a realistic simulation games."

If you want, you can travel through America with your friends. Imo this is the best part of the game. And ATS MP community isn't toxic like ETS2 MP.

But game isn't great. Most of the map is desert and looks same. The map is too small in the standard version (without DLC's) of the game. And you need to pay money to more.

American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"I can't drive in real life despite being 21, but I think I'd make a really good trucker. I hope they add Iowa soon, that's my favorite state. I especially love the city of Davenport Iowa. I hope that if the developers add the state of Iowa they also include the city of Davenport. I am not from Iowa by the way, in fact I've never been there, so I am not biased when I say that Iowa is the best state and my favorite and that Davenport is also a great city which I hope is added to the game in the near future. Davenport has really amazing princess parties, I hope those are also included in the Davenport Iowa dlc. Please SCS, include the princess parties in Davenport Iowa when you are creating the Davenport Iowa dlc."

American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"[h1] By far one of the best simulation games currently on the market, [/h1]

In 2002, a small, barely known software company known as SCS Software released it's first trucking simulation game, 18 Wheels of Steel: Hard Truck. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318750/ Fast forward to 2016, and SCS has returned to its roots with American Truck Simulator. Like Euro Truck Simulator 2, Euro Truck Simulator and the multitude of 18 Wheels of Steel titles before it, American Truck Simulator continues a tradition of realistic simulation games from the now famed Czech developer/publisher. Get behind the wheel of the most popular brands of trucks, with an ever-expanding list of makes and models made available free with frequent updates combined with a constantly expanding list of states to drive through, from California to Washington to Colorado, with Wyoming and Texas on their way in the near future, it's clear that SCS has their heart and soul in both ATS and ETS 2, being what I could consider two of the most frequently updated games since their initial release dates. 

Speaking of updates, the frequency at which that SCS updates this game and it's sister title, Euro Truck Simulator 2, shows the dedication they carry and the devotion they have to their player base. Some may say it really is the #BestCommunityEver, with player counts having reached an all time high since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, and even that couldn't slow down the team as they powered through 2020 with the same positivity and dedication as they had in previous years. Combine the periodic updates improving a game built on what could be considered an [u] ancient [/u] game engine by today's standards, SCS continues to beat AAA studios at their own game in a niche market flooded with cheap imitations. This is highlighted by the recent 1.40 update, which introduced a brand new lighting system, drastically improving the realism of the game world by an unprecedented amount, and not long before that, the 1.37 update introduced the open-source FMOD sound engine, allowing for more realistic sounds to be implemented into the game.

Going back on the #BestCommunityEver, SCS continues to impress by being one of the most supportive studios when it comes to mods. That's right, a little game studio with less than 500 people based out of Prague makes games and actively supports it's modding community more than most AAA studios could even dream of, and in my opinion they even beat out Bethesda Softworks in terms of the modding tools they offer to the community, from official modelling plugins for Blender to the official Steam Workshop upload tool. They've even gone as far as to hire a number of members of the modding community, including legends like SiSL and 50keda, famous for SiSL's Mega Pack and the extensive DAF XF reworks respectively. They'll even go as far as to leave extreme detail in their patch notes for each update to inform modders of the changes they've made to the game that will affect mods as they are developed. 

If you're looking to play with friends, I would suggest the TruckersMP mod, available for both ATS and ETS 2. It receives frequent updates, and is often updated days if not weeks after each update dropped by SCS. However, if you already play TruckersMP but want something a bit more stable that will work on release day for every future update, then I highly encourage you to check out Convoys, a feature coming in update 1.41. Having previewed Convoys in the experimental branch prior to Open Beta, this is an officially supported multiplayer system, some might even liken it to co-op, complete with AI synchronization, something that TruckersMP currently lacks. Currently, Convoys only supports 8 players, a far cry from the several thousand player support across multiple servers with TruckersMP, but that doesn't mean you should count out Convoys at all. SCS promises to improve the system even further, and who knows how far they'll go with this new mode. Mod support on Convoys is currently unavailable for stability reasons, but that doesn't mean that SCS [u] will never [/u] support mods for it in future updates. It's a great alternative if you want something that's a bit more down-scaled and a bit more interactive, with roadside scenarios and detours being synchronized for each player. 

In conclusion, if you want a game that lets you work at your own pace and enjoy exploration, then there really isn't a reason for you to not pick up this game. With the starting point price $19.99  it's not going to break the bank like a AAA title might at $59.99, and the consistent updates and map expansions make American Truck Simulator a game worth investing in."
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,truck
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"well i've both game in my library ETS and ATS though i like ATS more because it's just feels different , i just can't explain it well but surely this game magical elixir for people who are facing Anxiety/Depression during Pandemic it's really works like a drug and instant anxiety reliever. simulation features are perfect and gives you real life driving simulator experience ... no doubt why reviews are Overwhelmingly Positive.. it's awesome game to try with steering wheel... i am really enjoying it and looking forward to buying all remaining dlc if they decide to low down prices little bit in sale time.. overall must game for people who want to experience real truck driving.. buy without hesitation and support the developers."
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"Hi guys I want to go with different comment:
Its great and I enjoy this game its real simulation truck,but after a while it will repeated and a little boring,but I have many suggestions:
hey developers did u ever think about it to make a story for it?story is missing in this game,yeah I buy new truck new company ,upgrade it and so on...but really if there was a little talking with other guys in trucks or company's,u could talk with employees,or even polices and other driver,u could make a story like going into snows,get stock in snow,or engine burnt,or going to eat something,I think if the company get some option in to game that we could on it or off it by our opinion,like going WC,food need,chat with other guys and go online,joining event and going to teamwork,even making company with real people,joining,firing,and get it another way of playing to be more real,more fun,make journey,digging mine and get some gold or digging tunnel and make new roads,and many other idea i think about it,it certainly will be game of the year ,I believe it,u are overwhelming just now,think about what I say,a strong story,and online player,teams,company ,events and if u want to hear more of my idea just tell me,"
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"Although the sensation of driving a bit similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2, this game has a thick American landscape and atmosphere, which is very suitable for those who are seeking for a realistic simulation games."
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,vroom vroom
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,i drive exclusively on the shoulder at full speed to avoid speeding tickets
American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"Great simulation experience. Get into your truck and take your load. Open your favourite playlist. And enjoy the peaceful journey on the roads of USA.

If you want, you can travel through America with your friends. Imo this is the best part of the game. And ATS MP community isn't toxic like ETS2 MP.

But game isn't great. Most of the map is desert and looks same. The map is too small in the standard version (without DLC's) of the game. And you need to pay money to more.

Cities: Skylines does an amazing job of what its trying to achieve. A [b]proper city building[/b] game. In essence, even the business model behind this game achieves this. A game with rapid DLC production means a game with CONSTANT content and support, subsequently creating a huge modding community. These modifications change the game in incredibly meaningful ways. From intricate traffic management (TM:PE), to ULT and lighting adaptations. This allows the player to transport themselves into the most realistic, beautiful looking places you could imagine. From just a small, pitstop gas station in the desert to large transport networks and interchanges, you can make anything you might see in real life traveling in your car.

Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,It is a prime city builder. Best of any I've tried.
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,its worth the money!
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"[h1] Cities Skylines is simply the best city building game out there! [/h1]
As a fan of all the SimCity games, I hated seeing the downfall of SimCity in 2013 but I was so grateful when this came out. No other game of this kind can compete with it.

[b] Pros: [/b] 
[b] 1. [/b] It is extremely detailed! Basically every logical thing was thought of and added by the developers. 
[b] 2. [/b] The graphics are pretty good. It's not very important for this kind of game; but still, it looks nice.
[b] 3. [/b] Map size is huge! You can spend over a hundred hours easily to build a single city. With mods, it's even bigger!
[b] 4. [/b] It comes included with a map, asset, theme, and scenario editor allowing you to easily create your own custom content. 
[b] 5. [/b] Modding support is simply the best! There are 10's of thousands of mods to pick from, allowing you to completely customize your city however you want, as well as adding new ways to play. 
6. The developers are continuing to support the game even after 6 years.

[b] Cons: [/b]
[b] 1. [/b] The game does require a beefy system to maintain playability. The larger your city becomes, the worse it gets. For myself, Playing with an RTX 3080, Ryzen 7 5800x and 32Gb of RAM, I get around 30fps in my city with 100k population. Optimization could definitely be better.
[b] 2. [/b]  There is a small amount of tutorials in game. Given it's great detail, it can take awhile for new players to learn how everything works. 
[b] 3. [/b] DLC's have gotten out of hand over the years. There are so many DLC's, that for new players it's hard to know which is even worth buying. Some of them are great and worth your consideration, others are just nearly useless and a waste of money. Not to mention, you can download mods that make some DLC worthless. It's 2021 so I suppose you can't expect much less then being flooded with more DLC to buy.

Overall, it's simply the best city building/city simulation game currently on the market. Given the nearly endless amount of mods, there is always ways to build your city better, bigger and more detailed. I highly recommend the game! Your money will be well spent."
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,you idiodick people play this game now!!
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,Fun city building
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"I'll keep it short.. I used to not want to try this game because I thought Sim City franchise was better. I was a Sim City Puritan, even when they released their last Sim City (which was pleasing to look at, nice to play for most part but very limited in capacity tbh). It took me few years after released of this game to get into it, with all the DLCs, Content Creator packs (Which is a great initiative, kudos to Paradox for introducing and allowing this) and I am blown away with how wonderful this game is, and how difficult and challenging it can be too. I love the dynamics of the game with everything that we do down to the granule decisions and implication that comes with it. I have no complain tbh, I wish for more contents though. More is good!

I really was thinking if would be great if yall could come up with some political systems to this game.. that would be groundbreaking. Socialism, Capitalism, etc. and see how it affects city building and the people's reactions."

Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,It is a prime city builder. Best of any I've tried.
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,its worth the money!
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"[h1] Cities Skylines is simply the best city building game out there! [/h1]
As a fan of all the SimCity games, I hated seeing the downfall of SimCity in 2013 but I was so grateful when this came out. No other game of this kind can compete with it.

[b] Pros: [/b] 
[b] 1. [/b] It is extremely detailed! Basically every logical thing was thought of and added by the developers. 
[b] 2. [/b] The graphics are pretty good. It's not very important for this kind of game; but still, it looks nice.
[b] 3. [/b] Map size is huge! You can spend over a hundred hours easily to build a single city. With mods, it's even bigger!
[b] 4. [/b] It comes included with a map, asset, theme, and scenario editor allowing you to easily create your own custom content. 
[b] 5. [/b] Modding support is simply the best! There are 10's of thousands of mods to pick from, allowing you to completely customize your city however you want, as well as adding new ways to play. 
6. The developers are continuing to support the game even after 6 years.

[b] Cons: [/b]
[b] 1. [/b] The game does require a beefy system to maintain playability. The larger your city becomes, the worse it gets. For myself, Playing with an RTX 3080, Ryzen 7 5800x and 32Gb of RAM, I get around 30fps in my city with 100k population. Optimization could definitely be better.
[b] 2. [/b]  There is a small amount of tutorials in game. Given it's great detail, it can take awhile for new players to learn how everything works. 
[b] 3. [/b] DLC's have gotten out of hand over the years. There are so many DLC's, that for new players it's hard to know which is even worth buying. Some of them are great and worth your consideration, others are just nearly useless and a waste of money. Not to mention, you can download mods that make some DLC worthless. It's 2021 so I suppose you can't expect much less then being flooded with more DLC to buy.

Overall, it's simply the best city building/city simulation game currently on the market. Given the nearly endless amount of mods, there is always ways to build your city better, bigger and more detailed. I highly recommend the game! Your money will be well spent."

Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,Fun city building
Cities: Skylines,Strategy,255710,"I'll keep it short.. I used to not want to try this game because I thought Sim City franchise was better. I was a Sim City Puritan, even when they released their last Sim City (which was pleasing to look at, nice to play for most part but very limited in capacity tbh). It took me few years after released of this game to get into it, with all the DLCs, Content Creator packs (Which is a great initiative, kudos to Paradox for introducing and allowing this) and I am blown away with how wonderful this game is, and how difficult and challenging it can be too. I love the dynamics of the game with everything that we do down to the granule decisions and implication that comes with it. I have no complain tbh, I wish for more contents though. More is good!

I really was thinking if would be great if yall could come up with some political systems to this game.. that would be groundbreaking. Socialism, Capitalism, etc. and see how it affects city building and the people's reactions."

War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"An excellent and unique game that gets worse and worse as time goes. Gaijin's lust and greed for $$$ has driven this game into an unenjoyable grindfest. After tier two, it's like running into a brickwall to progress. At this point, spending money is almost necessary to unlock planes/tanks sanely. Since Patch 1.37 in Dec 2013, Gaijin completely overhauled the research system for the sole purpose to make more money off players. Since then, everything has increased in price, and reward amounts have dropped. Tanks, aircrafts, modifications, and crew proficiencies prices have all gone up, while RP points, silver lions, and crew points are capped and less abundant. 

Balance is utter crap too. A 5.0 battle rating prop plane can meet a 6.3 post-war jet fighter. There are numerous planes under and over-tiered with discrepancies in battle rating. 

The game is in a terrible state at the moment, and I don't see Gaijin turning anything around anytime soon. The whopping drop in playerbase over the last year (or even months) says a lot."

Any time I think of starting a new account I just look back to when they practically ordered their forum members to put copyright strikes against any contributor who reports and proves that hacking is going on in their games.  Speaking as a player who has been pilot sniped from 7km away and through a mountain, I find what they've done to be reprehensible.  Lying afterwards and saying they didn't mean it like that is just plain hilarious.  Do I recommend this game?  No, I really can't bring my self to do that, if only because of how they treat people who support them."

War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"TL:DR
Updated: Don't play this game and certainly don't purchase anything on their store. They don’t deserve the money for the experience they are giving you at this time. Still predatory as fuck

For more information, read on.






Update: Re-installed for about 2 months and uninstalled it once again.


Still predatory, Maps are more varied and you can now try to avoid the bad ones  (Up to a certain number and you can out-right ban only one or Two IIRC if you have Premium.), vehicle selection is nice still however grinding is very much a problem still and their idea of balance still insists upon making the grind worse for certain vehicles with increased repair costs and the ilk. 

The Game plays well, but it’s vehicles as they stand need to be spread out. Things are too close together and you have tanks from different eras that just don’t belong and shouldn’t fight in certain areas and the ilk. 

If you’re looking for a simulator experience stay away, it’s janky at best and over all is unsatisfying. Night Vision devices are a nice feature and help make Night Battles less painful. Helicopters are a pain, both to use and to have used on you. There are no good hard counters that can really reach out and touch them from the pedestal they sit on. You must spawn in an AA on the first round to try and make sure people aren’t ganked by a wallet warrior in their chopper. 

In lower Tiers the PE-8 is cancerous in that a squad can rush and kill early and quickly, die/’J’ Out, and then spawn in the PE-8. Then, begin using the PE-8’s to pound opposing forces into the mud with a steady whistle-boom of the largest bombs in the game. The PE-8 and it’s largest bomb NEED to be more prohibitively expensive due to how the bomb ignores cover. You can be behind a fucking hill and still get shredded. I mean in a fucking VALLEY Behind a deep hill, the bomb on the other side, and you’ll still die; On the edge of the bombs’ radius and you’ll still die. 

The game as it stands is still broken and you can’t advocate boycotting their store on their own forums in protest of how the game is to make a point. Which is fair, but they certainly can’t stop that here. 

https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/12738-war-thunder-rules/

1.1.7. Encourage other users to stop playing the game, or encourage users to avoid purchasing any content from the store, in order to prove a point.


Fuck you guys. While I won’t break you rules on your forums because, hey, it makes sense that you’d stop that kind of talk on your official forums. You can’t stop that here. I stand by what I said in my previous review with this as an update. 


I’ll still install the game haphazardly to see if you guys are making progress in addressing the issues the community is facing. Spawn Camping, Map Design issues (Players Mountain Goating and sniping into the Spawn), Spawn trapping, as well as the abuse of Helicopters. 

You guys refuse to acknowledge that Spawn Camping is a problem in this game. You have ignored us saying that we’d like free FPE or Parts or solutions that would make having those ‘modules’ less painful. Vehicles can have FPE MODELED in or ON the machine and it won’t be free. IT can be STANDARD FOR THAT MODEL OF VEHICLE AND YOU’LL STILL NOT INCLUDE IT.

Saying, “Oh, then why don’t we give everyone a Free-Abrams too.” Or some such, IIRC. 


Don’t purchase anything from the store and just in-general avoid the game. Still predatory as fuck 





Old Review:
It's fuckin' predatory in the way they handle their player base. It handles map design poorly and overall makes the game a grind with no feeling of accomplishment, just the grind. It's predatory in the way it uses its little rewards to make you want to log in every day.

Community events, while sometimes fun, are generally painful and just frustrating.

I'm uninstalling and never looking back. This game is a bad game, it's not ugly, it's just fuckin' predatory. They use what I feel like are Skinner Boxes to encourage the user to continue to play.

See:

http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/experienced-points/15510-Skinner-Boxes-and-How-Games-Use-Them

For a good explanation.

Regardless don't play it and leave it alone. The game isn't worth the effort, I've wasted time and money on this until I realized just how dumb this shit is. . . 

Fuck you Gaijin for the way you treat players."
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"To begin...
Do not listen to the negative reviews about all the Russian bias because the developers are Russian.

Every country is good in their own way.
For example:
Americans: Large amount of ammo, mostly acrobatic, good offence, generally bad defence
Japanese: Large amount of ammo, very acrobatic, good offence at higher calibres, very bad defence
Russians: Low amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, defence spans from good to horrible depending on plane.
British: Decent amount of ammo, acrobatic, good offence, average defence
Germans: Large amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, average defence



The game mechanics in this game are very good. 
The diversity of planes is very good.
You can play as army or aviation (tanks/ground vehicles or planes)
Diverse selection of maps 
Many gamemodes

There are 3 levels of difficulty:
Arcade - Recomended for new players who are still getting a feel for the mechanics - includes lead indicator to assist aim and planes do not rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available - enemy and friendly players stand out
Realistic - Recomended for seasoned players who understand the mechanics - does not include lead indicator, planes can rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available- friendly planes stand out, enemy planes must be close enough for the pilot to identify the type of plane
Simulator - True realism - Recommended for expert players - does not include lead indicator - locked to first person - enemy and friendly planes are not distinguishable until the player can identify them - basically simulating the WW2 battles.

The game features a tree-like unlocking system, which includes 5 tiers of planes. As the tiers go higher so does the advancement of planes. There is an option to pay real money to unlock planes, however these planes can be unlocked without paying any extra money. There are also 'premium' planes, which can either be unlocked in bundles or bought. These planes cannot be unlocked without paying real money and also grant the user bonus experience from the plane. These planes grant little advantage to the user.

The matchmaking system depends on two things.
1 - Tier of the plane
2 - Battle Ranking of the plane

If you have a tier one plane - you will be matched with tier one planes, BUT if you have a tier one plane that has a Battle Ranking of 2.3, you will be matched with Tier one and Tier two planes, which have a battle ranking of 2-2.3. This system is continued throughout the entire game.

TL;DR
The Russian Bias in this game is not anything crazy like the community has exaggerated it to be. Every country has its advantaged and disadvantages. The game is very expansive with its content and the mechanics are well made. The game has many difficulty levels targeted for new players and expert players. There are microtransactions however you will be at no disadvantage if you do not participate in them. The matchmaking system is dependant on Tier and Battle Ranking.

War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"I really LOVE flying, so its hard to not recommend this game but, it has some drawbacks.

War Thunder is a pay to gain an advantage game.

Like many others now, trying this shifty system of  subscriptions etc, it seems pretty effective, I see people in purchased planes all the time and you dont stand much chance in a 1 on 1 with most of them as most of them have a much heavier 1 second burst from the guns / cannons, so you in a crappy plane , you have paid nothing to develop yet, man your such a victim in this game, that is , right there the definition of pay to win or pay to gain an advantage, a definition well established from the days of DOS to current day.

Right, dont expect DCS levels of flight realism, totally different game, this game is the arcade version of flight sims, its brilliant in that regard.

What it does do is give kids a much better understanding of a 3d environment, and parents alike, lol, and it brings people together in large games where your almost never facing the same set of players twice, everyone gets jumbled in that server matching system from what I can tell.

Flying itself, for an arcade style game, is pretty damned impressive, I like that you can use a HOTAS joy or mouse or both and keyboard and all buttons Ive needed so far are bind-able, so thats a heap of great work in the backend of the game you dont usually see, done very well, almost perfect.
The game does not feel quite the same on a joystick, I find myself often just playing in the lounge on second PC with mouse, while youngling also uses the mouse, always, but when you fly with the joy, its not quite as simple to aim, but its still pretty good.

Just for pure fun, is a blast for say 2 hours a day, to get rid of that, I MUST FLY itch, lol, works wonders, that or you grab an RC plane / chopper like we have and hit the real skies !

Overall  I like the game, hate the business plan, but they did such a good job on the game itself, its still worth playing just to experience the WW2 planes and great modelling.

You can do all your planes up with custom paint jobs etc, you can buy with real money your countries own real flag for your planes etc.

"
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"Allright.

This game. This game is testament that shitty devs can fuck up a very good game concept. I have played this game for a long time on and off. However, over the last few patches, the game really has taken a nosedive when it comes to enjoyability. 
First, the Planes, which is the most mature and well developed part of the game. the Models look great, as does the scenery. It however, has a lot of problems, first up, the way players interact with AI ground targets is mindnumbingly dumb. On each map, the AI has a predetermined winner, meaning, that without player intereference, one side will always win, as their ground units cap the objective. This is problem number one as it promotes hiding and drawing out the game, given everybody knows who wins on which maps, which means that 90% of the time, you end up chasing some AFK fuck that is lounging at 11k altitude without having done anything...
The Second major problem with planes is still, as it was in 1.25, Flight modelling. compared to the competition, its frankly terrible. Gaijin attempted to remedy this via ""Tournament standard"" flight models, but as a few tests indicate, even these are far from standard, with frankly mindboggling behavior such as a failure to stall, wonky control surfaces and odd use of superchargers. Compared to its next to competitors (IL-2 and Wargamings World of Warplanes) it falls miserably short compared to the first, while overall, not being that much better then the second, which advertises itself as a casual arcade type of sim. 
Overall, if Planes were the only thing, i'd rate the game a 6.5/10, it can be decently enjoyable, if at times, mindnumbingly frustrating.

Now onto Tanks. Which is the middle brother of the modes, and involves 2 teams usually fighting over a cap point. My first issue, cap points, unlike with planes, are completely random, consisting of a circle somewhere in the middle of nowhere, usually in the center of the map. Whereas with Planes, you got an inkling of what your actual goal is, tanks is akin to being a gladiator in an arena, with only a simple, go kill the badguys to justify your actions. This is made worse by the terrible, claustrofobic map design which is to promote the use of 1 shot killing Howitzers (that in most modes, would suffer heavily of hte shelldrop, combined with the need to guesstimate the distance) over high velocity anti tank guns. This is made even worse by the pitful zoom that you get, making putting in accurate fire at ranges over 500meters nearly impossible.
The second major issue, is the basic game mechanics of shell behavior and armor. Both are incredibly borked, and have been so from the beginning. for a Game that presents itself as historical and realistic, its very much neither. For instance, whereas In Real life, calibers of 85mm or more would overmatch sloped armor, ingame that doesn't happen except for huge calibers like the Soviet 122mm, which, combined with the aforementioned mapdesign, makes it really frustrating for anybody that wants to drive anything else then Russians. 
The Ingame T-34 needs to plant a single hit on his opponent to kill him. the British Cromwell, which frequently faces it (and for some reason, has no reverse gear) needs to plant shots into each individual crewman, because shell spalling is only a minor inconvienience, whereas explosives are teh wrath of God.
Finally, unlike WoT, the chance to bounce is not set, and is completely RNG to the point that HESH, which pancakes onto a surface, can actually bounce off an angled plate.
rating 3/10. Horrible, buggy and frustrating, not helped by devs that are more interested in pushing out content then in fixing the mode.

Now onto the devs themselves. They are bad, atleast their gamedesign is. Balance is a mess, with many over and underpowered machines sitting at ranks where they have no business to be. official response, ""balancing is done through numbers."" This has lead to the amusing situation where you had the A6M5 zero, an aircraft that has a top speed of 540kph was considered to be a balanced matchup for the P-80C shooting star, which went nearly twice as fast, had far better controls, and was supposed to go up to equivalent aircraft like the Meteor. While some of the more special ones have been removed, the point remains, there is no idea to balance it, and any suggestion about changing it is met with a resolute mocking and telling people that having biplanes facing off against B-17's is the only alternative.
In Tanks, its even worse, given that the spread is identical, which means that its not uncommon to find yourself in a position where you are outgunned and cannot do anything really, because of hte fact your gun cannot penetrate his armor from any angle. In Gaijin's view, this is considered a fair match.

"
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"There is only one word that I can say to describe this game...




Boi.



This is definetly one of my top 5 Games to play list. The realism is amazing, the physics are great, the use of the ultra-low graphic settings makes this game absolutely playable on a laptop (max fps I got for this game was 47 fps). 

Definetly get this game"

War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"This game is very hard to advance in. No matter which tier of tanks I'm in,  at least half of the tanks are the next tier which a majority of them my tanks barely damage while they can 1 hit mine and destroy them. I was in tier 2 with 5 tanks to choose from. I was fighting tier 3 tanks the majority of the time. Finally I managed to get 3 tier 3 tanks and when I go to battle I'm fighting tier 4 tanks. There has been many times where I've hit the other tank 7 or 8 times and not crippling it. If you cant get kills you cant advance your tanks hardly at all."
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"After 1,500+ hours in this game, I can safely say this game is utter trash. This game had so much potential but was wasted on a greedy company like gaijin who cares about money more than quallity or listening to the player base. The only saving factor of it is that no one else has made a game quite like it. Once I see a competent studio release such a game I will uninstall War Thunder that instant. War Thunder has a horrible grind for new vehicles that keeps getting added to every 1-2 months with new broken vehicles. They incentivise you to pay money to reduce the grind and yet don't fix the existing problems. The company is so greedy that they will not even stop at installing practically malware on your computer ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/5j221b/gaijinnet_agent/ ) that my best guess when running in the background tracks your data and uses it to advertize even more or sell to other companies for even more of a profit. This is a game riddled with problems that the development company doesnt bother fixing because they are too busy trying to make get more money out of the users whatever way they can. i would never recommend this game in the current state even after just going out of beta stage a few months ago. The top tier gameplay is tough to get to and broken to all hell once you get there. Avoid this game if you can.

4,865 hours. game is still shit"
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,cool
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"War Thunder offers a great multiplayer experience of WW2/CW aerial and tank warfare. It has to be mentioned that visuals, gameplay and optimization are top notch. This game also features the best damage model I´ve encountered in a game of this sort. Hits and casualties are visualized with a unique picture-in-picture feedback which is very satisfying. Realistic and simulator mode are offered for people that look for the realistic fun which is a big pro.

But if you want to experience the great fidelity WT offers but aren´t willing to tone down your graphics to Playstation 1 90s standard in order to stay ""competitive"" then expect to have a big spotting disadvantage and also prepare to get blasted trough foliage, smoke and even solid objects. I don´t like to shout ""hax!"" and I don´t know how bad or good really the cheating situation is in War Thunder but take a look at the very low vs high graphic comparsion screenshots or get a impression for yourself and you´ll understand how people are able to pull of those shots. It is great that Gaijin also gives the low spec players the ability to participate but low graphic settings should never give you an advantage. I really hope Gayjin will fix that.

Also tank simulator fans may be disappointed that the tank warfare has not much to do with real tank operations. Many maps and objective placement force you to fight in tight places where everyone tries to ambush each other which unfortunately relies on heavy use of the 3p camera and gamey map marking. While this is of course fun I find the lack of big wide battlegrounds and real tank battles very frustrating. There are some maps that offer this experience but the community tend to avoid or dislike them because it takes too much time and patience for spotting and calculating a proper fire solution. Time that people want to spent with the grinding.  

Which bringes me to a big problem. This game suffers from horrible research points and silver lions grind from Tier 4 upwards even with premium account and boosting Talisman or premium vehicles. To all normal people that aren´t willing to spent their whole live on one game, that have careers, activites, sports, and social life to attend, be ready to wait a long time or to invest really big sums of money in order to see your favorite high tier tank in your garage. 

I´m okay with F2P games that ask you for some cash in order to save you time but this game has a absurd and greedy pricing. Monetization all over the place. Yeah die hard fans will tell you the grind isn´t that bad and paying money is not needed. Strangely most top tier players I´ve met have spent 200 - 300 dollars on average on this game for talismans, ingame currency, premium accounts, and vehicles. 

The described cons sadly leaves a very bad impression and is the reason why I´m not getting in love with this game and have to give a negative rating. 

To be fair it has to mentioned that there is at least no real pay to win in this game. You can purchase backup vehicles or buy camouflage objects but this has not much of an impact. More important is the fact that you can´t equip your vehicles with some premium boosters or powerful ammunitions for real money like in other games.  

I´ll recommend you to aim for your favourite Tier 2/3 vehicles which are unlocked in a reasonable amount of time. Stay with this tiers, they´re really fun - gameplay and tank-mix wise - and stop worrying about the grind and the tier 5 but play the objective and for fun."
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"An excellent and unique game that gets worse and worse as time goes. Gaijin's lust and greed for $$$ has driven this game into an unenjoyable grindfest. After tier two, it's like running into a brickwall to progress. At this point, spending money is almost necessary to unlock planes/tanks sanely. Since Patch 1.37 in Dec 2013, Gaijin completely overhauled the research system for the sole purpose to make more money off players. Since then, everything has increased in price, and reward amounts have dropped. Tanks, aircrafts, modifications, and crew proficiencies prices have all gone up, while RP points, silver lions, and crew points are capped and less abundant. 

Balance is utter crap too. A 5.0 battle rating prop plane can meet a 6.3 post-war jet fighter. There are numerous planes under and over-tiered with discrepancies in battle rating. 

The game is in a terrible state at the moment, and I don't see Gaijin turning anything around anytime soon. The whopping drop in playerbase over the last year (or even months) says a lot."

War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"TL:DR
Updated: Don't play this game and certainly don't purchase anything on their store. They don’t deserve the money for the experience they are giving you at this time. Still predatory as fuck

For more information, read on.






Update: Re-installed for about 2 months and uninstalled it once again.


Still predatory, Maps are more varied and you can now try to avoid the bad ones  (Up to a certain number and you can out-right ban only one or Two IIRC if you have Premium.), vehicle selection is nice still however grinding is very much a problem still and their idea of balance still insists upon making the grind worse for certain vehicles with increased repair costs and the ilk. 

The Game plays well, but it’s vehicles as they stand need to be spread out. Things are too close together and you have tanks from different eras that just don’t belong and shouldn’t fight in certain areas and the ilk. 

If you’re looking for a simulator experience stay away, it’s janky at best and over all is unsatisfying. Night Vision devices are a nice feature and help make Night Battles less painful. Helicopters are a pain, both to use and to have used on you. There are no good hard counters that can really reach out and touch them from the pedestal they sit on. You must spawn in an AA on the first round to try and make sure people aren’t ganked by a wallet warrior in their chopper. 

In lower Tiers the PE-8 is cancerous in that a squad can rush and kill early and quickly, die/’J’ Out, and then spawn in the PE-8. Then, begin using the PE-8’s to pound opposing forces into the mud with a steady whistle-boom of the largest bombs in the game. The PE-8 and it’s largest bomb NEED to be more prohibitively expensive due to how the bomb ignores cover. You can be behind a fucking hill and still get shredded. I mean in a fucking VALLEY Behind a deep hill, the bomb on the other side, and you’ll still die; On the edge of the bombs’ radius and you’ll still die. 

The game as it stands is still broken and you can’t advocate boycotting their store on their own forums in protest of how the game is to make a point. Which is fair, but they certainly can’t stop that here. 

https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/12738-war-thunder-rules/

1.1.7. Encourage other users to stop playing the game, or encourage users to avoid purchasing any content from the store, in order to prove a point.


Fuck you guys. While I won’t break you rules on your forums because, hey, it makes sense that you’d stop that kind of talk on your official forums. You can’t stop that here. I stand by what I said in my previous review with this as an update. 


I’ll still install the game haphazardly to see if you guys are making progress in addressing the issues the community is facing. Spawn Camping, Map Design issues (Players Mountain Goating and sniping into the Spawn), Spawn trapping, as well as the abuse of Helicopters. 

You guys refuse to acknowledge that Spawn Camping is a problem in this game. You have ignored us saying that we’d like free FPE or Parts or solutions that would make having those ‘modules’ less painful. Vehicles can have FPE MODELED in or ON the machine and it won’t be free. IT can be STANDARD FOR THAT MODEL OF VEHICLE AND YOU’LL STILL NOT INCLUDE IT.

Saying, “Oh, then why don’t we give everyone a Free-Abrams too.” Or some such, IIRC. 


Don’t purchase anything from the store and just in-general avoid the game. Still predatory as fuck 





Old Review:
It's fuckin' predatory in the way they handle their player base. It handles map design poorly and overall makes the game a grind with no feeling of accomplishment, just the grind. It's predatory in the way it uses its little rewards to make you want to log in every day.

Community events, while sometimes fun, are generally painful and just frustrating.

I'm uninstalling and never looking back. This game is a bad game, it's not ugly, it's just fuckin' predatory. They use what I feel like are Skinner Boxes to encourage the user to continue to play.

See:

http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/experienced-points/15510-Skinner-Boxes-and-How-Games-Use-Them

For a good explanation.

Regardless don't play it and leave it alone. The game isn't worth the effort, I've wasted time and money on this until I realized just how dumb this shit is. . . 

Fuck you Gaijin for the way you treat players."
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"To begin...
Do not listen to the negative reviews about all the Russian bias because the developers are Russian.

Every country is good in their own way.
For example:
Americans: Large amount of ammo, mostly acrobatic, good offence, generally bad defence
Japanese: Large amount of ammo, very acrobatic, good offence at higher calibres, very bad defence
Russians: Low amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, defence spans from good to horrible depending on plane.
British: Decent amount of ammo, acrobatic, good offence, average defence
Germans: Large amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, average defence



The game mechanics in this game are very good. 
The diversity of planes is very good.
You can play as army or aviation (tanks/ground vehicles or planes)
Diverse selection of maps 
Many gamemodes

There are 3 levels of difficulty:
Arcade - Recomended for new players who are still getting a feel for the mechanics - includes lead indicator to assist aim and planes do not rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available - enemy and friendly players stand out
Realistic - Recomended for seasoned players who understand the mechanics - does not include lead indicator, planes can rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available- friendly planes stand out, enemy planes must be close enough for the pilot to identify the type of plane
Simulator - True realism - Recommended for expert players - does not include lead indicator - locked to first person - enemy and friendly planes are not distinguishable until the player can identify them - basically simulating the WW2 battles.

The game features a tree-like unlocking system, which includes 5 tiers of planes. As the tiers go higher so does the advancement of planes. There is an option to pay real money to unlock planes, however these planes can be unlocked without paying any extra money. There are also 'premium' planes, which can either be unlocked in bundles or bought. These planes cannot be unlocked without paying real money and also grant the user bonus experience from the plane. These planes grant little advantage to the user.

The matchmaking system depends on two things.
1 - Tier of the plane
2 - Battle Ranking of the plane

If you have a tier one plane - you will be matched with tier one planes, BUT if you have a tier one plane that has a Battle Ranking of 2.3, you will be matched with Tier one and Tier two planes, which have a battle ranking of 2-2.3. This system is continued throughout the entire game.

TL;DR
The Russian Bias in this game is not anything crazy like the community has exaggerated it to be. Every country has its advantaged and disadvantages. The game is very expansive with its content and the mechanics are well made. The game has many difficulty levels targeted for new players and expert players. There are microtransactions however you will be at no disadvantage if you do not participate in them. The matchmaking system is dependant on Tier and Battle Ranking.

War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"I really LOVE flying, so its hard to not recommend this game but, it has some drawbacks.

War Thunder is a pay to gain an advantage game.

Like many others now, trying this shifty system of  subscriptions etc, it seems pretty effective, I see people in purchased planes all the time and you dont stand much chance in a 1 on 1 with most of them as most of them have a much heavier 1 second burst from the guns / cannons, so you in a crappy plane , you have paid nothing to develop yet, man your such a victim in this game, that is , right there the definition of pay to win or pay to gain an advantage, a definition well established from the days of DOS to current day.

Right, dont expect DCS levels of flight realism, totally different game, this game is the arcade version of flight sims, its brilliant in that regard.

What it does do is give kids a much better understanding of a 3d environment, and parents alike, lol, and it brings people together in large games where your almost never facing the same set of players twice, everyone gets jumbled in that server matching system from what I can tell.

Flying itself, for an arcade style game, is pretty damned impressive, I like that you can use a HOTAS joy or mouse or both and keyboard and all buttons Ive needed so far are bind-able, so thats a heap of great work in the backend of the game you dont usually see, done very well, almost perfect.
The game does not feel quite the same on a joystick, I find myself often just playing in the lounge on second PC with mouse, while youngling also uses the mouse, always, but when you fly with the joy, its not quite as simple to aim, but its still pretty good.

Just for pure fun, is a blast for say 2 hours a day, to get rid of that, I MUST FLY itch, lol, works wonders, that or you grab an RC plane / chopper like we have and hit the real skies !

Overall  I like the game, hate the business plan, but they did such a good job on the game itself, its still worth playing just to experience the WW2 planes and great modelling.

You can do all your planes up with custom paint jobs etc, you can buy with real money your countries own real flag for your planes etc.

"
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"Allright.

This game. This game is testament that shitty devs can fuck up a very good game concept. I have played this game for a long time on and off. However, over the last few patches, the game really has taken a nosedive when it comes to enjoyability. 
First, the Planes, which is the most mature and well developed part of the game. the Models look great, as does the scenery. It however, has a lot of problems, first up, the way players interact with AI ground targets is mindnumbingly dumb. On each map, the AI has a predetermined winner, meaning, that without player intereference, one side will always win, as their ground units cap the objective. This is problem number one as it promotes hiding and drawing out the game, given everybody knows who wins on which maps, which means that 90% of the time, you end up chasing some AFK fuck that is lounging at 11k altitude without having done anything...
The Second major problem with planes is still, as it was in 1.25, Flight modelling. compared to the competition, its frankly terrible. Gaijin attempted to remedy this via ""Tournament standard"" flight models, but as a few tests indicate, even these are far from standard, with frankly mindboggling behavior such as a failure to stall, wonky control surfaces and odd use of superchargers. Compared to its next to competitors (IL-2 and Wargamings World of Warplanes) it falls miserably short compared to the first, while overall, not being that much better then the second, which advertises itself as a casual arcade type of sim. 
Overall, if Planes were the only thing, i'd rate the game a 6.5/10, it can be decently enjoyable, if at times, mindnumbingly frustrating.

Now onto Tanks. Which is the middle brother of the modes, and involves 2 teams usually fighting over a cap point. My first issue, cap points, unlike with planes, are completely random, consisting of a circle somewhere in the middle of nowhere, usually in the center of the map. Whereas with Planes, you got an inkling of what your actual goal is, tanks is akin to being a gladiator in an arena, with only a simple, go kill the badguys to justify your actions. This is made worse by the terrible, claustrofobic map design which is to promote the use of 1 shot killing Howitzers (that in most modes, would suffer heavily of hte shelldrop, combined with the need to guesstimate the distance) over high velocity anti tank guns. This is made even worse by the pitful zoom that you get, making putting in accurate fire at ranges over 500meters nearly impossible.
The second major issue, is the basic game mechanics of shell behavior and armor. Both are incredibly borked, and have been so from the beginning. for a Game that presents itself as historical and realistic, its very much neither. For instance, whereas In Real life, calibers of 85mm or more would overmatch sloped armor, ingame that doesn't happen except for huge calibers like the Soviet 122mm, which, combined with the aforementioned mapdesign, makes it really frustrating for anybody that wants to drive anything else then Russians. 
The Ingame T-34 needs to plant a single hit on his opponent to kill him. the British Cromwell, which frequently faces it (and for some reason, has no reverse gear) needs to plant shots into each individual crewman, because shell spalling is only a minor inconvienience, whereas explosives are teh wrath of God.
Finally, unlike WoT, the chance to bounce is not set, and is completely RNG to the point that HESH, which pancakes onto a surface, can actually bounce off an angled plate.
rating 3/10. Horrible, buggy and frustrating, not helped by devs that are more interested in pushing out content then in fixing the mode.

Now onto the devs themselves. They are bad, atleast their gamedesign is. Balance is a mess, with many over and underpowered machines sitting at ranks where they have no business to be. official response, ""balancing is done through numbers."" This has lead to the amusing situation where you had the A6M5 zero, an aircraft that has a top speed of 540kph was considered to be a balanced matchup for the P-80C shooting star, which went nearly twice as fast, had far better controls, and was supposed to go up to equivalent aircraft like the Meteor. While some of the more special ones have been removed, the point remains, there is no idea to balance it, and any suggestion about changing it is met with a resolute mocking and telling people that having biplanes facing off against B-17's is the only alternative.
In Tanks, its even worse, given that the spread is identical, which means that its not uncommon to find yourself in a position where you are outgunned and cannot do anything really, because of hte fact your gun cannot penetrate his armor from any angle. In Gaijin's view, this is considered a fair match.

"
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"There is only one word that I can say to describe this game...




Boi.



This is definetly one of my top 5 Games to play list. The realism is amazing, the physics are great, the use of the ultra-low graphic settings makes this game absolutely playable on a laptop (max fps I got for this game was 47 fps). 

Definetly get this game"
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,RUSSIAN BIAS
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"This game is very hard to advance in. No matter which tier of tanks I'm in,  at least half of the tanks are the next tier which a majority of them my tanks barely damage while they can 1 hit mine and destroy them. I was in tier 2 with 5 tanks to choose from. I was fighting tier 3 tanks the majority of the time. Finally I managed to get 3 tier 3 tanks and when I go to battle I'm fighting tier 4 tanks. There has been many times where I've hit the other tank 7 or 8 times and not crippling it. If you cant get kills you cant advance your tanks hardly at all."
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"After 1,500+ hours in this game, I can safely say this game is utter trash. This game had so much potential but was wasted on a greedy company like gaijin who cares about money more than quallity or listening to the player base. The only saving factor of it is that no one else has made a game quite like it. Once I see a competent studio release such a game I will uninstall War Thunder that instant. War Thunder has a horrible grind for new vehicles that keeps getting added to every 1-2 months with new broken vehicles. They incentivise you to pay money to reduce the grind and yet don't fix the existing problems. The company is so greedy that they will not even stop at installing practically malware on your computer ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/5j221b/gaijinnet_agent/ ) that my best guess when running in the background tracks your data and uses it to advertize even more or sell to other companies for even more of a profit. This is a game riddled with problems that the development company doesnt bother fixing because they are too busy trying to make get more money out of the users whatever way they can. i would never recommend this game in the current state even after just going out of beta stage a few months ago. The top tier gameplay is tough to get to and broken to all hell once you get there. Avoid this game if you can.

4,865 hours. game is still shit"
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,cool
War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"War Thunder offers a great multiplayer experience of WW2/CW aerial and tank warfare. It has to be mentioned that visuals, gameplay and optimization are top notch. This game also features the best damage model I´ve encountered in a game of this sort. Hits and casualties are visualized with a unique picture-in-picture feedback which is very satisfying. Realistic and simulator mode are offered for people that look for the realistic fun which is a big pro.

But if you want to experience the great fidelity WT offers but aren´t willing to tone down your graphics to Playstation 1 90s standard in order to stay ""competitive"" then expect to have a big spotting disadvantage and also prepare to get blasted trough foliage, smoke and even solid objects. I don´t like to shout ""hax!"" and I don´t know how bad or good really the cheating situation is in War Thunder but take a look at the very low vs high graphic comparsion screenshots or get a impression for yourself and you´ll understand how people are able to pull of those shots. It is great that Gaijin also gives the low spec players the ability to participate but low graphic settings should never give you an advantage. I really hope Gayjin will fix that.

Also tank simulator fans may be disappointed that the tank warfare has not much to do with real tank operations. Many maps and objective placement force you to fight in tight places where everyone tries to ambush each other which unfortunately relies on heavy use of the 3p camera and gamey map marking. While this is of course fun I find the lack of big wide battlegrounds and real tank battles very frustrating. There are some maps that offer this experience but the community tend to avoid or dislike them because it takes too much time and patience for spotting and calculating a proper fire solution. Time that people want to spent with the grinding.  

Which bringes me to a big problem. This game suffers from horrible research points and silver lions grind from Tier 4 upwards even with premium account and boosting Talisman or premium vehicles. To all normal people that aren´t willing to spent their whole live on one game, that have careers, activites, sports, and social life to attend, be ready to wait a long time or to invest really big sums of money in order to see your favorite high tier tank in your garage. 

I´m okay with F2P games that ask you for some cash in order to save you time but this game has a absurd and greedy pricing. Monetization all over the place. Yeah die hard fans will tell you the grind isn´t that bad and paying money is not needed. Strangely most top tier players I´ve met have spent 200 - 300 dollars on average on this game for talismans, ingame currency, premium accounts, and vehicles. 

The described cons sadly leaves a very bad impression and is the reason why I´m not getting in love with this game and have to give a negative rating. 

To be fair it has to mentioned that there is at least no real pay to win in this game. You can purchase backup vehicles or buy camouflage objects but this has not much of an impact. More important is the fact that you can´t equip your vehicles with some premium boosters or powerful ammunitions for real money like in other games.  

I´ll recommend you to aim for your favourite Tier 2/3 vehicles which are unlocked in a reasonable amount of time. Stay with this tiers, they´re really fun - gameplay and tank-mix wise - and stop worrying about the grind and the tier 5 but play the objective and for fun."

Kerbal Space Program,Simulation,220200,All of the perfect physics to be a space simulator (if you are a space geek this game is for you)
Kerbal Space Program,Simulation,220200,I love this game
Kerbal Space Program,Simulation,220200,"Kerbal space program is just one of those games that you come back to time and time again. What's different about it is that each time you do come back you put another 100 hours in. With its realistic physics and and easy to use building UI this game is very accessable  to most people  and the learning curve is isnt too steep. Making it to the mun for the first time is such a satisfying feat while also being a catalyst that will lead you on a path of launching a space station to the outer reaches of the kerbol system. This game will bring the best inventor out of anyone and will inspire you to build the most amazing or wacky things you can think of. This game deserves more praise than I could ever give. 

Side note: The developers of this game have created a shining example of how early access should work. From being in pre alpha all the way to consistent updates past full release this game has had nothing but love and care put into it. Squad took input from the community and implemented mods and hired on modders to make the game better. This has culminated into the best space program sim to ever exist. Thanks squad!"

Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"I've tried out a decent few factory games before, and none of them have come even remotely close to catching my interest as much as Dyson Sphere Program. Factorio, for example, is a pretty clever game, and I don't mean to knock it, but I quickly lost interest because it didn't really feel as though there was anything cool to work towards. As in, it felt like the purpose of the factory was just the factory itself. There may have been some hazy end goal, but there was nothing in between to spark my awe- just endless automation.

Dyson Sphere Program takes the creative problem-solving/logistics planning aspects of the factory game genre and just, in my humble opinion, sparks it to its fullest potential (almost- there is always room for improvement, but we'll get there). In this game, you aren't [i]just[/i] automating things to be as efficient and organized and convenient as possible- you're still doing plenty of that of course, but along the way you also get to build incredible sci-fi devices. Launching thousands of solar sails to orbit around your nearest star to gather energy for you, upgrading your mech to travel between solar systems at warp speed, building vast networks of automated drones to deliver resources between planets for you- it's not solely about the planning, there are also actual moments of cathartic, exciting payoff that come to you frequently by just being an immensely cool game on a conceptual level.

If you are new to the genre (I am relatively new considering I gave up on others before overcoming their main hurdles), this game will be challenging to approach. I distinctly remember a point about six or so hours in where I [i]almost[/i] gave up and quit because I felt like there was just too much stuff to figure out at once and I didn't know my next step and I just had no idea where to go next. But I stuck it out and just started researching the coolest looking thing, and the next day (a weekend) ten hours went by of me playing and hardly noticing. So basically what you should take from this is that you should go into this game with the determination to overcome a steep learning curve, or just recognize that it's probably not your cup of tea.

Now, the negatives. I personally find space travel annoying and stressful. Being trapped in space, drifting into an infinite void with no hope in sight, scares me on a deep psychological level, so when I have to travel between planets with nothing but a finite tank of fuel and the possibility that I might accidentally miss my target and be slingshotted around its orbit into vast darkness, the rational part of my brain tells me I can just load a save, but the ape part of my brain is annoyed that my management game is now a horror game. I'd like a technology in the research tree that can shuttle the player automatically between planets, mostly for my own sanity.

The second thing is mostly a Early Access-type thing that I'm sure will be improved on in the future- I want more endgame tech to exist, like the ability to destroy entire planets to gain all their resources in one fell swoop, or create wormholes for instant teleportation between points in space, or create entire planet-sized space stations (yeah 2/3 of those suggestions is just describing the Death Star, deal with it); things like that which actually require access to the immense energy of a Dyson Sphere will add a ton more spice to the game (which of course already has plenty, but there can never be too much).

The final thing is actually something that is not in the game yet but will be- please don't add combat. I know I'm probably in the minority here but the game is complex enough without that on top of it. Maybe as like, a rare event in specific locations it would be fine but for it to be a constant nuisance that threatens to destroy parts of one's factory at any moment is just too annoying to even think about.

All in all, game looks visually incredible, haven't noticed a single substantial bug, very complex and interesting to play. If the idea of creating vast automatic factories that can create anything you want on a whim and can span multiple planets, with the goal of turning entire stars into your own personal generator intrigues you, I highly recommend giving this a try."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"I have over 300 hours in this game, often playing it all day long. It's never crashed. It's never glitched out or corrupted my save game. I'm at the point where I've completed a Dyson Sphere and it's never dropped a frame despite multiple planets literally covered in production lines. Dyson Sphere Program  looks absolutely beautiful.

And it's in early access.

This game is a masterpiece of coding."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,Horribly addicting.  Love It.
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"""Oh, it's already 4 a.m."" Haven't had that in a while.

This game is a nice rabbithole of designing, optimizing and automating your acutal task of building spheres around stars. 
An important feature for me: This game does not rush you to do anything and you can completely play at your own pace. Fixing bottlenecks is a big part of this game, but they don't punish you in form of ""throwbacks"". Stuff just moves slower until you are ready for stuff to move faster. I guess this is what it would feel like, If life adjusted its speed to you.

Despite it's Early Access status, I'm not missing much, except for some minor QoL and insight into resource-production in the stats-page. And even those are in the works."

Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,Factorio-style gameplay with 3D (for conveyor belts) and with multiple planets. What's not to love?
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"  I've always had a fascination with astronomy, engineering and physics but this took it to a new level. The idea of a dyson sphere was always one of the most alluring concepts to me as far as future tech was concerned. To live in a day and age where a society can collaborate so perfectly that it could create such a structure felt like a dream to me, but this game gave me a window into that dream. To be able to exist in world where even hypothetically, as a collective we can create a theoretical concept for the future, regardless of whether humanity will ever get there, it gives me a little hope for a possible future. 

  I never played games like this before. Builders and factory games were never something that even crossed my path, let one drew me in. But this game opened doors for me; gave me ideas. Plus the concept of being a lone individual with such a God like power to shape your part of the universe, carving out planets and owning stars, while you contribute to the whole of the galaxy along side other engineers in their own cluster is a very empowering idea.

  The gameplay mechanics are phenomenal. The limitless possibilities of factoring in resources from planets across multiple star systems. Planning to create massive structures with nigh infinite power at your disposal. Harnessing the power of the sun itself in the palm of your hands, then exploring further to touch another. 

  This game has so much potential and it's still only in early access. If you have a head for a game like this, or if you are looking to try something new it's definitely worth the inexpensive price tag. I dont think I've gotten this much out of many games for a very long time. I definitely think Freeman would be proud to know that his vision came to something of a realization so close to his lifetime."

Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"I've put in a ridiculous number of hours on this game since I purchased it a month ago and have restarted 3 times as I learned more about the mechanics.  I'm now about to begin my fourth restart with the release of the May update.  I don't think I could say enough about the beauty, depth and overall immersive nature of this game.  The graphics are stunning...standing on a distant planet, watching drones, interplanetary vehicles and  celestial objects all in motion at once while my solar sail projectors create a ring of sails around the local sun...just incredible!  So excited to start my next play-though and really scale this thing out...btw...that's the secret to this game.  Think strategically, but think really, really BIG!"
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"This game is stunning. Everything is so well done. My only criticism is that there is so much they dont tell you. Little things that make such a big difference. This game needs a real tutorial mode to help teach new players. I am 60 hours in and still learning basic things. That said, I love it! I cant wait to see what they stuff into this game in the coming months."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"This is the game I hoped Satisfactory would be: a 3-D version of Factorio. Plus you get to expand on an interplanetary and even interstellar basis. Very cool.

Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"WARNING! Do NOT buy this game if you ever want to see the sun again or get some sleep. Because once you start, the hours just fly by without you noticing."
Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"Let me compare this game to Factorio from my, subjective perspective.

While I always loved the concept of Factorio I never played it for long because it had a few critical flaws in my eyes: it was ugly, every run looked basically the same, it had no real goal at the end and - the worst - it wasn't rewarding - by that I mean you don't get cool things (with exception of drones, car and maybe weapons if you care to deal with critters), just more things to manage with even more complicated and tedious logistic management. I was always getting bored very fast and moved on to do something different.

Now, is Dyson Sphere Project better than factorio?

I think it is, at least for most cases. While there are no enemies, I don't think it is inferior to Factorio in this case - no fighting is better than bad fighting. 
The most important thing for me is that the game just feels more like it respect your time and enjoyment. You get constrution drones with big radius from the very start - if you want to make a conveor belt over the continent, you just need to designate start and end and then wait some time for your drones do to it. For smaller projects it's barely noticeable.
Finally, there are some goals you can actually see there - if you get this technology, you will be able to fly from star to star. How cool is that? This is something for which I am willing to play the game to get it. Of course it might not be enough for everyone but for me, it certainly is.

To conclude, do I recommend the game in current state? Yes. Do I think you should pay the full price for it? If you are like me, an engineering student with strong interest astronomy, yes. If not, wait some time."

Farming Simulator 19,Simulation,787860,"This is third Farming Simulator version I have bought (also 15 and 17).  I have grown to like this one more than the earlier ones.  It brings back memories of my grandparents working their farm, though without all the equipment (they used a mule). One of my grandfathers eventually bought a Ford tractor, the other bought an International Harvester.  I can remember him tying a wooden pallet to the back of the tractor and pulling two of my cousins and I around the farm, which we thought was awesome.  If you have any interest in farming, business management, or simulating the long hours of often back breaking but rewarding work a farmer does, this is the game for you. You also will not find a game much better supported by modders than this one.  The only thing it is missing is the farmer's wife bringing a pitcher of cold lemonade to him in the field."

Farming Simulator 19,Simulation,787860,I played 250+ hours on FS19. I found it really easy to add mods and host servers for mates. The game was very easy to adapt to controller wise and machine wise. The only issue i/we had was graphics. The game lacked on FPS at most times when around 4 people were on the server. Even with farms being on complete opposite sides of the maps we still had major FPS loss and lag. Minus the FPS issue the game was pretty fun. It can get repetitive here and there but mods can help. Overall i give it a 7/10 game-play wise and a 5/10 graphic/FPS

7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"With the amount of improvements this game has seen over the last few years, I can say this is quite enjoyable.

If you're looking for a ""new"" game to play with friends, this might do the trick. Easy to invest many hours into."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"I cannot recommend this game. It's been 8 years, released 2013, it is now 2021. I'll give it some credit that it has gone through some graphical change, and some features were added...

But I don't recommend it because...

I used to mod and write codes for this game, but every other year they would change it and everything will go to hell, or you lose your world's data. And this kept happening. In about 2018, I stopped playing it and so did my community because our beautiful and largely created world that we stayed on for 4 years (This game is like minecraft) had finally failed.

We had a underground tunnel network to go from one major city to another. We had a pvp arena and everything. A large underground Hive similiar to Resident Evil (The movie). We had a death pit where people could stay on horde night (Every 7 days). We made gigantic fortified skyscrapers, all kinds of things. Custom mods (That we made ourselves) with our small team of devs, and more.

We even had ingame faction npcs and players (You register to a faction, and if you were killed you'd drop your factions coin that an enemy faction could turn in for exclusive loot via reputation in your own faction).

We even made respawns for loot, trees, and other resources- so that we would have indefinite resources in the world (Example, respawning boulders that would give you little bit of everything, cars that would self-respawn, etc)."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Was waiting for over 10 minutes to create a world, 5 minutes to connect and after connection the game crushed.
10/10 would wait again"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"It's somewhat ironic, that a group of developers that call themselves ""The Fun Pimps"" have taken it upon themselves to create a game that is as devoid of fun as the landscapes are barren in their game. As I write this review, the game is on sale at £5.69 GPB (normal price £18.99 GBP). Would I recommend it at the same price, unlikely. The full asking price? Absolutely not. Don't bother. It's only interesting for a couple of days, then you realise it's the same old, tired, (and at this point 8 YEAR) formula over and over. The devs have made their fortune, and now they are content coasting by on it, with no real motivation or drive to push out any meaningful, fun, innovative content. The latest slap in the face? So-called ""Twitch integration"" that no-one wants, let alone needs. It's Early Access, Alpha 20. Twenty incremental updates spanning 8 years. The ""Road Map"" of new features and content? They removed it because they weren't delivering on it, so it was easier to just not commit to anything. And don't you dare mention the road map or lack of updates in the forum, because if the devs don't ban you, the mods will, because they are oh-so-touchy and can't handle the critisim that is directed towards this game from so many people. The environments are static, never changing. Optimisation is non existent (but again, don't you dare mention this in the forums!). I was even told outright by a dev in the forum it was REASONABLE to wait in excess of 33 minutes for a map to load on my rig which is an i9-9900k, 2080ti, 64GB ram, nvme m.2 drive. Crazy. It's 2021, you should be expecting more from the games you play, don't settle for less, and certainly not at a whopping £18.99 GBP, you can get better games with better graphics, that are more fun to play, don't suffer extreme FPS drops when multiple enemies spawn on screen etc...This is a sand-box of a game, where you play the same formula over and over, the only difference is a cat has soiled in this sand box before you even begin."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"This game is mediocre at best...

I used to be on Xbox a few years ago and had 7 Days To Die and rebought it a week ago. Literally haven't noticed a single difference aside from new items and a shop (which teleports you in front of zombies if you go near it at night). 
Starting off is horrible for the simple fact that melee in this game is SO BAD, so enjoy walking around with broken bones for the first few days and low health because of it. Movement feels so slow as well and you can't drive 95% of the vehicles you come across. 

Building in this game is extremely mundane and takes forever to gather resources. Unlike other survival games, you actually have to gather twice as much materials to build because you have to place a frame and then upgrade the frame to get a tile (what is this, 2013?) oh wait, that's right this game HAS been in alpha since 2013 which is quite sad. Developers are extremely slow at updating this game as well. I hope you like horrible graphics that'll never get updated because this game looks exactly the same as it did when I played on Xbox One in 2013. Don't let the screenshots fool you either, watch youtube gameplay of this game and you'll see exactly what I mean. This game is laggy for some reason too even though I run a 1660 TI, i7 9th gen, 32 gb Ram, SSD. 

If you're looking for a zombie experience, LOOK ELSEWHERE. Left 4 Dead is a way better option than this piece of sh*t. I thought I'd give this game another try but was quickly reminded how bad this was. This is a dollar tree version of Ark but with zombies (Ark released way after this game too which is even more sad for 7DTD). I should've bought Days Gone instead. I don't think I'll bother trying to progress in this game until I decide to grind for achievements. 

TLDR; Mediocre game with 2013 graphics and gameplay, everything looks the same from 2013, melee combat sucks, feels way too tedious to progress any further. Probably won't update this review until I decide to go for all the achievements which will be the last thing I do in my library."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"I followed the name of the game and my first death was on the seventh day. my friend however died many times prior.

very good game if you like to sink a good bit of time into survival and gathering. Easily one of the best zombie survival games I have ever played."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"For a game in Early Access, this is pretty great! Not only is this the best zombie survival game ever, but the way you can configure the game is amazing. Want a game without a blood moon? click a button. Want easier or harder zombies? Click a button. Want longer or shorter days? Click a button. The game is so configurable that the game can be configured any way you want. And once you start the game, you can reconfigure it anytime you want. Game getting too easy? Click a button. Getting too hard, click a button. You can tailor the game any way you want it. Not just the way they created it. 

And to top it all off, they are not done! There have been other games (like Empyrion) that will tell you they are still adding to the game and never do. When this game get's an update, it GET'S AN UPDATE! I bought this game now because the next update A20 is coming out soon. And when it does, it will be like playing a whole new game again...

Definitely worth the money!"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Best zombie game out there as of now, i say as of now because i am in hope that someone will surpass them. This game has everything you would want in a survival zombie game and a good community to boot. Many servers active still and some good mod devs out there making the game ever more fun than before. Well worth the buy."
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Absolutely love this game! I've been playing since Alpha 16, about 2 years ago, with my friends and re-visited it again recently. I have to give props for the zombie appearances being remodeled and new items added :). If you love base building, a post-apocalyptic setting, zombies running around and chasing after you, and an open-world where you loot and gather resources, this is the game for you. 

My one and only issue, and I'm guessing this may have been raised by others, is that it is somewhat buggy and lags from time to time and I'm sure given that it is still in it's Alpha phase - for many years now xD - it will get better. Looking forward to future updates and hope this games continues to stay solid and deliver amazing content and game play with every new patch update!"

7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Day: Call me Daryl Dixon. How many walkers have you killed?
Night: Shhhhhhh, sir this is a library!"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"on of the best, needs some work on graphics tho not everyone has a 2.000 rig to run it, even on low im having tons of fun"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,Really fun for solo or with friends
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"first off this game is not likely to be released in full, its been in alpha for years but that doesn't make it a bad game, on the contrary its a great game, i have 400 hours in it and haven't gotten bored yet, its constantly being updated and every so often its given a big update that refreshes everything, i was unfortunate enough to be a console player and eventually when i picked this up on pc the difference was night and day! if you get into this game and your a mature player looking for a great game to play with friends that doesn't involve some 15 year old cod lunatic calling you a multitude of insults then this is a game you can enjoy!"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,A good survival crafting game with a bit of a learning curve. It is a good idea to run from zombies if you are just starting out.
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,they wildin tbh

If you love base building, a post-apocalyptic setting, zombies running around and chasing after you, and an open-world where you loot and gather resources, this is the game for you. 

My one and only issue, and I'm guessing this may have been raised by others, is that it is somewhat buggy and lags from time to time and I'm sure given that it is still in it's Alpha phase - for many years now xD - it will get better. Looking forward to future updates and hope this games continues to stay solid and deliver amazing content and game play with every new patch update!"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,YO THERE WAS A WOLF AND MY FRIENDS AND I DIED
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"Day: Call me Daryl Dixon. How many walkers have you killed?
Night: Shhhhhhh, sir this is a library!"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"on of the best, needs some work on graphics tho not everyone has a 2.000 rig to run it, even on low im having tons of fun"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,Really fun for solo or with friends
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,"first off this game is not likely to be released in full, its been in alpha for years but that doesn't make it a bad game, on the contrary its a great game, i have 400 hours in it and haven't gotten bored yet, its constantly being updated and every so often its given a big update that refreshes everything, i was unfortunate enough to be a console player and eventually when i picked this up on pc the difference was night and day! if you get into this game and your a mature player looking for a great game to play with friends that doesn't involve some 15 year old cod lunatic calling you a multitude of insults then this is a game you can enjoy!"
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,A good survival crafting game with a bit of a learning curve. It is a good idea to run from zombies if you are just starting out.
7 Days to Die,Strategy,251570,they wildin tbh

Stellaris,Strategy,281990,Gud game. But you need to buy some DLC to make it really playable so that's kinda shit.
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,The fact that they took out existing functionality of federations and then put it back in as a DLC is a good example of how paradox has lost it's way.
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,it is ok
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"The game was once really good. At version 1.9 or so. But then they decided to rework the whole population and resource system which totally breaks the game. soon after start the game slows down coz even a strong pc cant keep up all the unessesary calculations anymore. so at mid game, on a medium sized map the game becomes totally unplayable because all you do is wait and wait and wait. yes you can set the game speed to max. but the game will always be just as fast as the calculations are done. 

Multiplayer is also not advised. 1. most servers are empty, coz nobody plays it so broken and when you find a server without a password, the game is only running on normal speed at best. So sending a research ship to the next solarsystem feels like realtime. 

Very poor from paradox that they continue to fuck the game up and push out addons that are not even half finished.

Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"I have spent a stupid amount of time playing Stellaris. Coincidental catastrophes---like Awakening Empires at the same time as the Grey Tide is released and extra-dimensional horrors show up---are a great challenge to try & survive (which I didn't in that particular case...) If you love 4X games, you'll love Stellaris."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,My wallet is sad but this game is one of the most creative takes on a strategy game that I have ever seen
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Great game, It has infuriating learning curves that require you to look up online how stuff works because it does the WORST job explaining it. Some things don't even do what they literally say they do. Pretty buggy. And the worst part is that half the game is behind 150$+ WALL OF DLC'S wich is the worst most irremediable way to put a game out. So too bad about the company. But fun game otherwise."
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Glad there's finally a game for me to vent all my genocidal frustration. I was getting bored of starting cultural-conflicts between the ants that reside in the broken pipeline underneath my basement. Thanks for the cool game, I will reference such a product in my upcoming radical manifesto."

Stellaris,Strategy,281990,The best 4X on the market for my money.
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Very good sci-fi 4X/RTS game overall. However, keep in mind that this is a Paradox Interactive game so you will need to spend at least $100 on DLC in order to get fun out of it. Thankfully most of the DLC will go on sale sometimes either on Steam (or Humble Bundle which is even better) and you can get it for real cheap. 

To make this game playable you will absolutely need most of the DLCs, it is incredibly bland and genuinely unplayable without them. However,  if you have the money to buy this game I'd say its worth it on sale. "
Stellaris,Strategy,281990,"Newbie here.  The Vanilla game works great.  Now, I just have to wait for ST New Horizons to update and I'll be off at warp speed!  I'll be gaming Stellaris for quite some time to come.  Thank you Paradox for making a great game."

Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,best combat simulation VR experience period.
Blade and Sorcery,Simulation,629730,"im a big fan of directional combat in medieval games, i will play even the most glitchy and euro-jank ones that i find for hundreds of hours, if a game has directional combat i will give it a go even if its anime styled, its my favorite thing in pc games.

i have been following the development of VR headsets since CCP games got in to it and developed for oculus(eve valkyre rip), its been awhile but i never had the urge to try it out, always seen it as a fad and tbh i dont think VR ever made that leap to become mainstream, it was too expensive and murky to invest a lot of money in, that was before quest 2 tho, now its cheap as hell but i digress, 

after i have seen a youtube video of blade and sorcery(thank you for the content baron), i decided that its time to grab a VR headset, i do not remember when was the last time i spent this much effort and money just to play 1 game spesifically, there are many other good games in the market but blade and sorcery is what got me in to vr,

the videos i watched on my flatscreen tv does not give it justice, i knew it was gonna be good but i never understood how amazing its gonna be, yeah the AI could use some work and there is some jank involved but i feel like i am now old enough to look past the shortcomings of games, there is room for improvement but for me personally it is everything i wanted the good old directional combat to become, the physics are amazing, fighting 5 npcs all at once is the best shit ever, there is this really good mod on nexus that adds a lot of medieval weapons, i really cant get enough of this game.

your mileage may vary but if you are a medieval era junkie like i am, this game offers some good stuff, if you are from mount and blade crowd i highly recommend blade and sorcery, this is all i can ask for from a game and looking at the roadmap i see how its gonna get better and better in time, its insane that 1 developer made this game, amazing work."

There are swords, shields, bows, spears, hammers, maces, etc and you can even mod in more weapons light lightsabers or guns. The maps are small but well done, and just big enough. I wish there was a way to customize your own Wave scenario like a slider system for each enemy type or the max amount you fight at once can be, instead of using just the presets. Very fun game.

Looked online and tried everything. Restarted the game, my laptop, reinstalled the game, verified file integrity, and even did what was suggested to fix this specific issue, going into the files and making sure under height that callibrated = true which it already was. A real shame so i returned the game.

"Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades",Simulation,450540,"This and Blade and Sorcery are the top two VR games out there in my opinion, and they each cover two ends of the weapons spectrum; firearms and melee combat. Then there's Boneworks which strikes a nice middle ground between the two but makes sacrifices in other areas. And lastly we have Half Life Alyx which ignores the gameplay aspects and focuses instead on story and graphics - a good intro to VR but disappointing for people who have experienced any of the aforementioned games.

Get this game if you like guns and/or if you like rogue-lites. The Take and Hold mode provides the most replayable gameplay for most people; you start with a gun and melee weapon then proceed to capture ""uplinks"" (defending them from a few waves of enemies) then use the points gained from the uplink to purchase more guns, attachments, grenades etc. There are sub-modes (called Characters) to spice things up, such as a Wild West weapon pool, an entire Half Life recreation complete with head crabs, zombies, Combine and Half Life weapons, and more.

There are also the firing ranges and sandbox maps you've undoubtedly seen, and mods can expand the gameplay a lot more, including more maps for Take and Hold, more weapons, weapon skins, modular weapons such as an M4 or AK platform."

"Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades",Simulation,450540,"At first glance, you might be forgiven for thinking that a sandbox game with no multiplayer and no single player storyline was riding purely off the back of the novelty of VR, perhaps there is some justification in that, but even so, if you have VR and you like shooting things this is an essential purchase. 

It has the widest array of guns available in any VR app, most of which are modelled on real firearms, including extremely rare ones like the cancelled British EM2 rifle that *almost* became Britain's standard infantry rifle replacing the Lee Enfield in the 1950s. 

The emphasis is on realism and realistic physics, and it was perhaps understandable on some level that the developers wanted to avoid too much controversy and keep it family friendly by limiting the targets to inanimate objects and animatronic 'hot dogs'. Probably not the most exciting VR game out there, but as a pure gun simulator it is unmatched. Each firearm has to be handled in the same way as its real life counterpart, whether it is a belt-fed machine gun, a muzzle loading pistol or a magazine loaded AK47. If you are familiar with the firearm in real life you will already know how to load the magazine and where the charging handle is to make it ready for firing, if you aren't, you may have to fiddle around working it out for yourself, the instructions aren't always perfect. It isn't usually that hard to figure out if you have a basic understanding of how guns work although it did take me a while to work out how to load the belt-fed GPMG having never done so in real life. 

If you are interested in guns and live, like myself, in a country like the UK where owning and handling guns is very restricted this is an essential purchase. Even if you are an American gun nut living in Texas and have few restrictions other than your wallet there is still something to be had in this game, many of the guns like the EM2 are very rare and unless you are well connected with people who have custody of these firearms this is as close as you are ever going to get to getting to fire one."
"Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades",Simulation,450540,"Easily my favourite VR game. I legitimately think I might of sold my headset on if not for this game. Robust weapon simulation, enjoyable gamemodes, and a plethora of content with no endpoint in sight means it's probably only a matter of time before I surpass 100 hours.

If a lack of multiplayer isn't a bother for you, and you're one of those weird people who like playing games by themselves, I'd highly recommend this. It's the best shooter available, just unfortunately not multiplayer."

"Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades",Simulation,450540,mmmm hotdog yumy
"Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades",Simulation,450540,"This and Blade and Sorcery are the top two VR games out there in my opinion, and they each cover two ends of the weapons spectrum; firearms and melee combat. Then there's Boneworks which strikes a nice middle ground between the two but makes sacrifices in other areas. And lastly we have Half Life Alyx which ignores the gameplay aspects and focuses instead on story and graphics - a good intro to VR but disappointing for people who have experienced any of the aforementioned games.

Get this game if you like guns and/or if you like rogue-lites. The Take and Hold mode provides the most replayable gameplay for most people; you start with a gun and melee weapon then proceed to capture ""uplinks"" (defending them from a few waves of enemies) then use the points gained from the uplink to purchase more guns, attachments, grenades etc. There are sub-modes (called Characters) to spice things up, such as a Wild West weapon pool, an entire Half Life recreation complete with head crabs, zombies, Combine and Half Life weapons, and more.

There are also the firing ranges and sandbox maps you've undoubtedly seen, and mods can expand the gameplay a lot more, including more maps for Take and Hold, more weapons, weapon skins, modular weapons such as an M4 or AK platform."

Even if you find just shooting guns on a range boring (Which I doubt you will), you can load up take and hold to experience a first person shooter in a way you've never done before.

Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"It's a very faithful successor to Theme Hospital and carries the same brilliant sense of humour, if you enjoyed Theme Hospital in any way you'll like this. In my opinion a few things could be more balanced (queue management takes a lot of time for example!) but overall it's a great game."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"Two Point Hospital isn't such a simulation game like the most others. In fact it's far away from showing the reality but that is what the game makes special and lovely!
It includes [u] a lot [/u] of sarcasm and humorism in general. The diseases/illnesses the patient have follow this line and are therefore more funny than anything of realistic. I mean we're speaking from illnesses like Cubism, Floppy Discs, Grey Anatomy, Jazz Hand, Premature Mummification, Cauliflower Ears, Flat-Packed etc...
And really, it makes so much fun to discover all these different diseases and everytime you experience something new you have to laugh because it's always connected with a funny anecdote.
And in general it has to be said that Two Point Hospital has such a lot of lovely details in it which makes the game only even more great. With that I mean for example the loudspeaker announcements- this woman is so funny with the little things she tells and you often have to smile about it, the same goes with the announcements trough the radio. And the stil of the graphic fits also perfectly!
And even if you only have the main game without any DLC, you can spend a lot of time in that game! I spent round about 100 hours only in the main game, because I had a lot of fun to collect all possible stars for every different hospital- it gets never boring!
I can also tell that the DLC are worth it too because there is also so many new things to discover, new diseases, new hospitals, new challenges, new landscapes etc... 

I don't say that often, but I have no negative aspect about that game, I'm just really happy with it!"
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,Awesome Hospital Simulation with fantastic animation and great voice overs. The price point is rather steep on this one so I strongly suggest purchasing while on sale. Enjoy
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,addictive like drug
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"Mechanically it works fine, but it just doesn't have the ""it"" factor that would keep me playing.  It seems like I just plop down a few rooms, hire a few guys, and click the fast forward button until something happens.  Who knows, maybe it gets better with all the DLC, though I doubt it, since I've heard all they add is new hospitals with new diseases.  Don't get me wrong, the graphics are cute, and I like the diseases themselves, it's all just a bit boring."
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"It is pretty good.  I found it good enough to continue to purchase updates as they came out.  Each update added a new layer to the insanity of the game.  I would recommend it to anyone, just don't expect it to be a serious game."

Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,no lizard but ok
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"Where to start!

Pros,

Theme hospital was one of the greatest games ever made, this just came along and matched it.
High amounts of content and hospitals, more than it looks when you first buy it.
Hilarious dialogue and treatments.
Awesome amount of freedom and control over what you do to a certain extent.
Perfect for anyone who has an OCD for micromanaging.
Graphically extremely relaxing and pleasing.
The best of British humour.

Cons,

Learning curve is brutal compared to the first game.
Micro controls can be frustrating.
An awful lot to remember in the later levels.
RNG based staff recruiting system which can be annoying and cause a few resets.
Some form of co-op mode would be awesome.

Not really much else to say, props to Sega for bringing back this perfection and actually not messing it up!"

Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,cool
Two Point Hospital,Simulation,535930,"kinda boring after a while because the challenges are not too difficult. 

once i left the game play by itself for an hour and found that there are hectic queue on all my GPs and Pschiatry, garbage all over the hospital, and staff happiness is below 29. and then by mistakes i lower my prices too low that made the hospital almost shutdown because the deficit budget is almost 150 thousands. however, after a while it got solved. i just randomly add more GP rooms, hire more doctors, hire more janitors, hire more nurses, increased the price again and maintaining the queue. that is the most challenging moment that ever happened in last 10 hours of my playtime.

so, i do not recommend the game to player who are seeking difficult challenge from a game."

Goat Simulator,Simulation,265930,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,"While almost certainly worth its on-sale price at 75% off, I can't bring myself to recommend it to [b]players like me[/b], i.e. someone who is looking for a theme park management game a la Rollercoaster Tycoon.

What it [/b]is[/b] is a clean and well presenting sandbox theme park designer game great for if you really want to get into the realm of deep customization of (some kinds of) rides and (some kinds of) attractions. The coaster editor is, luckily, very exhaustive and well thought out. Ultimately though, even after the full research of the tech tree there aren't all that many kinds of different options for other kinds of rides and themes though. Load a sandbox game one time and you'll instantly see all of the available rides/attractions in the base game and all of the wonder or intrigue of unlocking things in the future will be gone (here's where they get you by stimulating the purchase of DLCs I suspect).

So what it is [b]NOT[/b], though, is a well thought out park management sim. If that's what you're looking for (a successor to Rollercoaster Tycoon) Planet Coaster is not it. 

While it seems to have spent a lot of time perfecting its look and feel, the mechanics behind the game seem shallow or lacking, from the personnel management to the tech research to the actual physical park layout designing. Gaining or losing profit are just a matter of pulling the right levers and executing the right sequence of moves (set the right prices, build the right number of stands, hire the right number of employees, etc.) and then waiting to see if you're in the green or the red with little to no variation or randomness. While it's easier to be ""creative"" on the design side, there's not much room for ""creativity"" on the management side.

Oddly enough, a weird complaint I have is that there doesn't seem to be any kind of ""standard game"" where the concept is just to build a park from the ground up and survive/thrive. There are the campaigns, which aren't free form and feel more like I'm managing someone else's park in the image they'd like (which quite literally is the premise of them) and will randomly limit things like landscaping and personnel management which is sort of weird. Or there are the challenge modes that just have various tiered objectives that may or may not be what you're interested in doing/focusing on. The sandbox gives unlimited money so that hardly qualifies as a challenge. 

Ultimately Planet Coaster seems like a fine game for some people that might be looking for a specific thing, but much to my chagrin (and the chagrin of my 12 bucks) I'm not one of those people so it didn't grab me, and therefore I can't recommend it."
Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,"This game really scratches my creative itch. I've always been a huge fan of building games and management sims, and I was really into Roller Coaster Tycoon as a kid, so this game hits that perfect spot. 

I can lose an entire day just developing themed areas and even watching my little visitors experience the park from their perspective. And the amount of detail this game allows me to alter, from the terrain, to rides, to creating my own buildings, to staff and park management, to building some of the most ridiculous structures I can imagine, really makes me feel like there's always something new for me to try.

I really love that I can upload my own creations and download creations from other users. And wow, the INCREDIBLE coasters I've seen some people make that take up whole parks... it's mind blowing. 

I used to love playing all kinds of park management sims, but honestly this one has spoiled me. Nothing else even comes close to the level of freedom in this game, and it's made even better that getting creative is actively encouraged in the gameplay.

I love this game lol"

They could have focused more on optimizing their games.
I'm using a Ryzen 9 3900x
A Radeon RX 580 Pulse
And I have 16 gb of ram.
The game hits 60 FPS on medium settings but if there are more than 4000 guests in the park the fps drops down to 20-30FPS unbelievable...
I hope you guys are going to put more effort in optimizing Planet Coaster 2 or just be friendly and patch the game!
And also the game needs more flat rides if possible. There are a lot of rides that I'm missing.
One of my first games that I got from you guys (Frontier) was Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 
I spent thousands of hours in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and really enjoyed it as a kid. I love this company from the bottom of my heart but now I have to be honest and tell you I’m disappointed and sad that my girlfriend and I had to spend so much money on new computer parts to make the game run well on medium graphics."

Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,It is very hard to understand the mechanics of the game in the beginning. But it is still a great game besides that.
Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,"Very good graphics and excellent for sandbox mode building but if you're interested in the park management side of things, construction is painful and the management side of the game is not very deep. I wouldn't purchase this again, and am comfortable that the ancient Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 + expansions is an easier game to play (albeit without bells and whistles), and isn't as far behind in the management side as it should be compared to a game made 15 years later, and with half a dozen DLCs available."
Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,"This game isnt really what i was expecting or anticipating. there are no in-game tutorials, and from what i understand only the console version has those, meaning I have to go through youtube to watch a video while then trying to follow along to learn. Plus from what controls i did slowly learn how to use, placing things in a layout just felt very disorganized as some things want to snap in place, and/or require specific space to be placed without showing you what that required space actually is. 

The campaign mode itself is barely a campaign and is in my opinion just the same thing as their challenge mode. There is also no real progression to the game either as you are just plopped in with access to everything making the learning curve just ridiculously steep. I was hoping this was going to be similar to the old Roller coaster tycoon games as that's how its advertised and compared online but it really failed to meet that expectation to me."

Planet Coaster,Simulation,493340,Its a really fun game and you can do pretty much anything
theHunter: Call of the Wild™,Simulation,518790,"So. I'll start off by saying that this game is tons of fun. I really enjoy the thrill of getting a good shot off on your targeted game and the reports that judge you on how ethical your kill was. I love all of the aspects to this game that attempts to get close to a real hunt. What i don't like is the paywall to access features that should, in my opinion, be included in a hunting simulator. Having to buy DLC to have access to more weapons, tents, ATV, more reserves, more species, and hunting resorts really makes me not want to play it past the hours i already have in. Well over 70% of this game seems to be hidden behind a paywall. I broke down and bough the ATV DLC because it's absurd to sink 10-20 minutes in walking multiple km to discover fast travel points or arrive at favored hunting spots. I just can't bring myself to pay for the rest of the game. 

""TheHunter: Call of the DLC"" was a cool game seemingly ruined by micro transactions."
theHunter: Call of the Wild™,Simulation,518790,"Very realistic hunting game. It can get boring if you play the game wrong, just running for hours to kill 1 or 2 animals. Playing the game correct is the key to getting kills. Camping feeding zones, drinking zones and sleep zones. DLC's are pretty cracka and the camp towers help alot. Playing with mates can be pretty fun at times. Graphics are pretty good overall 7/10"

theHunter: Call of the Wild™,Simulation,518790,"One of the best Hunting games out there. TruRacs really makes you hunt unique antlers. 
You never know what awaits you round the tree. AN award winning Deer? Or a hungry lion?
Furthermore the Devs still update this. Sometimes there are Bugs, but they get adressed. So be patient.
They do listen A LOT to us, the comunity. This is why I can only recommend this game. 
(I am a IRL Hunter, and I personally think its a good mix between hunting and arcade hunting, realism and gamerealism. )

theHunter: Call of the Wild™,Simulation,518790,no dog balls
theHunter: Call of the Wild™,Simulation,518790,"Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful.

I have been playing since is it launched and will continue to play for as long as the developers support it. The game is great and the atmosphere and sound alone makes this game worth its price, they truly mastered what it feels like to walk around in a forest, which is almost the most important part, since you will spend 95% of your time in this game either walking around or lie in a bush waiting for prey to get close enough."
theHunter: Call of the Wild™,Simulation,518790,"I found this product completely by chance, never been hunting in my life. I don't know what it is about this game that is compelling and relaxing at the same time, but I highly recommend it (especially when it's on sale).

DLCs are optional but if you have to get one get the one that gives you access to the African map."
theHunter: Call of the Wild™,Simulation,518790,Probably the most detailed and the ''best'' hunting experience on the market.
theHunter: Call of the Wild™,Simulation,518790,"If you enjoy a frustrating experience that will crash your computer in various ways, and make you regret living, this is it. Just had a save file corruption after sinking in 51 hours. Thankfully it only seemed to wipe out my outpost and lookout tower locations. This game even caused a power kernel 41 error, which restarted my computer without warning while tracking A legendary bear. This was the last thing before corrupting my game. Fixes online don't fix the corrupted save and different session-ruining bugs from 2019 have not been addressed. The game is addicting and I will probably keep playing it myself, but altogether too frustrating to recommend to people. When you aren't experiencing bugs, the game is pretty great.
One important note: playing this with friends does make the game a lot more enjoyable."
theHunter: Call of the Wild™,Simulation,518790,"Actually the game is good but, you have to pay more for the DLC. You can't buy another bundle if you own a game. I am forced to buy every DLC separately just because I own a base game."

theHunter: Call of the Wild™,Simulation,518790,"HUGE CAVEATS for this game. If the base game is on discount at like $4, sure, have a go at it and see if you want to invest more money into the DLCs.

But too much of the game is buried under DLCs. And it would have been fine, EXCEPT they shove the fact you do not have DLCs every chance they get in-game. The DLC features are not hidden if you don't own them, like all other games with DLCs. Except they are visible with no indication they are DLCs in-game. So when you click on the features, they tell you you do not own the required DLC.

The most egregious is the ATV/quad DLC. The movement speed in this game is crazy slow. If you want to move from one area to another, you can fast travel using outposts, but you have to hoof it all the rest of the way. So you either pay for it or waste hours of your time just slowly running from one location to another. The dev even has the cheek to show an ATV screenshot in the base game. Just get a cheat to increase your movement speed.

Having things like new maps/reserves, animals, weapons and DLC are all fine IMO, but hiding quality of life features like ATVs and Tents are just too much. You just know the devs are purposely frustrating players so that they give in and buy these DLCs"

Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,if u like crack then football manager is for u
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"I finally upgraded to FM21 after skipping FM19 & 20 - mostly it was the xG feature that piqued my interest, but I also like to update every so often for little things like competition rule/qualification changes, refreshing rosters, etc. Coming from FM18, I've been pleasantly surprised at some of the new features added in FM21 - not only do I really enjoy the xG thing, I love the overall improvement in what I'd call ""realism"": The interaction with staff continues to get better and better, the way staff and management present you with reports and call meetings is awesome, and the scouting meetings before transfer windows are so damn cool. It all combines to make you feel like you're actually a manager and not just playing a game. I'm at around 230 hours of FM21 and I'm still constantly finding myself engaging with new things. 

Last, I'd just like to share my experience/thoughts on scum-saving. For the most part during my thousands of hours of FM over the years, I felt like I was pretty fair about reloading matches - I only tended to do it if I had a bad injury to a star I'd just signed, or conceded a BS glitch/bug goal, etc. Sometimes if I was having a bad day and fired up FM only to be down 4-0 to Man City in the 35th minute I'd just Ctl-Alt-Delete and replay the match a few days later. But with my new save in FM21, I've been experimenting with a strict no-save-scumming policy, and it's added a whole new compelling element to my gameplay. I had a real stinker of a game against Newcastle (5-0 I think) - the sort of game I'd have been tempted to reload in the past - and a day later my players refunded the supporters' tickets for the match. How cool is that!? I also got to within one bad result of getting sacked, and had to get something away at Sheffield Utd - what a nerve-racking match that was! My boys pulled out a 3-1 win to keep me alive, and we had a short run of good form to finish the season, allowing me to get the transfer reinforcements I desperately needed. 

So TL;DR: FM is hands down the best sports management sim on the market, I felt it was well worth the money to upgrade from FM18 to FM21, and if you've never experimented with a no-save-scum policy - give it a whirl. I think you'll find it rewarding."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Football Manager 2021 hasn’t really rocked the boat in terms of enhancing the matchday gaming experience from last year. Games are as  difficult as ever to manage, and the minutiae of detail is just as overwhelming as always. Rather than a complete overhaul, there are numerous minor tweaks in Football Manager 2021, affecting tactical exploration and simulation. This time around, energy levels in particular seem to play a greater role, presumably to combat previously effective pressing tactics. In other words,  you can’t rely on your tried-and-tested methods from last year to get by.

Football Manager 2021‘s biggest change seems to come in the way that you, as a Manager, communicate. Gone are the meaningless emotions while addressing people; instead, your decisions are broken down into what really matters. While talking to players, the boardroom or press, you can respond in a much more clear way. You’ll be able to choose from responses that are positive, negative, convincing, or even backing down. Better yet, the intended meaning of everything you say is clearly laid out.

The communication overhaul really adds a lot to how you are judged as a manager in Football Manager 2021. Yes, results are still important, but you can really change the parameters of what your personal success is. If you aren’t doing especially well but are achieving the promises you have set out, you will be given more time.

This happened to me; in my first season of managing, I had slightly underachieved. But because I had delivered on my promise to repair the financial damage of the over bloated squad, I wasn’t kicked out at the end of the season where I might’ve been in previous instalments. The next season, having been able to gain control of the finances, I was able to cultivate success. This is a new experience for me in a Football Manager game; a series I’ve been playing for over a decade. While I may have improved the finances of a club before, I have never overtly communicated my goals to the boardroom and insisted on time to deliver.

Football Manager 2021 has done something that great managers do: it has acknowledged its weaknesses and improved upon them without completely rocking the boat. It still feels truly familiar as a Football Manager game, but the overhaul to expectations and communication makes for a more coherent and impactful experience. There’s more of a focus on what you say and do in your role as a manager and, over seasons, your performance is better judged. It makes a real difference to how the game can play out. The matchday experience may not be massively improved, but the improved focus elsewhere makes a real difference. For anyone who truly likes to get into the role of manager, Football Manager 2021 is a must."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Football manager 2021 is another great hit that again showcases as poor the Fifa games currently are.

This game provides a fair and balanced system which lets you do well if you know what your doing and are prepared for opposition but if you try and speed it: you get really something back for being bad.

I enjoy the ethic of always improving. I feel very immersed and determined to become a better manager. For example, I had a bad playoff season with Nashville in the MLS. I got so annoyed because we lost to a trash team so I berated the players and got rid of dead wood. I then signed top prospects and I'm now in the running of finishing 1st in the supporter's shield.

I love this game. It's hard at first but honestly give it a shot and once you have a good graspe of the game, you'll become Arsene Wenger's invincibles."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"It pains me to write this but after spending more than 400 hours I have to admit: it's a poorly designed game with artifical difficulty spikes designed to keep players engaged. You can be the by far best team in the league and you will always have a seasonal rival (undocumented in-game) which will keep the pace with you. You can be a heavy-weight in a small league and there will be a team which is not better than any other in competitions which will go with the same results as you. 

Worst part when the game decides that it should boost your real rival. I have just one example of it: playing in UPL with Shakhtar I managed to finish the season with 28 wins and 2 draws in the 30 games. Guess what was the gap with Dynamo Kiev? 2 points. The third place was like 20 points lower. A season before I lost the league to Vorskla - it had lost points in 4 games through the whole season and my only loss was to them. I had numerous finishings in previous seasons with different teams when on the last match day the leader was losing, my team coming second won and then the third team became the first on goal difference, winning 5-0 and scoring its last goal on the last minutes in injury time. I get that it happens in football, see Man City and Aguero, but not in the course of couple of seasons in a row.

Apart of that the game is addicting as ever although SI doesn't care for bug fixing (top managers have like perpetual contracts, in my 15 season save Simeone, Conte, OGS, Pochettino and Flick ALL were managing their starting cubs) and their UI designer clearly hates people - I can't find any reason to make the UI overloaded mess in dark purple color. In 2021 SI didn't even care to add additional skins leaving it to fans. Really, you become so lazy? You had to tweak a couple of lines of code to do that.

Match engine looks much better until you realize that it relies heavily on the patterns. If you get that patterns, you can exploit it, and if you want to keep it natural you will face artificial difficulty spikes. Maybe in 2000s it was the same, I don't know, it all felt like an unscripted free flow and now you can guess the outcome of episode 90% times the 3D field appears.

Tactics make no sense, as you can't play defensive football relying to soak the pressure - it's instantly punished by the opposition. Players with 5 in long shots suddenly pull of Roberto Carlos if you play defensive and there is no way to explain it but the match engine flaws. If the game decides that it's time to score, it will score. To play attacking you should do counter-intuitive things (deep defensive line and low pressure against the last team in a league is a must or you will be heavily beaten with the magic 30-meter screamers).

On top of that you have the SI community forums with extremely gatekeeping audience which is intolerable to any criticism of their game. Moderators delete negative comments claiming they welcome meaningful discussion and constructive criticism. Like, I'm a paying customer who gets banned for stating that I'm not that happy with what I've payed for. In all my years online I've never seen more toxic and hostile community - even Reddit is friendly and supportive in comparison. Think twice before sponsoring it. I was a big fan of FM in 2005 - 2012 editions, I haven't really played for 8 years and I had over 700 extremely frustrating and unrewarding hours in 2020/21 versions. I won't buy it before they fix the UI and fire their UI designer. I can't possibly recommend the game which is made with the goal to frustrate the players and encourage exploits."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Imagine playing Leeds on the final day of the season as Brighton manager. Your best player and top goalscorer is missing through injury. You must beat Leeds to win the league after an outstanding season. its 0-0 but then Leeds strike in the 67th minute to go 1-0 up. You begin your heart starting to break. But then out of nowhere, Lewis Dunk rises from a corner on the 79th minute to equalise. There's a glimmer of hope restored. Man Utd fans hear of your equaliser in their game and become anxious. The 90th minute arrives and its still 1-1. You can hear Man Utd's fans celebrating already. You have a freekick on the edge of the box though ..... MacAllister steps up. ITS IN!!!!! Its the last kick off the game!! The beer you have in your hand which was meant to drown your sorrows goes everywhere in celebration, including over your best suit which you was wearing because its such an iconic moment in Brighton FC's history!

Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"I finally upgraded to FM21 after skipping FM19 & 20 - mostly it was the xG feature that piqued my interest, but I also like to update every so often for little things like competition rule/qualification changes, refreshing rosters, etc. Coming from FM18, I've been pleasantly surprised at some of the new features added in FM21 - not only do I really enjoy the xG thing, I love the overall improvement in what I'd call ""realism"": The interaction with staff continues to get better and better, the way staff and management present you with reports and call meetings is awesome, and the scouting meetings before transfer windows are so damn cool. It all combines to make you feel like you're actually a manager and not just playing a game. I'm at around 230 hours of FM21 and I'm still constantly finding myself engaging with new things. 

Last, I'd just like to share my experience/thoughts on scum-saving. For the most part during my thousands of hours of FM over the years, I felt like I was pretty fair about reloading matches - I only tended to do it if I had a bad injury to a star I'd just signed, or conceded a BS glitch/bug goal, etc. Sometimes if I was having a bad day and fired up FM only to be down 4-0 to Man City in the 35th minute I'd just Ctl-Alt-Delete and replay the match a few days later. But with my new save in FM21, I've been experimenting with a strict no-save-scumming policy, and it's added a whole new compelling element to my gameplay. I had a real stinker of a game against Newcastle (5-0 I think) - the sort of game I'd have been tempted to reload in the past - and a day later my players refunded the supporters' tickets for the match. How cool is that!? I also got to within one bad result of getting sacked, and had to get something away at Sheffield Utd - what a nerve-racking match that was! My boys pulled out a 3-1 win to keep me alive, and we had a short run of good form to finish the season, allowing me to get the transfer reinforcements I desperately needed. 

So TL;DR: FM is hands down the best sports management sim on the market, I felt it was well worth the money to upgrade from FM18 to FM21, and if you've never experimented with a no-save-scum policy - give it a whirl. I think you'll find it rewarding."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Football Manager 2021 hasn’t really rocked the boat in terms of enhancing the matchday gaming experience from last year. Games are as  difficult as ever to manage, and the minutiae of detail is just as overwhelming as always. Rather than a complete overhaul, there are numerous minor tweaks in Football Manager 2021, affecting tactical exploration and simulation. This time around, energy levels in particular seem to play a greater role, presumably to combat previously effective pressing tactics. In other words,  you can’t rely on your tried-and-tested methods from last year to get by.

Football Manager 2021‘s biggest change seems to come in the way that you, as a Manager, communicate. Gone are the meaningless emotions while addressing people; instead, your decisions are broken down into what really matters. While talking to players, the boardroom or press, you can respond in a much more clear way. You’ll be able to choose from responses that are positive, negative, convincing, or even backing down. Better yet, the intended meaning of everything you say is clearly laid out.

The communication overhaul really adds a lot to how you are judged as a manager in Football Manager 2021. Yes, results are still important, but you can really change the parameters of what your personal success is. If you aren’t doing especially well but are achieving the promises you have set out, you will be given more time.

This happened to me; in my first season of managing, I had slightly underachieved. But because I had delivered on my promise to repair the financial damage of the over bloated squad, I wasn’t kicked out at the end of the season where I might’ve been in previous instalments. The next season, having been able to gain control of the finances, I was able to cultivate success. This is a new experience for me in a Football Manager game; a series I’ve been playing for over a decade. While I may have improved the finances of a club before, I have never overtly communicated my goals to the boardroom and insisted on time to deliver.

Football Manager 2021 has done something that great managers do: it has acknowledged its weaknesses and improved upon them without completely rocking the boat. It still feels truly familiar as a Football Manager game, but the overhaul to expectations and communication makes for a more coherent and impactful experience. There’s more of a focus on what you say and do in your role as a manager and, over seasons, your performance is better judged. It makes a real difference to how the game can play out. The matchday experience may not be massively improved, but the improved focus elsewhere makes a real difference. For anyone who truly likes to get into the role of manager, Football Manager 2021 is a must."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Football manager 2021 is another great hit that again showcases as poor the Fifa games currently are.

This game provides a fair and balanced system which lets you do well if you know what your doing and are prepared for opposition but if you try and speed it: you get really something back for being bad.

I enjoy the ethic of always improving. I feel very immersed and determined to become a better manager. For example, I had a bad playoff season with Nashville in the MLS. I got so annoyed because we lost to a trash team so I berated the players and got rid of dead wood. I then signed top prospects and I'm now in the running of finishing 1st in the supporter's shield.

I love this game. It's hard at first but honestly give it a shot and once you have a good graspe of the game, you'll become Arsene Wenger's invincibles."
Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"It pains me to write this but after spending more than 400 hours I have to admit: it's a poorly designed game with artifical difficulty spikes designed to keep players engaged. You can be the by far best team in the league and you will always have a seasonal rival (undocumented in-game) which will keep the pace with you. You can be a heavy-weight in a small league and there will be a team which is not better than any other in competitions which will go with the same results as you. 

Worst part when the game decides that it should boost your real rival. I have just one example of it: playing in UPL with Shakhtar I managed to finish the season with 28 wins and 2 draws in the 30 games. Guess what was the gap with Dynamo Kiev? 2 points.

2.5d graphic style works really well for this game's aesthetic.

The soundtrack is most definitely another great selling point to this game. Not only does it include some returning favorites from the first game, but basically every track they added to this one is a certified banger.

I would definitely say its well worth the full price of $20 but if you were to get this game when it goes on sale (which is like Monthly/Bi-Monthly) discounted price for this is even more of a great deal"

Eleven Table Tennis,Sports,488310, ping pong with extra steps
Eleven Table Tennis,Sports,488310,Connection issues between players make this game terrible overall even though the fundamentals and mechanics are spot on. Wish they could resolve the latency issues between players. Having ping pong balls seemingly miss the other person's paddle only to be vaulted over to you at half table out of nowhere takes all the fun out of this.
PGA TOUR 2K21,Sports,1016120,"First off, the game engine seems solid. The physics of hitting a golf ball, the way in lands and rolls all seem spot on. The problem is the inconsistencies with the games swing timing and swing path. It's either too sensitive, or too shot dependent. The concept is good, just not implemented the best. 

PGA career is okay, except wildly unrealistic. You can be -10 through 9 holes and Justin Thomas will be right behind you at -9 somehow. If you shoot +5 then the leaders start losing strokes and will sit at like -5 and wait for you to catch up and then they start nailing eagles and birdies again. 

The game feels alive at times with the crowd, but at the same time so empty. You can't play rounds with AI golfers. A feature I very much miss with the old Tiger Woods PGA games. You can however play online matches against script modding hackers who you cannot beat which is cool. And that's about all I'll say about multiplayer.

The game does have some rewarding times. For me it's just playing a casual round at one of my favorite courses with nothing to lose or gain. Other than that, this game fails at being a proper golf simulation, even though it does well at simulating golf....Don't buy at full price."

Knockout City™,Sports,1301210,"Dear god, this game is amazing.

Easy to pick up, pretty satisfying to master. (1v1 mode is SOOO fun as a side break to hone your personal skills)

Once you get past the initial ""Toss fully charged ball"" & Catch ""Spamming"",
you start realizing theres wayyyyy more to it than that.

-The ""Fakeout"" game, (faking throws to get opponent to prematurely attempt to catch it)

-Throwing an UNCHARGED slow ball to throw off enemy timing!

-Get behind an enemy while teammate is in front of him with charged ball, have him pass to you and MAX-Charged ball toss into the back of his head for an easy K.O.!

-Enemy always seems to know you're targeting them and ready to catch?
Why not target their teammate or elsewhere and last second flick to them and toss a fully charged ball! Works wonders!

-If you and an opponent each have balls and he tosses first, why toss yours too?
Pass yours to a teammate for insta-max speed boost and take the opponent's ball and RUSH HIM!

-Turning yourself into a ball and getting fully charged into a mega-bomb is cool and all but it rarely works against decent players, but how about NOT charging all the way and using my luscious body to ONE-SHOT enemies instead?

-Tired of being hit by multiple incoming balls? DASH instead of getting tricked into catching 24/7
-Dash-deflecting shots for teammates?
-Be a dedicated tackler while your teammates lob balls at them?

AND SO MUCH MORE!

This game has the depth required to retain the attention of even the most Sweaty E-sport fanatic (TTV included in their names)
-The art style is fun and lively.
-The progression system (so far) is a nice selection of awesome cosmetics that aren't just re-colors like most games.
-Ranked playlist
-rotating game modes to keep things fresh.

Like Guilds, Clans, Groups, etc?

Create your own CREW.
Customize logos, banners, AND YOUR OWN FRIGGIN SQUAD CAR.

TL;DR: 
Plenty of mechanics and progression systems to keep E-sport sweaty Tryhards going,
easy enough to pick up for Candy Crush frequents to have fun."

[i]Knockout City[/i] is a team-based, deathmatch, arena-like, competitive shooter that has a quite unique setting: It’s pretty much dodgeball but crazier!

[b]Gameplay[/b]

The Gameplay is pretty simple, I mean it’s pretty much dodgeball – you can pass to your team mates, you can throw balls normal, curved or from over your head & you can also throw your own team mates! There are normal and special balls in this game – each special ball has different advantages and they vary from sniper balls to bomb like balls. 

Before the start of a match, one out of five special balls will be randomly selected and will spawn multiple times on the map for players to pick & use. 

There are currently six maps in the game. Every map has their own flair to it which makes the game more enjoyable and invites people to have different strategies for every map.

[i]Knockout City[/i] offers a handful of different play modes, although Team KO ([i]which is pretty much team deathmatch[/i]) seems to be the most popular one. Their take on known play modes like kill confirmed ([i]mostly known from Call of Duty[/i]) is pretty decent as well. There is also a mode in which you have to use your team mates as balls.

The game also offers two ranked modes. The first one is basically Team KO and the second one is a 1vs1 match with no special balls. There is no indicator when you get targeted with a ball and a deadly zone shrinks the map over time in the 1vs1 ranked match.

[b]Personal Note[/b]

I think the idea of having a dodgeball shooter with some easy to pick up mechanics is pretty awesome! It’s also somewhat unique since there are no dodgeball games out there like this one. 

Throwing, dodging and catching the balls feel pretty good and satisfying. Passing the ball to team mates and using your mates as balls is pretty well made as well, especially the idea of having some sort of ultimate when you charge your throw long enough to make your team mate become a bomb.

In general, this game is very fun to play and it’s just super simple to pick up and learn. You don’t need to have friend to play with to enjoy the game but personally I’d recommend it because you get rewarded for playing with friends and / or crewmates. There were also some event quests that required you to play with friends – so I assume that in upcoming events it might be useful to have some friends to play with if you care about rewards. 

Speaking of rewards: You get a bunch of rewards for just playing the game. The rewards seem to be random but everyone should get the same rewards eventually. There is an in-game shop that offers cosmetics for the premium currency as well – which you can either buy with real money or with the premium currency that you get from playing as well.

[b]Rating[/b]
[list][b]Pros[/b]
[*] Easy to pick up and play
[*] Straight forward mechanics
[*] Simple game modes
[*] Short matches
[*] Lots of cool cosmetics that fit the vibe of the game
[*] Very catchy and good music
[*] Incredible announcer for pre- and in-game events
[*] Good graphic & sound design
[*] Interesting retro & futuristic aesthetics
[*] You can play for free for a certain amount of time / levels (1)
[/list]
[list][b]Cons[/b]
[*] The dodge mechanic can be spammed
[*] An Origin account is required to play the game (2)
[*] Some options won’t save after restarting the game (3)
[/list]

(1) The game offers you a trial version on steam that currently allows you to play for 25 levels before getting asked to purchase the game. You can find more information about this [url= https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1301210/view/3008947103106006903]here[/url]

(2) Since an Origin account is needed to play this game, some people might just skip on this game entirely – which is a shame. I personally don’t mind that I need to have an Origin account though.

(3) As of now (31.05.2021) there is a weird bug which resets certain options every time you restart the game. For me it’s the Depth of Field option and the mouse sensitivity. There are a lot of posts about this on the steam community tab so I hope this will be fixed soon.

[b]Conclusion[/b] 

Is [i]Knockout City[/i] worth to get? For me personally – yes! I’ve played the trial version for around 5 hours and I almost got hooked instantly to the game. If you have some friends to play with and if you like a deathmatch orientated multiplayer game which is easy to pick up, this might be something for you. The game is fun to play and its unique dodgeball-type of game makes its pretty special. I think casual and competitive players will have a lot of fun with this game.

If you are not sure if you like the game, you can try it out via the trial version.

"
MX Bikes,Sports,655500,"Coming from a motocross and outdoor enduro background, this game is extremely accurate and realist opposed to the popular ME Supercross or MX Vs. ATV games. The physics are something I would compare to MX Simulator because you can move in ways most MX games can't. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone with a MX background or someone who can understand the mechanics and way the bike reacts to certain things."

MX Bikes,Sports,655500,"MX Bikes is the perfect game for the motocross/supercross enthusiast. As someone who has ridden dirt bikes for the majority of my life, I can confidently say that this is the best MX simulator your money can buy. Physics-based riding means that you can accurately pull off whips, nasty scrubs, big jumps and oppos just as you would in real-life. It is, essentially, a better and more fun all-around simulator than it's biggest competitor, MX Simulator.]

PROS:

- Accurately simulated riding physics allow you to pull off anything you would see a MX/SX rider do on the track
- Challenging-yet-rewarding gameplay will keep you coming back, especially once you start to get fast
- Multiplayer races can be very fun and exciting, especially with skilled players
- Tweakable difficulty settings to allow beginners to more easily learn the basics
- In-depth bike tuning allow you to properly adjust your bike to the track and conditions
- A mix of vanilla motocross and supercross tracks to start off with, ranging in difficulty from easy to very hard
- Additional simulated features such as fuel, tire wear, and tearoffs are included that add additional factors to your race
- Very active modding community that add tracks, new bikes, skins, gear, and other things to ensure longevity

CONS:

- Lack of a singleplayer career and AI, which may be bothersome to players used to the MX vs. ATV style experience
- Very hard and frustrating to beginners, as you will crash, ALOT!
- Not a whole ton of vanilla content, but there are a ton of mods that make up for this
- No in-game tuning or riding guides to aid beginners
- Outdated UI, which may be bothersome to some players
- Outdated graphics which may be bothersome to some players

CONCLUSION & TIPS

Overall, I 100% recommend this game at full-price to anybody looking for an authentic and realistic MX simulation game. I do not recommend this to casual players looking for a pickup-and-play experience.

Prepare to crash alot, (and I mean alot!) during your first 10 hours or so of gameplay. Start off slow, learn the mechanics and controls, and just focus on doing clean laps, no matter how slow you may be. Stay seated at all times while you're learning the basics. I recommend the ""Forest Raceway"" track as a beginner track, as it is very easy to learn, and also very popular in multiplayer it seems. Watch/read guides to learn how to do more technical moves, such as whips and scrubs. And last of all, don't give up! Everyone starts off crashing. Just keep going!

MX Bikes,Sports,655500,"if you like dirt bikes and physics based games this is incredibly satisfying to play. Im about 30 hours in and just now can make clean laps after various settings and technique changes and experimenting. The pay off of the time you put in makes those clean laps where youre cleanly flying through the air blissful and adrenaline pumping. 

I was hesitant because of the price but trust me it will pay off if you like games that you really have to put in work to be good."

MX Bikes,Sports,655500,"Coming from a motocross and outdoor enduro background, this game is extremely accurate and realist opposed to the popular ME Supercross or MX Vs. ATV games. The physics are something I would compare to MX Simulator because you can move in ways most MX games can't. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone with a MX background or someone who can understand the mechanics and way the bike reacts to certain things."

Session: Skateboarding Sim Game,Sports,861650,"i really hate how this still feels like a tech demo after years since taking my money, dont care how ""real"" others make it out the physics is janky at the best of times."
Session: Skateboarding Sim Game,Sports,861650,"love this game so fucking much, please add map challenges =)"
Session: Skateboarding Sim Game,Sports,861650,"    I have owned this game for a little while now, but I still just can't bring myself to play it for more than a couple hours at a time. It just doesn't feel good, sure the difficulty makes it rewarding to land a cool trick but the broken filming system immediately kills that feeling. It is now 2021 and Session is still WAY too unfinished to recommend to anyone.
    The game just looks eerie imo, I'm not sure what it is, the textures and everything are technically acceptable and realistic, but something about the lighting and look of the game feels like skating in gmod. Everything looks and feels dead.
    There is STILL almost no working transition or vert, landing in a bank is a complete gamble, maybe you'll roll out smooth maybe you'll stop in your tracks and fly off your board. Let alone tricking UP a ramp, chances are even lower that you'll pull that off. Same with a lot of the rails and grind physics, although admittedly this is much more consistent than trying to ride slopes. This ties in to the ugly look of the skating too; your skater just doesn't move their body in a super convincing way, especially when it comes to riding angled surfaces and landing difficult or unique tricks. It's robotic, kinda like the skate games kinda except it really doesn't fit here and even skate 1 looks better.

    The mod community is okay, there are some talented individuals trying their best to make this game fun but it's a bit like polishing a turd. If you want to feel the frustration of skating in real life trying the same one trick over and over, you could enjoy this game. But if you wanna put together sweet smooth lines and actually be stoked on how it looks, this game doesn't cut it to me. Even if you manage to pull one off, chances are you won't be able to record it anyway.
    Theres definitely something here but the game is just way too buggy right now. I know the skater xl comparison is a bit tired by now, and most of the good things about THAT game come from mods, but at least it works most of the time.
tl;dr
This game may be good one day, but judging by the current state it won't be anytime soon. If you can handle the buggy robotic style and value difficulty over flow, there is plenty of fun to be had, you just gotta force it.

Ultimate Fishing Simulator,Sports,468920,Could be a bit more intuitive but it is an excellent simulation.  I am 60 years old and fished most of my life both north and in the southern U.S.  This software provides an excellently realistic experience and makes me use everything I have learned through the years to be a successful fisherman.  I only wish I could keep some of the prizes for my skillet!!!
Ultimate Fishing Simulator,Sports,468920,"The fishing life
I've been playing approximately 55 hrs now about to reach lvl 14 anxiously awaiting for the accomplished ability to purchase live fish bait at the bait & tackle store, and I'm amazed at the devs' attention to every detail by providing dynamic scenery represented by the different cultural aspects of the gaming fishing locations such as the placid scenic & sensual beauty of Betty lake; the cold rocky appeal of Baikal Lake; the country of Greenland's provoking old traditional look of a small village overlooking a sea bordered by mountainous craggy rocks.
What really overwhelms me is the picturesque underwater fishing UI module that UF developed blowing my mind in excited anticipation as a big imposing fish slowly approaches -in -my-face to take my bait while playing on my PC.
What if the devs' incorporate dramatizations like movie film producers & directors do when presenting scenes like unexpected events occurring in the aquatic background while in the foreground you're doing your thing with your Console, Mobile or PC? For example a scene where a fish is taking another gamer's bait, or various garbage is falling in the water above, or a dead body legs and feet dangling held down by a heavy weight suddenly splashes in the lake?  That would be awesome."

Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,Bottom line is this is the most realistic racing simulator (steering feel with a direct drive wheel) you can get today. I am a performance driving instructor and race endurance cars in real life and train with AMS2.
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"I've been playing AMS2 now since it was first released in early access. And boy let me tell you this whole year has been a journey!
I'm racing in real life for over 14 years. And never have I experienced a sim that comes so incredibly close to the real thing than AMS2. For example: the rain conditions. SPOT ON! I've raced a lot in the wet. And I love it. When I drove in AMS2 for the first time in the rain. I was blown away how realistic this is.

After some time I started in some leagues. I've found great friends from everywhere in the world that are really great guys to race with. And of course at some point I created my own league. So yesterday was the release of the Racin' USA pack. What we got is revolutionary for simracing! We have 42 years of weather data from every day on every track. If I want to drive in rainy Hockenheim 2019, sure, nothing is going to stop me. I can even use the weather from Imola 1988 for example. That. Is. Mind. Blowing!

Now onto the physics. Many people don't liked them before the update. But they'll gonna like it now. You feel like you are really there in the sim. In the car and on the track.
The Youtubers that don't even have a go casually in AMS2 are so wrong. 

And now after the update a lot of online lobbys are there that are full with drivers. I've hosted multiple servers today and I had on each server max 28 drivers. AMS2 is a new Standart in sim racing. This is the future. This sim is done by a incredibly small team with a very limited budget. But look what it's become. It's become the best sim there ever was. And I've played them all!"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"This is by far and away the most underappreciated sim out there! I have been playing this almost exclusively for the past few months. The FFB (with custom RFuktor file) is as good as anything else on the market. Don't believe everything you see/ read about AMS2. IT IS NOT A SIMCADE. THE FFB IS NOT CRAP. IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE PC2 (in-game). THE MADNESS ENGINE IS NOT ARCADEY. 

THIS GAME HAS THE BEST BASE GRAPHICS OF ANY SIM OUT THERE (INCLUDING ACC), THIS GAME HAS THE BEST WEATHER EFFECTS. IT HAS A GREAT TYRE MODEL. MOST CARS DRIVE BRILLIANTLY OUT THE BOX BUT THERE IS PLENTY OF REALISTIC CUSTOMISATION THAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE CARS.

Everything about this game is shaping up for me. We are merely half way through the development cycle. I cannot wait to see where this game will be a year from now."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"You MUST try this game. I cannot overstate this.. I'm starting with that, because I really think (if you came here to check it out), you won't be disappointed. You have nothing to lose. Give it a 2 hour try. You won't return it.
I know that there are many opinions about this game. I've heard about low numbers in multiplayer, the game is still in development, etc.. Sure, Reiza is still updating and improving this game. Bugs still exist.. fine.. 
But.. if you enjoy racing simulators, are tired of having to mod the heck out of AC just to get it to look like there is weather, if you want more than the same F1 20xx year after year, if you want a racing simulator that has just about every type of vehicle, from all different racing era's (1960s to modern), you owe it to yourself to give this a try.
The variety of race vehicles is mind boggling. And every vehicle has its own sound, its own feel. Try a kart similar to what you will find at your local kart racing track.. the sound of the 2 cycle engine, the incredibly frustrating time delay to get it up to speed, it is all very realistic.. 
Cars:
The Formula 1 cars, from the 1960s era, into the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and modern ... it is crazy.. These are NOT just vehicles painted to look like they belong in a particular era. They sound and feel like you are in a real Formula 1 car from that era. Each one is unique, from the impossible to control 60s lightweight cars, to the whining engines of the 70s, to the turbos of the 80s, and into the modern cars.. each era, and each car, has its own feel and sound. They did not copy / paste these.
The GT series cars.. I can't even begin to describe how good these are.. if you're into modern GT racing, you have everything, GT3, GT4, GTE, ... take the Corvette out for a spin.. you will not believe the sound... 
I have never driven a real race car, only sims.. but the feeling of one of these when turning a corner, pushing the limit of slip... it just feels right, 
The ""alternative"" cars... there is so much here.. just so much.. from the 1970s era stock cars such as Opala, Chevette, .. just really cool cars that were raced in real life on local tracks in Brazil and South America. This is a world those of us in North America and the rest of the world seem to have missed.. it is a very dedicated racing community down there.. and AMS2 represents it well.
The tracks.. every track is .. simply better than what you will see in any other sim.. there are many historical tracks, which (based on the scenery) really make you FEEL like you are back in time.. no safer barriers, sometimes no walls lol.. everything along the track looks like the era you are in... 
The weather... you MUST try this game if not only for the weather. Real weather updates, or make your own. The way the weather progresses, the way the water on the track affects your car, how this all looks... no way to describe it.. try it... 
There is no way to describe, the sun setting in the west, when the rain stops, and the track is still partially wet, but the glimmer and reflection on the small patches of water on the tracks.. and as day turns from day to late afternoon... the shadows... darker in some spots... sun on the horizon.. simply beautiful.
The AI..
In my opinion, the AI is some of the best out there. They will fight you for position, not just go to sleep, but will race you fair. If you have a position going into a turn, they will typically back off.. but they will continue to push you.. again.. again.. they don't just give up.. so you will have your hands full for an entire race.
You can pit and let your teammate take over.. he/she will drive until you want them to come back in. 
So.. I saved the bad parts for the end, but these should not prevent you from trying this game!
Multiplayer: Still a lower player count. You can find, at any time, about 25 to 50 players online.. perhaps 1 or 2 races which have 10 players.. these numbers are increasing weekly. (I am an offline player so I don't care about these things).
Championship bugs. They offer a custom championship mode for offline players like me. It still has bugs (refueling not allowed, points not assigned correctly), but Reiza has been phenomenal in there diligence to fix issues, so there is no doubt in my mind that these will be fixed.
If you want a game that you don't have to do ANY mods to make it work, give this a try."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"Probably the greatest pretend race cars sim out there at the moment. Good tire model that really relies on a good setup rather than aiming to hit a certain pressure, good handling characteristics that rely on your ability to set up the car, great tuning options, lots of tracks, lots of cars. It handles well, and the rFuktor FFB addon is mandatory and fantastic. Probably the best feel I've gotten from any race sim.

I messed around with AMS2 when it first came out, and it felt uncomplete to me, kind of like it was missing a lot of stuff. I fiddled around with various cars at various tracks, particularly the BMW Procar at Suzuka. But it felt off, and I simply waited for the updates to settle down a bit. Then 1.2 came out recently so I got back into it. Imagine my surprise when I spent the next 6 hours fiddling around with the Procar and the 2020 Brazil Stock Car and had an absolute blast. The tweaking of parameters is so much more intuitive and responsive than in other games, and can make an awful beast turn into a docile and fast race car. I've had a lot of fun so far and I think the game is finally in a state to recommend.

The game is very setup-dependent. You NEED to tweak the cars a bit in order to get them just right and fun to drive. But it doesn't take long! Maybe 30 minutes of practice at most. There's a great series by Steelcast/Steelreserve on Youtube and it's also linked in the Guides section on Steam. Highly recommend that too.

Great game and sim. Heartily recommend especially since it's come such a long way in the last year. Support small devs!"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"+Total sim; driving feels correct
+Great rain effects and tire wear and feedback you can feel through your racing wheel
+Visually solid
+Many unique cars/vehicles not found in other sims
+Plenty of unique real-world tracks not found in other sims
+An overkill of options/settings
+No single-player progression; come ready

-Presentation lacking; bare-bones
-Missing many cars found in most other racing sims
-No ""default"" option after messing around with settings
-Triple screen setup has many options, but unintuitive (might take some effort to get it right)
-No achievements
-No traditional/typical single-player career mode (what's there is basically a create-your-own-championship mode)
-No single-player progression; come ready

=====================================

There's really no game here.   It's a simulator."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"AMS 2 is phenomenal. I own basically every sim game you can think of, and this is still one of the best IMO. Is it 100% hardcore real? No. Its like 90% real in terms of physics. You'll notice that it's slightly easier to corner in this game compared to other sims, but it's negligible. Maybe I'll just do a list of pros and cons or something to make this an efficient review for others to go over. 

(A quick note. This is NOT PC2 just slightly changed and reskinned. AMS 2 is completely different except for a few UI things.)

Pros:

-Best FFB hands down. It just feels right in every single way!
-Best VR experience. It's just flawless and never stutters or skips.
-Best graphics. The sky! The sky when transitioning between day and night is unlike any other sim.
-Racing with friends. This is THE EASIEST game to setup a multiplayer room for you & your friends.
-UI. The UI is intuitive and easy to understand.
-Free content constantly added.
-Frequent updates (Debatable whether a pro or con)

Cons:

-The AI. JFC the AI are dumb. They will run right through you causing you to crash, hold you up, block you like crazy, etc. No other AI infuriates me as much as the AMS 2 AI. The AI makes me crash 10x more than any other sim I own. As a note, I play at 106 Skill and 50 Aggression atm.
-Still a lot of little annoying bugs that can ruin the experience at times.
-Still lacking customization, but that's a moot point.
-Some of the content you may want in a sim simply isn't here because its more Brazilian focused. There's a big BUT here though because new content that most other sims have is constantly being added (Look at GT3, GTE, and DPi to name a few)

Those are the pros and cons that I can come up with atm. Would I recommend this game? Yes! I recommend this sim to every single person that is into sim racing. Just buy it and see what I mean. This will remain one of my favorite sims for the next 10 years at least."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"The cars feel and look amazing, the tracks are incredible, it performs flawlessly (especially in VR), and it's constantly being updated - what more could you possibly want? 

The only things that could make this better for me is more LMP1 cars (an Audi R18 or Porsche 919 would literally make this 10/10 for me) and more lights at night (Nurburgring could do with some spectator activity like campfires and neon lights just to give it that appropriate feel).

Keep up the amazing work!"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"After the 1.2 update this game is now fantastic. 

Just extra work to the MP please, thanks."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,The sim that keeps getting better and better!
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,The latest update is amazing - great FF - great Vr performance.
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,yes
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"I guess the driving is okay, never had the opportunity to drive a racecar so can't compare, is not an arcade game for sure.

Cars: incredible variety of machines, from karts to trucks, 80's/90's 100hp hatchbacks, tubs with wheels to actual F1, the now famous GT3, also GT4 and GT5, etc. 

Tracks: the same, from kart renting to 10 corner Brazilian club and to the Green hell, try new tracks you never driven before, they are so much fun!

Pretty well optimized, it has VR.
 
It's reasonably priced, what are you wanting for?"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,Great sim for people who love multiclass racing. It features motorsport classics like the Nordschleife as well as much niche content and histotic racing.
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"I've rarely seen a developer so dedicated to improving its product, and while I do have some qualms about the way it goes about improving its product, I will say that the progress made in a year since release has been impressive.

It's not there yet, not at all, but it has a lot going for it. First, it's gorgeous. It's literally the best-looking sim racing title I've ever played. 

Second, the physics, while not to everybody's taste, are a unique interpretation of reality. I'm not a real race car driver, so I can't comment on the realism, but some of these cars are an absolute joy to drive. 

There are still (June 2021) some major issues with this game, such as the bare bones multiplayer experience with no rankings, as well as just a general severe lack of polish (setups are a pain, pit stops are wonky, AI is inconsistent from track to track, the UI could use some major customisation, the number of liveries on some cars is very low and can't be expanded by creating more, some classes are a bit wonky to the neophyte (for example, unless you're a hardcore F1 historian, good luck parsing through the Formula Classic, which has the G1M1, G1M2, G2M1, G2M2, G2M3, G3M1, G3M2, G3M3... and then you have to figure out what's classic and what's retro (Retro G1 and Retro G2), or is it Formula Vintage (G1 or G2?) and how either of these differ from a vintage Formula V10 G1, Formula V10 G2, or Formula V12) - and telling the Formula Reiza and the Formula Ultimate apart is another can of worms). I know licensing is a thing, but it could just have been so much cleaner by just using years instead, calling cars ""Formula 1993 V12"" or what have you, rather than trying to figure out what the difference between the   Formula Classic G3M1 and the Formula V12 is. It's just not obvious.

The TL;DR: It's an incredibly raw game, to be sure, but it has amazing potential, and the sky's the limit for this title. I'm getting in on the ground floor, and I love it. If you want a more polished experience, perhaps wait a bit. It hasn't surpassed Assetto Corsa, the gold standard of sim racing, but it does offer superior graphics and far superior multiplayer settings. So, despite it being rather raw, I love racing with friends and bots."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"Launched it almost a year after purchase ans since last time I played. Changes a huge. Car feels very realistic (with a good wheel and in VR), With a good PC (not a top - R5, 16Gb, 5700XT) game is awesome!!!"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"It is definitely neither perfect, nor complete. But it is fun. I do like it overall more than other sims (despite Dirt..which is my favorite), because...

* Completely controllable with the wheel
* The UI is simple
* Nordschleife, Spa + Historicals
* Fun (though not 100% accurate simulated)
* The upcoming weather system (prediction for past 40 years including foliage change)

I am a casual sim racer, powering on sims (Dirt and AMS 2) like 2-3 times a week for about 30 minutes per session. Just hot lapping my favorite tracks. That's just it. For this kind of racers, it is just perfect :-)"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,It's now a challenger...
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"The best sim currently available in my oppinion. Plenty of tracks and cars without the need for dlc unlike other popular titles I won't mention. Great FFB feel. Very real with lots of capacity to personalise controls. Awesome graphics. Some occasional glitching depending on the latest update but then my graphics cards card is pretty basic. 
Awesome racing sim. Fully recommended."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"This is a racing game for the casual player that doesn't want to play an arcade game, which is were I think Project Cars 2 was. Overall, it is an entertaining game."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,Bottom line is this is the most realistic racing simulator (steering feel with a direct drive wheel) you can get today. I am a performance driving instructor and race endurance cars in real life and train with AMS2.
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"I've been playing AMS2 now since it was first released in early access. And boy let me tell you this whole year has been a journey!
I'm racing in real life for over 14 years. And never have I experienced a sim that comes so incredibly close to the real thing than AMS2. For example: the rain conditions. SPOT ON! I've raced a lot in the wet. And I love it. When I drove in AMS2 for the first time in the rain. I was blown away how realistic this is.

After some time I started in some leagues. I've found great friends from everywhere in the world that are really great guys to race with. And of course at some point I created my own league. So yesterday was the release of the Racin' USA pack. What we got is revolutionary for simracing! We have 42 years of weather data from every day on every track. If I want to drive in rainy Hockenheim 2019, sure, nothing is going to stop me. I can even use the weather from Imola 1988 for example. That. Is. Mind. Blowing!

Now onto the physics. Many people don't liked them before the update. But they'll gonna like it now. You feel like you are really there in the sim. In the car and on the track.
The Youtubers that don't even have a go casually in AMS2 are so wrong. 

And now after the update a lot of online lobbys are there that are full with drivers. I've hosted multiple servers today and I had on each server max 28 drivers. AMS2 is a new Standart in sim racing. This is the future. This sim is done by a incredibly small team with a very limited budget. But look what it's become. It's become the best sim there ever was. And I've played them all!"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"This is by far and away the most underappreciated sim out there! I have been playing this almost exclusively for the past few months. The FFB (with custom RFuktor file) is as good as anything else on the market. Don't believe everything you see/ read about AMS2. IT IS NOT A SIMCADE. THE FFB IS NOT CRAP. IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE PC2 (in-game). THE MADNESS ENGINE IS NOT ARCADEY. 

THIS GAME HAS THE BEST BASE GRAPHICS OF ANY SIM OUT THERE (INCLUDING ACC), THIS GAME HAS THE BEST WEATHER EFFECTS. IT HAS A GREAT TYRE MODEL. MOST CARS DRIVE BRILLIANTLY OUT THE BOX BUT THERE IS PLENTY OF REALISTIC CUSTOMISATION THAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE CARS.

Everything about this game is shaping up for me. We are merely half way through the development cycle. I cannot wait to see where this game will be a year from now."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"You MUST try this game. I cannot overstate this.. I'm starting with that, because I really think (if you came here to check it out), you won't be disappointed. You have nothing to lose. Give it a 2 hour try. You won't return it.
I know that there are many opinions about this game. I've heard about low numbers in multiplayer, the game is still in development, etc.. Sure, Reiza is still updating and improving this game. Bugs still exist.. fine.. 
But.. if you enjoy racing simulators, are tired of having to mod the heck out of AC just to get it to look like there is weather, if you want more than the same F1 20xx year after year, if you want a racing simulator that has just about every type of vehicle, from all different racing era's (1960s to modern), you owe it to yourself to give this a try.
The variety of race vehicles is mind boggling. And every vehicle has its own sound, its own feel. Try a kart similar to what you will find at your local kart racing track.. the sound of the 2 cycle engine, the incredibly frustrating time delay to get it up to speed, it is all very realistic.. 
Cars:
The Formula 1 cars, from the 1960s era, into the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and modern ... it is crazy.. These are NOT just vehicles painted to look like they belong in a particular era. They sound and feel like you are in a real Formula 1 car from that era. Each one is unique, from the impossible to control 60s lightweight cars, to the whining engines of the 70s, to the turbos of the 80s, and into the modern cars.. each era, and each car, has its own feel and sound. They did not copy / paste these.
The GT series cars.. I can't even begin to describe how good these are.. if you're into modern GT racing, you have everything, GT3, GT4, GTE, ... take the Corvette out for a spin.. you will not believe the sound... 
I have never driven a real race car, only sims.. but the feeling of one of these when turning a corner, pushing the limit of slip... it just feels right, 
The ""alternative"" cars... there is so much here.. just so much.. from the 1970s era stock cars such as Opala, Chevette, .. just really cool cars that were raced in real life on local tracks in Brazil and South America. This is a world those of us in North America and the rest of the world seem to have missed.. it is a very dedicated racing community down there.. and AMS2 represents it well.
The tracks.. every track is .. simply better than what you will see in any other sim.. there are many historical tracks, which (based on the scenery) really make you FEEL like you are back in time.. no safer barriers, sometimes no walls lol.. everything along the track looks like the era you are in... 
The weather... you MUST try this game if not only for the weather. Real weather updates, or make your own. The way the weather progresses, the way the water on the track affects your car, how this all looks... no way to describe it.. try it... 
There is no way to describe, the sun setting in the west, when the rain stops, and the track is still partially wet, but the glimmer and reflection on the small patches of water on the tracks.. and as day turns from day to late afternoon... the shadows... darker in some spots... sun on the horizon.. simply beautiful.
The AI..
In my opinion, the AI is some of the best out there. They will fight you for position, not just go to sleep, but will race you fair. If you have a position going into a turn, they will typically back off.. but they will continue to push you.. again.. again.. they don't just give up.. so you will have your hands full for an entire race.
You can pit and let your teammate take over.. he/she will drive until you want them to come back in. 
So.. I saved the bad parts for the end, but these should not prevent you from trying this game!
Multiplayer: Still a lower player count. You can find, at any time, about 25 to 50 players online.. perhaps 1 or 2 races which have 10 players.. these numbers are increasing weekly. (I am an offline player so I don't care about these things).
Championship bugs. They offer a custom championship mode for offline players like me. It still has bugs (refueling not allowed, points not assigned correctly), but Reiza has been phenomenal in there diligence to fix issues, so there is no doubt in my mind that these will be fixed.
If you want a game that you don't have to do ANY mods to make it work, give this a try."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"Probably the greatest pretend race cars sim out there at the moment. Good tire model that really relies on a good setup rather than aiming to hit a certain pressure, good handling characteristics that rely on your ability to set up the car, great tuning options, lots of tracks, lots of cars. It handles well, and the rFuktor FFB addon is mandatory and fantastic. Probably the best feel I've gotten from any race sim.

I messed around with AMS2 when it first came out, and it felt uncomplete to me, kind of like it was missing a lot of stuff. I fiddled around with various cars at various tracks, particularly the BMW Procar at Suzuka. But it felt off, and I simply waited for the updates to settle down a bit. Then 1.2 came out recently so I got back into it. Imagine my surprise when I spent the next 6 hours fiddling around with the Procar and the 2020 Brazil Stock Car and had an absolute blast. The tweaking of parameters is so much more intuitive and responsive than in other games, and can make an awful beast turn into a docile and fast race car. I've had a lot of fun so far and I think the game is finally in a state to recommend.

The game is very setup-dependent. You NEED to tweak the cars a bit in order to get them just right and fun to drive. But it doesn't take long! Maybe 30 minutes of practice at most. There's a great series by Steelcast/Steelreserve on Youtube and it's also linked in the Guides section on Steam. Highly recommend that too.

Great game and sim. Heartily recommend especially since it's come such a long way in the last year. Support small devs!"
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"+Total sim; driving feels correct
+Great rain effects and tire wear and feedback you can feel through your racing wheel
+Visually solid
+Many unique cars/vehicles not found in other sims
+Plenty of unique real-world tracks not found in other sims
+An overkill of options/settings
+No single-player progression; come ready

-Presentation lacking; bare-bones
-Missing many cars found in most other racing sims
-No ""default"" option after messing around with settings
-Triple screen setup has many options, but unintuitive (might take some effort to get it right)
-No achievements
-No traditional/typical single-player career mode (what's there is basically a create-your-own-championship mode)
-No single-player progression; come ready

=====================================

There's really no game here.   It's a simulator."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"AMS 2 is phenomenal. I own basically every sim game you can think of, and this is still one of the best IMO. Is it 100% hardcore real? No. Its like 90% real in terms of physics. You'll notice that it's slightly easier to corner in this game compared to other sims, but it's negligible. Maybe I'll just do a list of pros and cons or something to make this an efficient review for others to go over. 

(A quick note. This is NOT PC2 just slightly changed and reskinned. AMS 2 is completely different except for a few UI things.)

Pros:

-Best FFB hands down. It just feels right in every single way!
-Best VR experience. It's just flawless and never stutters or skips.
-Best graphics. The sky! The sky when transitioning between day and night is unlike any other sim.
-Racing with friends. This is THE EASIEST game to setup a multiplayer room for you & your friends.
-UI. The UI is intuitive and easy to understand.
-Free content constantly added.
-Frequent updates (Debatable whether a pro or con)

Cons:

-The AI. JFC the AI are dumb. They will run right through you causing you to crash, hold you up, block you like crazy, etc. No other AI infuriates me as much as the AMS 2 AI. The AI makes me crash 10x more than any other sim I own. As a note, I play at 106 Skill and 50 Aggression atm.
-Still a lot of little annoying bugs that can ruin the experience at times.
-Still lacking customization, but that's a moot point.
-Some of the content you may want in a sim simply isn't here because its more Brazilian focused. There's a big BUT here though because new content that most other sims have is constantly being added (Look at GT3, GTE, and DPi to name a few)

Those are the pros and cons that I can come up with atm. Would I recommend this game? Yes! I recommend this sim to every single person that is into sim racing. Just buy it and see what I mean. This will remain one of my favorite sims for the next 10 years at least."
Automobilista 2,Sports,1066890,"The cars feel and look amazing, the tracks are incredible, it performs flawlessly (especially in VR), and it's constantly being updated - what more could you possibly want? 

The only things that could make this better for me is more LMP1 cars (an Audi R18 or Porsche 919 would literally make this 10/10 for me) and more lights at night (Nurburgring could do with some spectator activity like campfires and neon lights just to give it that appropriate feel).

Keep up the amazing work!"

Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"This is a unique air hockey inspired game. The gameplay is fun. The characters are amusing. It is apparent there is much replay value to this game.
The gameplay is great. Each opponent you face off against has a special shot they perform once powered up. The opponents you face in the beginning don't have very tricky shots but the shots of later opponents are very intense and hard to combat. You can play a variety of modes against each opponent. There is a simple duel mode in which you battle your opponent up to a certain amount of points. There is also a bet mode in which you can bet up to a set number of coins on the match. A survival mode is also available where one strike against you results in the game being over.
The unlock system adds complexity to the game. Mallets and pucks of varying abilities are able to be unlocked. In fact you can unlock the mallets your opponents use to unlock their shots. There is also a leveling system in which you unlock different coin boosts for the particular modes.
A couple minors gripes I have are the lack of multiplayer and some annoying quirks of the characters. When you score on characters they perform the same action upon every point you win against them. So their catchphrases can get old quickly. However, you can just play a different character upon getting too annoyed.
Overall this game surprised me with how fun it is and I feel I will be sinking many hours into it."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is a great animated 3D air hockey game.  The game is controlled via the computer’s mouse. You have to hit a hockey puck with the aim to knock the hockey puck past the opponent’s site (and to get the puck when the opponent knocks it to you). In Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe you have a modern, colorfull design, 13 opponents on 5 floors (with different looking rooms), more than 40 gadgets and equipment and and and. This game is perfect if you just want to play a bit alone. The game saves itself so you have nothing to do when you want to quit the game. You can level your own character (about 200 levels!) and there are over 350 missions and 120 mini quests you can do. If you really want to collect all achievements and to do all quests you can spend much time on that game. I would buy it always again."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"I used to play Shufflepuck Cafe on the Atari ST, back in the 1980's. This is a lovely recreation, with loads of new features to explain exactly why you're playing shufflepuck against a motley assortment of aliens and robots."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"An OK little game to remember the original game from the nineties with some flaws that cannot be overlooked.

Clearly designed originally as a free-to-play (an insame amount of challenges, in-game achievements requiring 50+ hours of gameplay and more than a thousand matches to win, different sort of currencies, XP, slot machine, etc...), these mechanisms only strenghten the impression of a lack of content.

Which is sad, because the grinding slowly kills a game that had good efforts put into it (there's decent writing, overall good controls, balanced AI). This should be a lesson to game designers: forcing the player to put more hours than he normally would have only makes him/her notice the little things that are wrong (repetitive sound design, aberrant mallet behaviour on some occasions, too many menus...).

If you are bent on 100%ing games, just don't buy this one, the time you will have to spend is not worth it. For the others who might enjoy a few arcade air hockey matches, you can spend a few bucks when the game is on sale."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"******UPDATED******
After more hours into the game and all floors unlocked I have to say the game becones unfair with ai using their powers as much as they like and to get any thing is a major grind. I am talking about Star Wars Force Collection grind, I would hate to see the f2p mobile version. Sadly I can not recommend due to those things.

Do you like pong? Do you like Star Wars? If you answered yes to both then this game is for you! Though not set in the Star Wars universe the universe you are in is very Star Warsy even down to the cantina music. It's got a cute charm to it. 

Before you dive into the trenches of this game be warned first, this was originally a phone game that was free to play with in app purchases. No no, there are no IAP here, you buy the game once and that's it, but you can tell because you have to grind and grind and grind to get anything. 

The graphics really surprised me knowing that this is a mobile game, though it could use a little AA, it's very pleasing to the eyes. The music is hit or miss after hours of grinding your better off playing your own. The matches are short and sweet lasting only a minute or so but they are fun. You can unlock different power ups and upgrade your paddles and puck slightly. The only thing missing from this game is online play, that would be a blast to play your buddy in a pong like game."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"This is a port of an iOS free-to-play-with-microtransactions game.  It seems that the only thing that has been changed is that the microtransactions have been removed.  I wanted to relive my Shufflepuck Cafe days, not have to grind for hours to get the different types of currency needed to buy upgrades and new levels.  The game looks and plays well enough, but it's so obviously a port of a microtransaction-laden game that I just can't recommend it until the devs cut out some of the ridiculous grinding."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Normally being a fan of more action-like games or even shooters, I am surprised of how much this game draws me in. The characters are interesting and way more multidimensional than characters in other games that are supposed to be ""main heroes"", the gameplay itself is fluid, fun, and there are a lot of things to earn and rewards to get that will keep you going.

I can't recommend this game enough and I am surprised how much I like it, given how it was a ""curiosity-buy"". I am not disappointed :)

Buy this."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Sufflepuck Cantina is a cute little casual game about air hockey simulation, ideal for playing in small doses. What it does it does perfectly with a smooth mouse response and clear and intuitive controls.

Long story short, you play as an astronaut stranded in a distant planet inhabited by a bunch of freaks obsessed with air hockey. In order to get them help you to fix your broken spaceship you need to make youself a name as an air jockey player and beat (a looot of times) the 13 opponents. You start with a basic mallet and puck and the 3 beginner opponents, and you must grind your way up to the rest of them, their special mallets and pucks and some other unblockables, such as concept art, pieces of background for the diffferent characters, etc. Each enemy has their own mallet and puck and a special move, but the concept of the game is always the same.

Some people have said it resembles Star Wars Tatooine cantina aesthetics, and it does indeed. There's even a ""Twi'lek"" girl and a guy cosplayed as Han Solo, and every alien is very Star Warsy, so if you like the saga then you'll probably find Sufflepuck Cantina attractive to the eye. Most defining trait is the grinding, which many people have complained about; there's no ingame purchases inherited from its former app game nature, yet you will need tons of ingame currency to buy everything, from access to more challenging enemies to new mallets and its upgrades. As there are only 13 enemies and the only mechanics in the game are the short, intense air hockey matches (no other minigames included), this may get repetitive after a while. You can, however, buy your classic coin doubler upgrade, which I recommend you to do first thing (there are a couple upgrades for the puck to give you money when it hits the table and the mallet).

Also the lack of multiplayer really damages a game like this one, which could use it to add some replayability and extra fun. However, the developers are considering to add it in the future if they get funding, and you can read about it in the Steam forums. I had this game on a bundle so I will definitely be investing a couple bucks :p 

+ Cute design and characters
+ Addictive and tons of unlockable content
+ Polished and responsive controls and puck behavior

+/- Some people may find the grinding annoying, while others (like me) may find it catchy

- The concept gets repetitive quickly
- No multiplayer (although it could have it eventually)
- Some will find 10€ is a bit pricey due to lack of variety

Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"[TL;DR -- An unexpectedly addictive and beautifully presented game, well worth the $7.99-$9.99 USD price-point in my humble opinion.]

Though not a regular player of Arcade games, I thought I would make a foray into the genre when I picked up the newly-released Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe (SCD) for $7.99 USD. The game consists of playing Shufflepuck (essentially air hockey) against a series of increasingly challenging opponents to win points and money (known as ‘Credz’), ultimately in order to build a new spaceship to return home to Earth. Although a fairly simple premise, the game mechanics are well executed, and the opponents are sufficiently diverse to keep the game interesting and fresh as you progress.

The game takes place in a five-level Cantina, where Shufflepuck is the key form of entertainment for patrons. The graphics are crisp and polished, with each area of the Cantina having its own style. There are indeed no loading times, and the player can seamlessly travel between each level of the Cantina via an elevator. Four of the levels are populated by three opponent characters each (with the fifth level devoted to a single ‘Boss’ opponent), as well as bystanders and props. The activity in each area is sufficient to bring the game to life, but is subtle so as to not distract the player.

Each of the 12 regular opponents have unique mallets and pucks, as well as unique ‘special moves’, which the player is able to obtain and use as they progress through the game. The different special moves employed by each opponent adds greatly to the challenge of the game, as the player must adapt quickly to avoid defeat, particularly when required to face a series of different foes in attempting to complete each character’s ‘mini-quests’. The Shufflepuck matches are challenging, particularly those which require the player to concede no points over the course of the match. There’s a genuine sense of achievement in a flawless 15-0 victory against a difficult opponent.

As the player progresses, more points and Credz are amassed, as well as Tokens. Points are used to determine the player’s Level, which provides bonuses, as well as to rank the player amongst their friends and the global playerbase. Credz are used to purchase items from the Store, such as puck and mallet improvements, as well as the biography of each opponent character. Tokens can be exchanged for points or Credz via a ‘prize machine’, which involves a random-chance card-flipping interface akin to a slot machine, and may be subject to bonuses derived from your Level. 

The character biographies are well thought-out and consistent, and provide a back-story to the player to explain some of the feuds between characters the player will notice during the game. SCD does not have a narrative or story arc in the way that many FPS or RPG games do, however the character dialogue and biographies do a good job of filling that void, bearing in mind the context of an Arcade game.

All-in-all, I am very happy with my purchase and got a solid 20 hours of entertainment before finishing the core game missions. No doubt it would require many more hours to achieve 100% completion. The game is executed to a standard well above what I expected, indeed well above what I would expect of any new 3D game at the $9.99 USD or below price-point from an independent game developer. 

I would recommend to all, but particularly those who are fond of Arcade games. This game is fun, challenging and accessible, and at less than 100MB download, you’ll be able to jump into it almost immediately."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"So this was originally sold as ""Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe VR"" with Oculus DK2 support. And I played it for few hours in VR, pretty fun.
But Steam still suggests that VR title in name to buy that as gift for a friend.

False advertising and possibly removed VR headset support? I suppose it MIGHT work with DK2 on out-of-date DK2 drivers but can't confirm since I'm currently using Vive.

Thumbs down.

Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"This is a unique air hockey inspired game. The gameplay is fun. The characters are amusing. It is apparent there is much replay value to this game.
The gameplay is great. Each opponent you face off against has a special shot they perform once powered up. The opponents you face in the beginning don't have very tricky shots but the shots of later opponents are very intense and hard to combat. You can play a variety of modes against each opponent. There is a simple duel mode in which you battle your opponent up to a certain amount of points. There is also a bet mode in which you can bet up to a set number of coins on the match. A survival mode is also available where one strike against you results in the game being over.
The unlock system adds complexity to the game. Mallets and pucks of varying abilities are able to be unlocked. In fact you can unlock the mallets your opponents use to unlock their shots. There is also a leveling system in which you unlock different coin boosts for the particular modes.
A couple minors gripes I have are the lack of multiplayer and some annoying quirks of the characters. When you score on characters they perform the same action upon every point you win against them. So their catchphrases can get old quickly. However, you can just play a different character upon getting too annoyed.
Overall this game surprised me with how fun it is and I feel I will be sinking many hours into it."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is a great animated 3D air hockey game.  The game is controlled via the computer’s mouse. You have to hit a hockey puck with the aim to knock the hockey puck past the opponent’s site (and to get the puck when the opponent knocks it to you). In Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe you have a modern, colorfull design, 13 opponents on 5 floors (with different looking rooms), more than 40 gadgets and equipment and and and. This game is perfect if you just want to play a bit alone. The game saves itself so you have nothing to do when you want to quit the game. You can level your own character (about 200 levels!) and there are over 350 missions and 120 mini quests you can do. If you really want to collect all achievements and to do all quests you can spend much time on that game. I would buy it always again."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"I used to play Shufflepuck Cafe on the Atari ST, back in the 1980's. This is a lovely recreation, with loads of new features to explain exactly why you're playing shufflepuck against a motley assortment of aliens and robots."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"An OK little game to remember the original game from the nineties with some flaws that cannot be overlooked.

Clearly designed originally as a free-to-play (an insame amount of challenges, in-game achievements requiring 50+ hours of gameplay and more than a thousand matches to win, different sort of currencies, XP, slot machine, etc...), these mechanisms only strenghten the impression of a lack of content.

Which is sad, because the grinding slowly kills a game that had good efforts put into it (there's decent writing, overall good controls, balanced AI). This should be a lesson to game designers: forcing the player to put more hours than he normally would have only makes him/her notice the little things that are wrong (repetitive sound design, aberrant mallet behaviour on some occasions, too many menus...).

If you are bent on 100%ing games, just don't buy this one, the time you will have to spend is not worth it. For the others who might enjoy a few arcade air hockey matches, you can spend a few bucks when the game is on sale."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"******UPDATED******
After more hours into the game and all floors unlocked I have to say the game becones unfair with ai using their powers as much as they like and to get any thing is a major grind. I am talking about Star Wars Force Collection grind, I would hate to see the f2p mobile version. Sadly I can not recommend due to those things.

Do you like pong? Do you like Star Wars? If you answered yes to both then this game is for you! Though not set in the Star Wars universe the universe you are in is very Star Warsy even down to the cantina music. It's got a cute charm to it. 

Before you dive into the trenches of this game be warned first, this was originally a phone game that was free to play with in app purchases. No no, there are no IAP here, you buy the game once and that's it, but you can tell because you have to grind and grind and grind to get anything. 

The graphics really surprised me knowing that this is a mobile game, though it could use a little AA, it's very pleasing to the eyes. The music is hit or miss after hours of grinding your better off playing your own. The matches are short and sweet lasting only a minute or so but they are fun. You can unlock different power ups and upgrade your paddles and puck slightly. The only thing missing from this game is online play, that would be a blast to play your buddy in a pong like game."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"This is a port of an iOS free-to-play-with-microtransactions game.  It seems that the only thing that has been changed is that the microtransactions have been removed.  I wanted to relive my Shufflepuck Cafe days, not have to grind for hours to get the different types of currency needed to buy upgrades and new levels.  The game looks and plays well enough, but it's so obviously a port of a microtransaction-laden game that I just can't recommend it until the devs cut out some of the ridiculous grinding."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Normally being a fan of more action-like games or even shooters, I am surprised of how much this game draws me in. The characters are interesting and way more multidimensional than characters in other games that are supposed to be ""main heroes"", the gameplay itself is fluid, fun, and there are a lot of things to earn and rewards to get that will keep you going.

I can't recommend this game enough and I am surprised how much I like it, given how it was a ""curiosity-buy"". I am not disappointed :)

Buy this."
Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,Sports,259510,"Sufflepuck Cantina is a cute little casual game about air hockey simulation, ideal for playing in small doses. What it does it does perfectly with a smooth mouse response and clear and intuitive controls.

Long story short, you play as an astronaut stranded in a distant planet inhabited by a bunch of freaks obsessed with air hockey. In order to get them help you to fix your broken spaceship you need to make youself a name as an air jockey player and beat (a looot of times) the 13 opponents. You start with a basic mallet and puck and the 3 beginner opponents, and you must grind your way up to the rest of them, their special mallets and pucks and some other unblockables, such as concept art, pieces of background for the diffferent characters, etc. Each enemy has their own mallet and puck and a special move, but the concept of the game is always the same.

Some people have said it resembles Star Wars Tatooine cantina aesthetics, and it does indeed. There's even a ""Twi'lek"" girl and a guy cosplayed as Han Solo, and every alien is very Star Warsy, so if you like the saga then you'll probably find Sufflepuck Cantina attractive to the eye. Most defining trait is the grinding, which many people have complained about; there's no ingame purchases inherited from its former app game nature, yet you will need tons of ingame currency to buy everything, from access to more challenging enemies to new mallets and its upgrades. As there are only 13 enemies and the only mechanics in the game are the short, intense air hockey matches (no other minigames included), this may get repetitive after a while. You can, however, buy your classic coin doubler upgrade, which I recommend you to do first thing (there are a couple upgrades for the puck to give you money when it hits the table and the mallet).

Also the lack of multiplayer really damages a game like this one, which could use it to add some replayability and extra fun. However, the developers are considering to add it in the future if they get funding, and you can read about it in the Steam forums. I had this game on a bundle so I will definitely be investing a couple bucks :p 

+ Cute design and characters
+ Addictive and tons of unlockable content
+ Polished and responsive controls and puck behavior

+/- Some people may find the grinding annoying, while others (like me) may find it catchy

- The concept gets repetitive quickly
- No multiplayer (although it could have it eventually)
- Some will find 10€ is a bit pricey due to lack of variety

After playing for 6 or 7 hours I say it's a good game, fun and with a fair amount of content, but it can get old quickly. If, like me, you are a sucker for casual games and achievement hunting, you will sure enjoy it. If you are looking for a more hardcore game, I would advice to avoid this one, specially at full price, as some will consider it to be a bit too much for what it offers; I had it in a bundle though, so I am more than happy with the value.

Dota 2,Strategy,570,"I've spent 10 years and almost 10,000 hours playing Warcraft III DotA as well as Dota 2, and loved playing it. I've met many interesting people, fought epic battles, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat through several Herculean efforts, endured many soul crushing defeats, and even clashed with a handful of professional players. The game has changed drastically over my many years of playing, but as of about a year ago, the game became too frustrating to continue, and as I continue to watch, I am saddened by what the game has become.

For years my friends and I have joked about the ""League-ification"" of Dota. Dota has always been the epitome of hyper competitive cooperative gameplay, with a high emphasis on individual skill and decision making at all phases of the game, especially in punishing poor decisions. Pushing a tower alone with nobody showing on the map? Get back or you're dead. Hard carry dies past 40 minutes without buyback? That's a barracks down. Pick crappy laning heroes? Welcome to hell while the enemy team runs a trilane and pushes barracks at 20 minutes.

Our jokes slowly but surely became a reality. Teleport scrolls were reduced in cost, meaning everybody rolled around with a handful because they weren't a financial burden. Ways to gain gold were increased, so supports could afford to have a handful of items in the mid game. The rubber band effect was introduced, and pushing strategies were neutered. You pick a lineup to take towers and take one unfavorable engagement and the game's over, whereas previously the greedier lineup would have to do more work than a single fight to overcome the gold advantage. The cost of boots was reduced, taking boots first strategies from a sure sign that you were bad to a viable strategy. Strong laners also got pushed out. Dominating the early game became effectively irrelevant as killing giant money bag heroes in the midgame would slingshot the trailing team into the lead.

The worst casualty has been the versatility of the game. Metas change and stuff goes in and out of favor, that's fine and fair, but certain aspects have become imperative to have. A support with a hard save, a hard carry that can fight in the early mid game. Bad laning heroes can just be sent mid, while traditional skill mid heroes are just sent to the safelane. When you take a big lead, the plan is almost always just farm out the map until you can't possibly lose when taking the high ground, as taking a risk will not just result in you losing a fight, but most likely the lead.

The game that I grew up with that punishes the smallest mistakes is a distant memory, and we are left with a mid game brawler. I wish Dota 2 the best as it progresses, but the core mechanics have been changed so drastically that I can neither play nor watch it without feeling like something that was once an unrelenting niche game has been formed to cater to the whims of the massive casual audience that it has attracted."
Dota 2,Strategy,570,Still cant figure out how to jump.
Dota 2,Strategy,570,-25/10

The game has changed drastically over my many years of playing, but as of about a year ago, the game became too frustrating to continue, and as I continue to watch, I am saddened by what the game has become.

For years my friends and I have joked about the ""League-ification"" of Dota. Dota has always been the epitome of hyper competitive cooperative gameplay, with a high emphasis on individual skill and decision making at all phases of the game, especially in punishing poor decisions. Pushing a tower alone with nobody showing on the map? Get back or you're dead. Hard carry dies past 40 minutes without buyback? That's a barracks down. Pick crappy laning heroes? Welcome to hell while the enemy team runs a trilane and pushes barracks at 20 minutes.

Our jokes slowly but surely became a reality. Teleport scrolls were reduced in cost, meaning everybody rolled around with a handful because they weren't a financial burden. Ways to gain gold were increased, so supports could afford to have a handful of items in the mid game. The rubber band effect was introduced, and pushing strategies were neutered. You pick a lineup to take towers and take one unfavorable engagement and the game's over, whereas previously the greedier lineup would have to do more work than a single fight to overcome the gold advantage. The cost of boots was reduced, taking boots first strategies from a sure sign that you were bad to a viable strategy. Strong laners also got pushed out. Dominating the early game became effectively irrelevant as killing giant money bag heroes in the midgame would slingshot the trailing team into the lead.

The worst casualty has been the versatility of the game. Metas change and stuff goes in and out of favor, that's fine and fair, but certain aspects have become imperative to have. A support with a hard save, a hard carry that can fight in the early mid game. Bad laning heroes can just be sent mid, while traditional skill mid heroes are just sent to the safelane. When you take a big lead, the plan is almost always just farm out the map until you can't possibly lose when taking the high ground, as taking a risk will not just result in you losing a fight, but most likely the lead.

The game that I grew up with that punishes the smallest mistakes is a distant memory, and we are left with a mid game brawler. I wish Dota 2 the best as it progresses, but the core mechanics have been changed so drastically that I can neither play nor watch it without feeling like something that was once an unrelenting niche game has been formed to cater to the whims of the massive casual audience that it has attracted."
Dota 2,Strategy,570,Still cant figure out how to jump.
Dota 2,Strategy,570,-25/10
Dota 2,Strategy,570,"A game that truly grasps the idea of helping those in dire need to escape their reality.
After allowing peru to play on our servers, and bought accounts in 4-6k. This game has truly made a better place to find friends of South America, and help people fully understand the hardships and struggles these people go through by having feeding South Americans only play Pos 1-2 or jungle. It opened up a world of hard working, can collecting children to gather change and be fortunate enough to play at their internet cafe's and flood US West/East. God Bless them.

Very thankful for the open-mindedness of Valve and their appreciation of ""Peru Lives Matter.""

Many of my fondest memories with this game were playing multiplayer matches with my friends, many of whom have the game on Mac. Sadly that is no longer possible :("
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,Looking at this makes me happy
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,"This game is my favorite out of all the Sid Meier's Civ series. Not only is the DLC great, but the community and workshop around this game is phenomenal. The base game is fun, challenging, and replayability is through the roof. You can come back again and again to this game and never get bored because something new always happens! The DLC is amazing too though! You can get different scenario packs, religions, or entirely new civs that will all add new elements that force you to rethink your approaches to winning your desired victory for the game. Lastly, there is a spectacular mod community for this game that can allow you to do thing you never thought could happen in civ. From ""waifu civs"" to skyrim and LOTR, there is literally a mod in the workshop for everything.

That being said, the base game alone is well worth the money, but taking into account the workshop community, the DLC, and replayability, you should definitely buy this game. This game has it's place in every persons library."
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,cool
Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,"Before people react to my thumbs down score, hold on a moment, and read the review - I explain it a bit at the end. (Honestly, this is another case where I wish Steam had a ""meh"" option.)

I've played Civilization since I was a kid. I remember wasting hours with Civ2, as well as playing the sci-fi and fantasy spin offs of it. (Anybody else remember those?) I played with Civ3, and played the heck out of Civ4. When I got around to doing Civ5, I was initially underwhelmed, but came back to it after some of the DLC went on sale. After playing it a bit more, what do I think?

Honestly, I still feel a bit underwhelmed. But here's the thing... it's not a BAD game. It certainly doesn't have the serious balance issues that Civ3 had. (I still remember medieval knights destroying modern tanks.) The leader animations are nice and smooth and less cartoony than you find in Civ4 (or even Civ6). However, after being wowed with all the different things I could do with Civ4, I would expect a lot more of this to be available in Civ5. I still remember in Civ4 sending missionaries to spread my religion in neighboring lands, upping my culture boosts, then watching as cities rebelled against their governments to join me. I can't do much like that in Civ5. Heck, even Civ2 offered a lot more - I loved it in Civ2 when I would capture the capital of an enemy nation and watch them descend into a civil war. Compared to Civ2, Civ5 feels really basic. A lot of times, I'm just sitting there, clicking on the ""Next Turn"" button because there's very little else for me to do other than wait for either something to be built or something to get researched. Why did they remove so much that made Civ4 so much more immersive?

Like I said, it's not a bad game in terms of bugs, core gameplay, graphics etc. So why did I say ""no"" to the question of ""do you recommend this game""? Because when you look down the line of Civilization titles, I just can't recommend this game above it the other titles. Honestly, I haven't even thought of bothering with Civ6 if this is the trend in the series. I feel like the Civilization games might as well be called ""Graphics Card Update 6"", because about all they are. Civ4 still holds up for me after all this time, and if anyone is curious about which game in the Civilization series to start with, I would recommend this. I would not suggest investing in Civ5 unless it's either on sale or you're such a die-hard fan that you just GOTTA have them all."

Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,"also ik that this is so long it might as well be a book. im just using one of my past expieriences to give you an idea how the average civ game works. no game of civilization is ever the same!

-picks chieftan (cuz I'm bad at the game)
-picks america
-spawns as the only civilization on the continent (although I'd say island would be a better term)
-after colonizing the entire island and taking advantage of all the resources i research sailing so i dont have to be so isolated.
-I meet the Siamese
-I meet the Ottomans
-I meet the Russians
-I decide to take advantage of the new found resources and start a settlement.
-The city of Choccolocco is founded!
-i decide to go for a scientific victory
-The Siamese asked if they could be friends. Of course i accepted
-a few turns later and Russia wanted to be friends. i accepted. little did I know I would regret making friends with both these people....
-The Siamese asked if I wanted to go to war with the Ottomans. i said ""ten turns. give me ten turns then we'll talk.""
-in these ten turns i assembled every nearby military unit in the area and created a military of...2 swordsman. (the production in choccolocco was low at the time, mind you. it was a new settlement.)
-The time for war has come. i moved my 2 swordsmen straight to the one and only city of Istanbul. I attacked them...and they took out one of my men and the other one retreated.
-help
-i waited for the siamese to arrive, but they didnt come. for a second i thought that the siamese may abandon me.
-but then, when things were at there worst, the siamese came.
-and oh did they come. siamese armies came from all sides!
-but even that wasnt enough.
-thankfully the army kept the enemy busy while i built a navy and got them to the ottoman capital.
-it was fairly obvious that the siamese army wasnt enough to defeat the capital and the...ONE ARCHER. the capital and that one archer was fending off multiple armies.
-but it didnt matter. by the time the last of the siamese armies began to retreat, i had researched mathmatics and had a catapult! combine that with my navy, and I had totally won.
-my swordsman dealt the finishing blow and Istanbul was now an american city.
-the Siamese thanked me for helping them eliminate the ottomans.
-decided to focus on building up my already flourishing economy.
-then, out of nowhere, Russia declared war on the Siamese!
-at the time i was friends with both.
-both of them expected me to take there side in the war. 
-if i didnt take any side in the war, both of them will denounce me for not helping them when at war.
-if i choose a side the other will hate me and others will denounce me for betraying a friend.
-help
-i sent a scout to explore and they found a new continent AND the aztecs
-after getting an open borders agreement with the aztecs the scout explored the land and discovered that the aztecs pretty much owned the entire continent
-so colonizing that continent without going to war is outta the question....
-I found out that the aztecs dont ENTIRELY own the land. Egypt owns a single city. 
-egypt also denounced me and called me a warmongering menace because i helped a friend in need.
-well hello to you too.
-I pay Russia to make peace with the Siamese
-Me and siamese make a defensive pact
-both sides get mad at me for not helping in the war
-they still seem pretty friendly towards me tho
-Russia declares war on the Siamese
-this time i dont really have a choice but to declare war on Russia...
-luckily the city with most of the military is right near a russian city
-i attack the city
-i do most of the work
-at the end the siamese swooped in and stole the city
-WHAT THE HECK RAMKHAMHAENG?!
-i decided that it was only fair that he got the city after i got the other city in the last war we had
-since most of the units i had was killed, and i wanted to focus on my economy, i made peace with russia and eventually convinced her to make peace with the siamese
-i decided not to go into any more defensive pacts since the siamese and russia couldnt get along and this clearly wouldnt be the last war they'd have
-I also got a great scientist and decided to save him for the end
-the aztecs declare war upon egypt
-i feel sorry for egypt
-i ask russia and siam if they wanna help
-they say yes
-we go straight to the capital
-then I realize that the aztecs have plenty of time to get units to the shore while we sail across the ocean
-they decimate our armies before they even get close to the capital
-he sends all his units and attacks our continent
-he destroys egypt
-he attacks everyone
-russia makes peace and then declares war on me
-siam does too
-WHAT THE HECK RUSSIA AND SIAM?!?!
-though my units were more advanced, they were outnumbered my units
-they take istanbul
-they take choccolocco
-they sail to my continent and takes all cities except for washington
-i prepared for this and had an army ready
-i begged for peace but they refused
-i offered my smaller island bound cities
-they declined
-the city of washington, on 1842 AD, was taken by siam, who was once my strongest ally and friend.

-America has fallen

so in conclusion...its a pretty good game."

Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,I liked it when the monkey armed itself with 5mm m60 military grade light machine gun and committed radical terrorism.
Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"this game has ruined my life, i go to a party and i am tormented and haunted by my past of popping bloons. i cannot be in the same room as a bloon as i have instant outbursts of rage and lunge at the bloons. would highly recommend."
Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"Apes alone weak...

Apes together strong."
Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"[h1]TLDR[/h1]
Bloons TD 6 is [i]the[/i] mick jagger of tower defense game. A little bit wacky, fun, unique style and definitely a jewel for TD gamers. 

[h1]Non-TLDR[/h1]
Bloons TD 6 (BTD 6), developed and published by Ninja Kiwi. The PC version was relased on Dec 17, 2018 and it is also available on the Iphone/Ipad. On Metacritic (https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bloons-td-6) it has:
[list]
    [*]0 Metascore from critic reviews
    [*]An average user score of 7.4 from 30 ratings
[/list]

If you've played Flash games before, you'd probably come across bloon td. if you are someone who loves tower defense games, you'd probably slay a ton of bloons before ninja kiwi (and other flash game developers) migrated to steam because Flash is no longer supported by Adobe. So these group of people have seen how bloon td evolved till today. 

As for the younger generations, this may seem like some wild, crazy, mess up monkey revenge business against balloons. Did i mention that it was also fun/can be frustrating at the same time?

[h1]Overview[/h1]
BTD 6 offers players 40 over maps to play. it comes in 3 difficulty and each difficulty has different set of challenges - that will test your skill and knowledge. For some odd reasons, BTD 6 has a complicated map system for online/co-op game play. 

[list]
    [*]You can't play online or co-op under the [u]standard[/u] ""play"" game. 
    [*]Daily challenges are strictly solo.
    [*]Co-op challenges can be played with friends/others over the internet.
    [*]Co-op can only be played in co-op maps.
    [*]There are 2 variations of co-op maps:
[olist]
    [*]Play the entire map
    [*]Play in 1 of the sections of the map
[/olist]
    [*]Other events/Challenges are strictly solo.
[/list]

Your towers have it's own leveling system. Aside from that, the more you play, you also gain up exp for your own account - this is the monkey knowledge system. As you level up, you gain monkey knowledge points which can be used to purchase ""perks"" for your towers or heroes tower. Yes, there are heroes tower which needs to be unlocked & purchased (not microtrans). If i am not mistaken, the first 2 heroes can be unlocked and given to you after you reach certain levels.

Other than all of the above, you now have:
[list]
    [*]Powers = non-towers that can be placed on to the map to assist you in various ways.
    [*]Insta towers = free towers that you have acquire through challenges/events. These towers come with certain upgrades already.
[/list]

On top of all of this, it has a trophy store, where you can purchase various in-game elements; visuals/ui/emoticons. Nothing that can affect the gameplay. You earn trophy from odyssey game mode. finally, it has a microtransaction shop.

BTD 6 isn't just your standard Tower Defense game with all this features.

[h1]Controls, Audio, Visuals[/h1]
Visuals: It's 3d'ish looking. colorful, clean. certain maps have objects to interact/block your line of sight. Monkeys and bloons have been properly designed. no complains. +1 to the team

Audio: Energetic vibe. I believe you can purchase additional soundtrack from the trophy store. (yet to try). There's a jukebox to enable. +1 to the team

Controls: Mouse. For more advanced/hardcore gamers, you can use keyboard keys.

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]
As a tower defense game, your goal is to prevent the bloons from exiting the map. If it does, your life will be deducted. Once you lose all of your life, the game ends. At this point, you can either replay from scratch or use monkey cash to re-try again. 

What makes BTD 6 complicated is the difficulty and what game mode you are playing on. A standard easy vs Deflation easy is 2 totally different game mode while they share the ""common"" easy rules. Same concept applies to the other difficulty/harder maps. 

On the surface it may seem like all the maps and bloons are the same. So, what exactly makes the game ""harder""?
The first criteria is the game mode which you are playing. It will set the tone on how hard/what sort of challenge you will be presented. (1 hp game, magicians tower only, reverse path, half cash etc)

The second criteria is the difficulty levels. On a general note, the higher difficulty you play, you will be required to play more levels. easy: 40 levels. medium 60. hard 80. you will encounter much harder bloon types (mix and match from various properties: camo, ceramic, metal, rainbow, regrow, FORTIFIED! etc). The bloon type is what dictates ""how hard the game"" will be. 

In order to beat hard maps, you will definitely need to max out your tower levels and invest into monkey knowledge. Heroes are not prominent until you start to play on hard maps or you have a particular way of playing/sync it with other towers.

The tower themselves are unique and depending on your style of play, you can mix and match certain tower styles. In this sense it gives flexibility to the players - some may opt of the ninja tower but others prefer the sniper. 

[h1]My personal thoughts/My Summary[/h1]
Bloon TD has come a long way. I wouldn't say BTD 6 has revolutionize tower defense games but it's certainly not your average tower defense. What makes it fun/challenging is the bloons. Knowing your enemy properties and spawn at which level will greatly increase the gameplay experience else its going to be bonkers.

40 over maps playing solo can feel repetitive and boring. On harder maps, where you are required to play 80 levels or more (more time spent) can be a turn off after xxx hours.

Going co-op, you will have to stick with the map layout and without a proper way to communicate, can turn the game into a messy monkey business. Spamming of emoticons that doesnt make sense. I dont voice chat unless i am playing with my friends. in other words, playing online with public you have to bare with the: 1) map layout (free for all or play in a section of the map), 2) communication limitation 3) knowledge of the person..and style of play
can lead to a [b][u]painful[/u][/b] experience. 

ever played in a co-op map where one of the player just build 1 tower in a hard game map? 
or leaves immediately once the game starts?
or mass tower hugging at the entrance? [b]vomits blood[/b]

On the other hand, if you are playing with knowledgeable people, you learn and have more fun. I wished there was a way to add them into your friend list. I would love to have more co-op maps that are free to play style than sections though.

So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Bloon TD 6 is a no-monkey business, creative coconut mess that is fun. An easy 8/10."

Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,It's alright.
Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"I want to start off this review by noting that I seldom played previous Bloons games apart from Bloons TD Battles. Due to this, as you can imagine, it was a little difficult to adapt to the games style in comparison to Battles, especially with the addition of heroes. However, this game has far surpassed all my expectations when I first purchased the game for only 99 cents. Despite thew extremely low cost, I have gotten an unprecedented amount of enjoyable gameplay, even in comparison to games that cost 20x as much. The gameplay is energetic, vibrant, and increasingly challenging in an incredibly fun way. The different monkeys all seem to be relatively balanced and the addition of three upgrade paths allows for an absurd amount of different unique play styles and setups. Every monkey has its own situational use you have to play the game to get more and more used to the different monkeys. The heroes mesh nicely with the game and the ranging difficulty of the maps allows for players to progress in skill at their own pace. On top of this, there are lots of cool community events and the game is even more of a blast when you play with friends. I would most certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and chill strategy game to play with your friends or solo."

Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"[h1]TLDR[/h1]
Bloons TD 6 is [i]the[/i] mick jagger of tower defense game. A little bit wacky, fun, unique style and definitely a jewel for TD gamers. 

[h1]Non-TLDR[/h1]
Bloons TD 6 (BTD 6), developed and published by Ninja Kiwi. The PC version was relased on Dec 17, 2018 and it is also available on the Iphone/Ipad. On Metacritic (https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bloons-td-6) it has:
[list]
    [*]0 Metascore from critic reviews
    [*]An average user score of 7.4 from 30 ratings
[/list]

If you've played Flash games before, you'd probably come across bloon td. if you are someone who loves tower defense games, you'd probably slay a ton of bloons before ninja kiwi (and other flash game developers) migrated to steam because Flash is no longer supported by Adobe. So these group of people have seen how bloon td evolved till today. 

As for the younger generations, this may seem like some wild, crazy, mess up monkey revenge business against balloons. Did i mention that it was also fun/can be frustrating at the same time?

[h1]Overview[/h1]
BTD 6 offers players 40 over maps to play. it comes in 3 difficulty and each difficulty has different set of challenges - that will test your skill and knowledge. For some odd reasons, BTD 6 has a complicated map system for online/co-op game play. 

[list]
    [*]You can't play online or co-op under the [u]standard[/u] ""play"" game. 
    [*]Daily challenges are strictly solo.
    [*]Co-op challenges can be played with friends/others over the internet.
    [*]Co-op can only be played in co-op maps.
    [*]There are 2 variations of co-op maps:
[olist]
    [*]Play the entire map
    [*]Play in 1 of the sections of the map
[/olist]
    [*]Other events/Challenges are strictly solo.
[/list]

Your towers have it's own leveling system. Aside from that, the more you play, you also gain up exp for your own account - this is the monkey knowledge system. As you level up, you gain monkey knowledge points which can be used to purchase ""perks"" for your towers or heroes tower. Yes, there are heroes tower which needs to be unlocked & purchased (not microtrans). If i am not mistaken, the first 2 heroes can be unlocked and given to you after you reach certain levels.

Other than all of the above, you now have:
[list]
    [*]Powers = non-towers that can be placed on to the map to assist you in various ways.
    [*]Insta towers = free towers that you have acquire through challenges/events. These towers come with certain upgrades already.
[/list]

On top of all of this, it has a trophy store, where you can purchase various in-game elements; visuals/ui/emoticons. Nothing that can affect the gameplay. You earn trophy from odyssey game mode. finally, it has a microtransaction shop.

BTD 6 isn't just your standard Tower Defense game with all this features.

[h1]Controls, Audio, Visuals[/h1]
Visuals: It's 3d'ish looking. colorful, clean. certain maps have objects to interact/block your line of sight. Monkeys and bloons have been properly designed. no complains. +1 to the team

Audio: Energetic vibe. I believe you can purchase additional soundtrack from the trophy store. (yet to try). There's a jukebox to enable. +1 to the team

Controls: Mouse. For more advanced/hardcore gamers, you can use keyboard keys.

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]
As a tower defense game, your goal is to prevent the bloons from exiting the map. If it does, your life will be deducted. Once you lose all of your life, the game ends. At this point, you can either replay from scratch or use monkey cash to re-try again. 

What makes BTD 6 complicated is the difficulty and what game mode you are playing on. A standard easy vs Deflation easy is 2 totally different game mode while they share the ""common"" easy rules. Same concept applies to the other difficulty/harder maps. 

On the surface it may seem like all the maps and bloons are the same. So, what exactly makes the game ""harder""?
The first criteria is the game mode which you are playing. It will set the tone on how hard/what sort of challenge you will be presented. (1 hp game, magicians tower only, reverse path, half cash etc)

The second criteria is the difficulty levels. On a general note, the higher difficulty you play, you will be required to play more levels. easy: 40 levels. medium 60. hard 80. you will encounter much harder bloon types (mix and match from various properties: camo, ceramic, metal, rainbow, regrow, FORTIFIED! etc). The bloon type is what dictates ""how hard the game"" will be. 

In order to beat hard maps, you will definitely need to max out your tower levels and invest into monkey knowledge. Heroes are not prominent until you start to play on hard maps or you have a particular way of playing/sync it with other towers.

The tower themselves are unique and depending on your style of play, you can mix and match certain tower styles. In this sense it gives flexibility to the players - some may opt of the ninja tower but others prefer the sniper.

Great game, addicting as hell and the fact that I got over 1000+ hours in the game in under a year should point to that. Mods just add more to the game and most of them are great and some are must haves. 11/10 would buy again.

What follows are semi coherent ramblings about the game, read at your own peril.

[spoiler]

Rimworld is infinitely replayable. You start with several scenarios that give you a varying amount of ""pawns"" (your slaves to do with you want), techlevels and resources. You can generate planets and modify said generation making planets tropical paradises, hellish deserts or frozen wastelands. When you get tired of the basic scenarios you can also make your own. Want your pawn(s) to start a drug addict and fight for survival while going through withdrawal? You can do that. Want your pawn(s) to be bionic super soldiers hell bent on destroying the planet.... that is possible too. You can play as wanderers or colonists or a mixture of both styles. And with the dev tools available ingame you can easily modify the game while you play it, putting even more chaos into the mix. You can do everything from spawning new pawns, animals and so on, to changing the weather, to making the map a peaceful paradise...... (sorry, the warcriminal in me cringed a bit).

Obviously you can play on peaceful and turn it into a game of building and designing colonies or to exploring the world. Or you can play on the highest difficulty with ironman enabled to challenge your skill, your nerves and most importantly: your luck. Here once again Rimworlds easy customizability comes into play, permitting you to tailor the difficulty to your prefered playstyle, even mid game. And once you get tired (not that that is possible) of the game, you can istall mods to change everything or very little. New species, more animals, better interfaces (RimHud be praised), new weapons, rebalances for practically everything in the game and mods that totally change the game or the setting.
Rimworld as I now understand it, is about making a story, about leading your pawns as good as you can so they might survive another day (or torturing them into insanity, turning them into drug addicts and cold blooded murders or harvesting their organs one by one). As one of the tooltips of the game says ""A destroyed colony is not a failure, it is a tradegy"" (didnt look it up so it probably isnt 100% accurate).

As you play all pawns (on the map) interact socially and build relationships and connections. Those relationships then influence their interactions and what they think of the others. These interactions as other interactions with the world influence their happiness (mood) which can, when it falls below a certain threshold, lead to mental breaks. These mental breaks are varied and can go from aimless wandering to muderous rage where the pawn wont stop until their target is dead or the are killed (or arrested). 


I wont go into the carfting, building or research but suffice to say there are many options to pick from, many choices to be made when crafting or building and plenty of research to be researched.

All these interactions give flavor to the the world and it inhabitants. It can happen that a family member of one of your pawns comes and visits you, peacefully or with the intention of destroying everything you have. Out of these interactions a story is crafted. (A certain mod makes these interactions more visible by giving your pawns speachbubbles so you can easily read how they interact.)
After I figured this out I stopped building absurd over the top bases and instead focused more on my pawns and fullfilling their needs and seeing how they interact. Back then I tended to have my speed at x3 so stuff got built faster, which lead to me missing practically all interactions and only being able to see the consequences. I now play on x1 most of the time and watch them go about their work, chatting, flirting or insulting the pawns they pass or share work space with. It is far more engaging then playing it as a rts or something similiar.

And the Royalty DLC adds many new things and several new playstyles
So yeah, worth every cent. This game gave me the best money to time spent ratio of all my games
Randy Random/10 would play again

RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Alright, I took my time and I think I finally have a good grasp on my thoughts about this game. I'll try to keep them short and to-the-point.

This is one of those games I've spent quite a bit more hours in than I'd like to admit. Not because the game is bad or embarrassing or anything -- it's because I feel a little bit weird about having so many games collecting dust in my library and then never ""finding the time or energy"" to even boot them, but then I have titles like rimworld that I've somehow found that ""time and energy"" in abundance.

On the surface the game seems either casual or overly complex, depending on which stage of playing it you are currently in. Before buying this game, it seemed casual (likely attributed to the art style) and after I finally clocked my first hour in, I had to admit it seemed a bit too complex for a simple man like me.

This is, however, just a charade. The game is neither casual nor overly complex. The game is very nicely balanced in its complexity and the generally great (although not very aesthetically pleasing) GUI plays a big part in that. 

Now, my experience has been enhanced by mods from the very beginning. My very first (short-lived) playthrough was entirely vanilla, but as with most games, I quickly checked out the mods and just couldn't stop myself.

The best part of this game is the modding community and all the awesome mods that we've had the pleasure to play with and experience. And I'm not even exaggerating that. It's absolutely amazing how much variety and even very specific little things we have. And there's no lack of absolutely gigantic mods with entirely new, complex and well-balanced mechanics. This is one of those games that actually benefit greatly from mods, and it has been developed in a way to make this possible. This is a very mod-friendly title and that is always a complete treat.

Once you get a grasp on the mechanics and what the game is about, it's an endless hole to throw your time in. It's even worse than civ in this regard, even if civ has the iconic ""one more turn"" phrase attached to it. And I shouldn't use the word ""worse"" -- it is indeed better for it.

I've never managed to get anywhere close to building the ship that seems to be the ultimate goal for this game. But I've never even cared for ending the game honestly. All of my games, except for the first two more serious attempts, have been tribal starts with mods that make it a true ""start from the ancient times and slowly build up"" experience. I love the game in this form -- you start with barely enough technology to survive the first winter, and even if it is technically enough, it often turns out to be tricky to manage. The technologies advance so slow it plays no big part in this first huge problem/puzzle, though I'm not sure if I've always just had some mod that makes that harder than vanilla. But the point is -- I've never, to this day, gotten very far in the technology tree in a true tribal/""ancient"" start. And I've never felt like I've been missing out or bored waiting for the technology to advance. It's exactly to the contrary.

The thing is, and this is the downside for me, the game is so gripping and slow in pace (which is an amazing thing) that every time I try to commit to a playthrough and actually get somewhere, something else in my life happens and I can't touch the game for months. Coming back after that, there's always either the fact that some mods no longer work either together or with the base game, or I've completely forgot the entire story I had been building and no longer felt any connection to the save even if it did work after all that time. So I've always just started again and again and again.

And never have I been able to get very far.

Which is absolutely okay, for me anyway. The most fulfilling part of the game in my opinion is the beginning. You get to know the characters, their quirks, you carefully fine-tune the work priorities, the daily schedules, select a spot for the colony and just start living it, slowly building atop each small achievement or milestone. It's a very intriguing combination of planning, building, honing and expanding on all of those iteratively, decision after decision.

And it's just a very gripping, fulfilling experience. More so than most games that I can think of.

This is a game that doesn't look like much, if you're used to triple-A level of graphics and UI. But the game itself is full of soul, full of possibilities and full of moments that'll make you feel something.

It's a game I would whole-heartedly suggest everyone sees for themselves. This might just be a game-changer for you too. Even if it isn't, I doubt you'll feel cheated of your time after you try it out. I'd even go as far as bet that you'll absolutely love it even if it doesn't stick."

RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Very enjoyable game. Lots of mod support that add additional features that add more variety to the base game. Completing the game is its own challenge, but there are a number of ways to play this that don't involve ""completing the game"" that add to the overall enjoyment. Very easy to become ""attached"" to your pawns like in X-com series. Keeping them alive while playing ""your"" way, is extremely challenging."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Probably one of the better town managment games in my library. Can be slow but with time and the will to survive you too can take over your rim world. Just get out there, oh and never trust Randy."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,yes
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,Organ selling is my favorite past-time. At least 50 hours.
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"To be honest it is a really good game for its price, even more so with the mods the awesome fanbase makes!"
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,its pretty fun
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,is great
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"when yes and then you yeah, you know? its really fun when you do that, especially with multiplayer mod."
RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"it's okay, keeps you busy for a bit"

Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Just play Civ 5. It is a much better game imo. Simple, fun, easy to get into but can be mastered with practice. This game has nothing going for it. The art style of the game is too cartoonish, the gameplay has a lot of content but little to no depth in most of the choices you make. The same base civ concepts are great because they are just the same thing from Civ 5. I find this game to be more tedious and more boring, I felt like there was too much unnecessary additions and goals added to the game. On top of that, just doing the bare minimum essentials to try and succeed in the standard game is a chore every few turns. I like being nervous every once and a while in Civ wether its barbarians or an actual war on my hands but I do not enjoy the amount of stress that you have to manage in this game. Like I said in the beginning of this review, If you have not played any Civ games and are considering this one to be your first, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS. BUY CIVILIZATION 5"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"The game itsself is good, but my god they absolutely ruined it with their awful awful launcher. I don't see why game devs like to shoot themselves in the foot just to have their special little launcher. It crashes constantly now, when before i could run giant oversized maps with no issues whatsoever. Please 2k give up on your launcher. Nobody likes it. Nobody wants it. It doesn't do anything to add to the experience. It just ruins it"
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Being forced to buy the DLC at full retail price, while other users can purchase it at 77% off is stupid. 

Even if i remove the product from my steam account it will block any attempt to re-purchase at the offer price. 

No way am i going to pay over £150 for DLC content when i can create a brand new account and buy a 77% off bundle for £41. 

Stupid and anti consumer."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"When compared to Civ V, this one is much better looking. Not just the graphics, but the menus as well, it's all more functional. Most of the changes are upgrades, to be honest."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Latest forced update caused major issues that I know have to uninstall and reinstall and I will lose all my saved files. Steam does nothing now but say they are just a place to buy and sell games offers no support and says I have to deal with 2K which I now have to create a 2K profile to get help with them. They are also no help saying its a known issue and have to just try to uninstall and reinstall and lose my stuff. So no help there and no longer purchasing through steam since they have become a pointless middle man.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,2k Launcher has made it impossible to open the game. Do not buy it.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Personally, I like CIV 6. Objectively speaking, it would be hard to recommend this game.

The CIV series was always one of my favorite strategy games. Building up your civilization from one tiny city to a world-spanning empire was and will always be fun.

Let's get the big negative out of the way. The 2K Launcher.
Which got inspired by the 4X genre. Explore, expand, exploit, exterminate.
2K explored new ways to annoy players. They expanded by introducing a new client. They exploit their player base by forcing this wreck on us. Finally, they exterminated any fun and positive reviews with it.

With that out of the way, let's get to a more detailed review.

CIV 6's aesthetics are a nice breath of fresh air and fit the game very well. Some people might prefer more realistic-looking graphics but I really like the new look.
The soundtrack is pretty solid as always, nothing to complain about there.
Sean Bean as the narrator did an amazing job, although the quotes are a bit weird sometimes. Definitely could have picked better ones for some techs, wonders and civics.

Now for the most important part, the gameplay.
CIV 6 is more casual than other titles. Every civ has its specific strengths that make them more suitable for certain builds. But you can play them pretty much however you want, at least in singleplayer. It is not a challenging or complex game and most difficulties will stem from RNG than anything else. You at least need the Rise & Fall and Gathering storm expansions, vanilla CIV 6 is way too barebone and offers little to no variety in gameplay.
Whenever I finish a singleplayer session with a civ, I always have to take a break, simply because it gets boring and repetitive after some time. You start to dominate the map way too soon and there is not a lot going on, even on higher difficulties. Emperor is probably the sweet spot for fun, Immortal and Deity can be very annoying sometimes."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I enjoyed this game while I could play it, but the new launcher broke it beyond playability and it crashes sometimes just sitting for a few minutes at the main menu. Wish Firaxis would fix the problems."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"My favorite game series since I was a kid on Civilization II but what did they do to this poor game? It seems like a recent update crashes the game and they never fixed the world builder (i.e. you can't use start locations). New features are steering away from realism. A history game with Zombies? That doesn't sit right with me. I would love to see more historical scenarios but firaxis isn't expanding on them anymore. 

From the start, Civilization VI felt outbalanced. District adjacencies will cause a player to massively outpace others. It isn't normal that I find myself with aircrafts and my buddies with swordsmen despite playing on different difficulty levels. The art is terrible with this mobile game feel to it but at least there are mods for that.

I'm waiting for a Civilization VII and I'm hoping they correct course and go back to what I loved about this game. Otherwise, I think I'll stick with their competitors like Paradox (Crusader Kings, Hearts of Iron) or Amplitude (Endless legends, Humankind)."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Do not recommend this game until the 2K launcher is removed and the game can launch through Steam again. I've managed to get the game to work 1/2 the time by launching directly from the Steam Files' .exe rather than using Steam, but that's just. Honestly absurd for a game that worked fine without a separate launcher. I shouldn't have to troubleshoot for 10-15 minutes to get a Steam game to run."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I got a notification that Civilization 6 will collect my data and ship it to other countries that may not have the same level of privacy collection.

I uninstalled the game right then and there, too bad I can't get a refund."
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Was the game great ? I may never know.  Is 2K  the Problem or just the hours that it will take to fix this Joke of a update. Until they fix it I would suggest A Thumbs Down Review. Remember Steam is stuck just like we are so leave a thumbs down at 2K and firaxis . They are the cause of this.
Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I've been playing this game from the very beginning. Its had some downs in the past with certain bugs/balance changes and sometimes the DLC model is a bit pricey, but all in all it was a fun experience. Until the most recent update completely broke the game. 

The final game update has been causing all sorts of problems for players across the board, from crashing and performance issues to broken maps and content: True Start Location (TSL) are busted for many players, some game mode combinations cause the game to crash during loading, map generation can get stuck in a infinite loop, and some people can't even get into the game at all.

On top of having Civ 6's final update falling flat on its face, 2K has decided to implement a brand new launcher. Feature complete with always on DRM for paying customers convenience, causing no end of stability and performance issues both in the launcher and in-game (if you can even get the game to load).

It hurts to ""not recommend"" Civ 6 after getting so much enjoyment out of it, but in its current state I can't. QA should have caught these bugs long before this update was pushed out, and 2K should seriously reconsider its launcher and DRM policies considering how negatively they effect their paying customers."

You are an outsider, an alien presence on this tarnished exo-solar planet not unlike our own, covered with water, trees and resources ripe for exploitation. You have one goal in mind: oppress the natives and expand your industrial empire at all costs.  

The same natives who will grow increasingly agitated at the blight's proliferation, and strike the sources of infection. This is where you will shoot them with guns, fire and nukes, reminding them of who is on top of the evolutionary chain. You will build even more elaborate contraptions to smash them more firmly, and satisfy your ego.

You will embrace the belt spaghetti.

Also the game never goes on sale so don't worry about getting blindsided by 50% off a week after you buy it, and has an excellent modding scene with built in mod browser."
Factorio,Strategy,427520,"TL;DR: RimWorld where you play as the only pawn who has to build, research, and defend a sprawling factory of your creation.

Crash-landed on a randomly generated alien world, you have to build up your own personal factory to manufacture resources from raw materials in order to ascend research tiers and ultimately construct a rocket for your escape. 

This is Factorio, a top-down game of placing conveyors, resource management, and base defense from the aliens that don't like pollution from all your coal-burning furnaces. You have to find a suitable starting point, start gathering basic stone and iron, and work your way up to an automated jungle of steel. The game has had several graphics updates since when I first picked it up, and the controls take a little getting used to, but the game play is extremely solid and satisfying. All of the pieces of automation just work and the logic for how conveyor belts, inserters, and assemblers do their jobs is satisfying when you learn how everything is supposed to go together.

Like many resource games, such as Minecraft, you are finding raw ore and smelting it into workable metal. You start with iron, copper, stone, and coal. Your early automation is fueled by coal, but one of the first things you do is set up electricity to power your inserters, assemblers, and research labs. As you develop more research, there unlocks more resources. Oil refining, uranium, steel plates, etc. Which in turn means more complexity to the middle and later games.

There are aliens that dislike pollution and will attack in waves once a threshold is complete. You'll have to break away from laying conveyor belting to defend your base, and can divert research and resources into construction of automated defenses too. Eventually you will even need to strike out on your own to clear out nests, as the aliens have valuable artifacts necessary for research of later technologies.

Most games nowadays don't have demos for you to try, they instead would rather you pay more for access to an incomplete mess. I have a feeling the developers really stand by their product, which is why it rarely goes on sale. Try Factorio out for free and see if you don't fall in love with it today. You'll get hundreds of hours of enjoyment for half the price of a ""full"" game that you'll be bored with in a fraction of the time."

Factorio,Strategy,427520,"Amazing game!

The current drama around this game is extra spicy. The left has decided to now threaten those even associated with supposed wrongthinkers with cancelling and are getting BTFO - look at the ratio of positive to negative reviews. YOU ARE LOSING the culture war. The only reason you think you are winning is the same powers spoonfeeding you all this hate are the ones that bring in the big guns of censorship to back you up - the CORPORATIONS. 

I can't wait until you lose for real. And you will. It is coming."

Factorio,Strategy,427520,"If you can make it past the great blue/purple science filter you can do anything.

You will lose hours of time ripping up your old buildings to rearrange them in a more efficient manner, only to do it again when you realized your design doesn't scale up as well.
You will embrace the belt spaghetti.

Also the game never goes on sale so don't worry about getting blindsided by 50% off a week after you buy it, and has an excellent modding scene with built in mod browser."
Factorio,Strategy,427520,"TL;DR: RimWorld where you play as the only pawn who has to build, research, and defend a sprawling factory of your creation.

Crash-landed on a randomly generated alien world, you have to build up your own personal factory to manufacture resources from raw materials in order to ascend research tiers and ultimately construct a rocket for your escape. 

This is Factorio, a top-down game of placing conveyors, resource management, and base defense from the aliens that don't like pollution from all your coal-burning furnaces. You have to find a suitable starting point, start gathering basic stone and iron, and work your way up to an automated jungle of steel. The game has had several graphics updates since when I first picked it up, and the controls take a little getting used to, but the game play is extremely solid and satisfying. All of the pieces of automation just work and the logic for how conveyor belts, inserters, and assemblers do their jobs is satisfying when you learn how everything is supposed to go together.

Like many resource games, such as Minecraft, you are finding raw ore and smelting it into workable metal. You start with iron, copper, stone, and coal. Your early automation is fueled by coal, but one of the first things you do is set up electricity to power your inserters, assemblers, and research labs. As you develop more research, there unlocks more resources. Oil refining, uranium, steel plates, etc. Which in turn means more complexity to the middle and later games.

There are aliens that dislike pollution and will attack in waves once a threshold is complete. You'll have to break away from laying conveyor belting to defend your base, and can divert research and resources into construction of automated defenses too. Eventually you will even need to strike out on your own to clear out nests, as the aliens have valuable artifacts necessary for research of later technologies.

Most games nowadays don't have demos for you to try, they instead would rather you pay more for access to an incomplete mess. I have a feeling the developers really stand by their product, which is why it rarely goes on sale. Try Factorio out for free and see if you don't fall in love with it today. You'll get hundreds of hours of enjoyment for half the price of a ""full"" game that you'll be bored with in a fraction of the time."
Factorio,Strategy,427520,Thank you whiny R*dditors for reminding me to give this great game the positive review it deserves.

STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack,Strategy,32470,"Amazing game. The graphics are potato but the immersive gameplay makes up for it. I suggest to also install either or both Thrawns Revenge and Fall of the Republic Mods. These are possibly some of the best addons for the game. Any Star Wars fan or non Star Wars who who enjoys strategy games would really enjoy this early 2000's masterpiece. Enjoy being the next Grand Moff Tarkin, Darth Vader, Mon Mothma or Admiral Ackbar. This is not a trap. B)"
STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack,Strategy,32470,"This game is and probably always will be my favorite Star Wars game. I remember seeing a YouTube let's play series of this game with the Republic at War mod almost a decade ago when I was 9 years old, and I knew I had to get it. I ordered a copy that may have been a tad bit overpriced off ebay and played it for countless hours that aren't on steam (Except I couldn't figure out how to make mods work back then so I didn't end up playing republic at war until years later). A few years later I got a massive Star Wars bundle on Steam for sale, and this was in it. I proceeded to put hundreds of more hours into this game. 

There isn't much else to say that hasn't been said in the other reviews. It's incredibly satisfying to take over the galaxy, building up your army to colossal proportions. The space combat in particular is intense, fun, and strategic. The same cannot be said about the ground combat, however. Most of the time I end up auto-resolving land battles, which sucks because I feel like the ground vehicles and weapons in Star Wars deserve a lot more love than they get. Also, the management of your empire should be more involved. You can't start trade routes, you can't make laws or policies, and there are no systems in place that take into consideration the population of your empire. No public unrest, or amenities, or even unhappiness. All of the buildings you build go towards either the economy or warfare. It would be so cool to build arenas like the one in Attack of the Clones, or government buildings on Coruscant. Just anything really. I would go so far as to say that the galaxy overview is just barely a step above the main menu, mainly being a vessel to bring you to battles. However, it's important to remember that the game is 15 years old now, and many of the features I just talked about weren't as common or developed in the genre. I just really wish there was a little more focus on the ""Empire"" aspect in ""Empire at War"". 

After all that negative, it may seem like I don't really like the game, but that's not true at all. The ability to use heroes is really cool, and it's fun using characters you wouldn't expect, like old man obi-wan, or yoda. Some heroes can also smuggle credits or steal technologies, which adds a little more depth to them. Along with the unexpected nature of some heroes, there are some weird vehicles and planets in this game, a lot of them being their only appearance outside of books and comics. Also, the modding community is top-notch. The work that some of these people do is phenomenal, and it really turns this game into something truly special. The quantity of mods is nowhere near Minecraft or Skyrim levels, but the quality is unreal. 

Overall, I'd give the vanilla game a low 7/10 maybe even a 6.5. I have a lot of nostalgia for it, but there are definitely a lot of flaws. With mods, however, I'd give it an 8.5 or a 9. Even though it's my favorite Star Wars game, I don't think it's the best. The space combat is amazing, and the modding community is awesome, but the issues I have with the game would require a full on remake or sequel (sidenote: this should definitely happen) to be fixed. I would really only recommend this game to Star Wars fans (which granted is a massive group of people), but if you're just a strategy fan, I'd say avoid it unless it's on a deep sale."

STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack,Strategy,32470,"Amazing game. The graphics are potato but the immersive gameplay makes up for it. I suggest to also install either or both Thrawns Revenge and Fall of the Republic Mods. These are possibly some of the best addons for the game. Any Star Wars fan or non Star Wars who who enjoys strategy games would really enjoy this early 2000's masterpiece. Enjoy being the next Grand Moff Tarkin, Darth Vader, Mon Mothma or Admiral Ackbar. This is not a trap. B)"
STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack,Strategy,32470,"This game is and probably always will be my favorite Star Wars game. I remember seeing a YouTube let's play series of this game with the Republic at War mod almost a decade ago when I was 9 years old, and I knew I had to get it. I ordered a copy that may have been a tad bit overpriced off ebay and played it for countless hours that aren't on steam (Except I couldn't figure out how to make mods work back then so I didn't end up playing republic at war until years later). A few years later I got a massive Star Wars bundle on Steam for sale, and this was in it. I proceeded to put hundreds of more hours into this game. 

There isn't much else to say that hasn't been said in the other reviews. It's incredibly satisfying to take over the galaxy, building up your army to colossal proportions. The space combat in particular is intense, fun, and strategic. The same cannot be said about the ground combat, however. Most of the time I end up auto-resolving land battles, which sucks because I feel like the ground vehicles and weapons in Star Wars deserve a lot more love than they get. Also, the management of your empire should be more involved. You can't start trade routes, you can't make laws or policies, and there are no systems in place that take into consideration the population of your empire. No public unrest, or amenities, or even unhappiness. All of the buildings you build go towards either the economy or warfare. It would be so cool to build arenas like the one in Attack of the Clones, or government buildings on Coruscant. Just anything really. I would go so far as to say that the galaxy overview is just barely a step above the main menu, mainly being a vessel to bring you to battles. However, it's important to remember that the game is 15 years old now, and many of the features I just talked about weren't as common or developed in the genre. I just really wish there was a little more focus on the ""Empire"" aspect in ""Empire at War"". 

After all that negative, it may seem like I don't really like the game, but that's not true at all. The ability to use heroes is really cool, and it's fun using characters you wouldn't expect, like old man obi-wan, or yoda. Some heroes can also smuggle credits or steal technologies, which adds a little more depth to them. Along with the unexpected nature of some heroes, there are some weird vehicles and planets in this game, a lot of them being their only appearance outside of books and comics. Also, the modding community is top-notch. The work that some of these people do is phenomenal, and it really turns this game into something truly special. The quantity of mods is nowhere near Minecraft or Skyrim levels, but the quality is unreal. 

Overall, I'd give the vanilla game a low 7/10 maybe even a 6.5. I have a lot of nostalgia for it, but there are definitely a lot of flaws. With mods, however, I'd give it an 8.5 or a 9.

Total War: MEDIEVAL II – Definitive Edition,Strategy,4700,Still a fantastic game in 2021
Total War: MEDIEVAL II – Definitive Edition,Strategy,4700,"In a realm of rivalries, intrigue and plots, what does one damsel matter? When lords are being routinely slaughtered on the battlefield, with the prisoner of wars heads being scalped and flung over catapults into the city square, why does one nubile 18 year old harridan bear any degree of significance? Is it not instead the men bearing steel that matter in these turbulent times? IS IT NOT THEM WHO WATCH THEIR BROTHERS GORGED ATOP A PIKE, OR ENVISION THEIR LIMBS BEING HACKED OFF BY ISLAMIC HERETICS? I yet again present a moral quandary, is it fair that I am to be skewered by an Englishmen, a rambunctious Saesneg, for the sole crime of pollinating his daughter and wife? I tell you, even as I sit atop the bloodstained ground, I do not regret ploughing his daughter and wife, for it was as though I was striding across a wheatfield, oh how the wind parted the hem of her dress, permitting myself convenient and swift entry. I copulated with these two stunning damsels, bearing a smile atop my face, simultaneously before and after the wounds were inflicted across my chest. For who could not be exuberant in these auspicious times? This upstart nobleman, this utter depraved fiend, observed his virgin daughter become deflowered, with his wife being thoroughly titillated by my deftly skillful abilities as a master consummator. It must have angered that surly upstart, filled him with the smoldering rage of Duna, imbued him with such immense fury, that would then be channeled into the arbitrary, albeit powerful swings of his sword. 

Despite, entering his estate armed, anticipating conflict, I was ultimately taken at surprise. I had to hastily fasten my breeches, don my sword and fend back the beasts rapid oncoming blows. However, despite my initial attempts in the duel yielding fruition, I realized that my fate was inevitable. This man, although bearing English descent, which of course insinuates an inherent lack of expertise, was a mad, mouth frothing beast, one who would naught cease his efforts until I lay upon the ground, with a fatal wound at my side. As such, albeit acknowledging my fate and the futility of this duel, I obstinately held on until the very end. Until my capitulation, I contemplated about many a venture, I gave prayer and reverence to Protestant Jesus, recited Gandalf’s philosophy regarding the afterlife, realized that Mike Tyson is a homeless man, who has donned an exoskeleton suit to triumph in the MMA and lastly, I fondly recalled the sweet delectable taste, of this Englishman’s wife. It was that last thought, which remained prominent in my mind as the lethal blow was inflicted across my chest. I recall falling to the ground, being transported onto a wide green field, outside the castle expanse where my brothers loitered, all the while simultaneously bearing a jubilant grin atop my face. It was then that I serenaded to them the story of my exploits and my subsequent defeat, at the hands of a feisty Englishman. 

A ballad, nay the elaborate tale, upon the slaughter of my gallant and promiscuous Welsh monarch at the hands of a furious, cuckholded Saesneg, whose nubile harlot of a wife was seduced.

The Englishman's wife was as fair as the sun,
and her kisses were warmer than spring.
But the Englishman's blade was made of black steel,
and its kiss was a terrible thing.
The Englishman's wife would sing as she bathed,
in a voice that was sweet as a peach,
But the Englishman's blade had a song of its own,
and a bite sharp and cold as a leech.
As I lay on the ground with the darkness around,
and the taste of his blood on my tongue,
My brothers knelt by me and prayed a sombre prayer,
Albeit I smiled and laughed and sung,
""Brothers, oh brothers, my days here are done,
the Englishman's taken my life,
But what does it matter, for all men must die,
and I've tasted the Englishman's wife!"""

*My time played isn’t accurate, I had a physical version of this game in the past and have put more towards 80-100hrs into it and the DLCs. Though this review is very much focused on the base game.

The intro – Yes, the opening cinematic deserves a mention. As with pretty much all GamesWorkshop offerings cinematics are not afterthoughts, and I think DoW was the first one. I love this opening, it still looks good, it gets you pumped to play the game, good bit of action right before you get to take charge yourself.

The Graphics – Writing this review in 2021, lets immediately remember this game came out in 2004. A LOT has changed in graphics since then. Are they dated, yes, does that destroy the enjoyment, not really. When playing this shows in some of the scenery the units still look quite good when you’re zoomed out, the in mission cutscenes however do show how old the graphics are though.

The Story – I liked the story, it was done well and made you feel like you were building towards something uncovering a big secret, even if the missions were at that core the same rinse n repeat. 😊

The gameplay – 
- Build a small firebase, capture control points, hold em, take the enemies points, blow up their base. Simples.
- There was a bit of rock paper scissors going on with units, and it could nicely be tipped in your favour with Unit upgrades.
- The maps are often commented to be a little small certainly in Skirmish, but that wasn’t always the worst thing as your unit count wasn’t huge, powerful units were your goals in this rather than a zerg rush.
- There was purpose to using the map to your advantage, shell holes provided cover, though things like elevation aren’t a thing.

Value for money?
Current retail price is £9.99… That is too much for such an old game. Now based on my Beer to Time ratio, I think if you’d get your money’s worth if you played the campaign, you’d need to get about 3 hours out of it I think that’s easily doable. But a tenner for such an old game feels wrong.

Chuck this in your wishlist if you are a 40k fan, it’ll show up in a seasonal sale soon enough."

*My time played isn’t accurate, I had a physical version of this game in the past and have put more towards 80-100hrs into it and the DLCs. Though this review is very much focused on the base game.

The intro – Yes, the opening cinematic deserves a mention. As with pretty much all GamesWorkshop offerings cinematics are not afterthoughts, and I think DoW was the first one. I love this opening, it still looks good, it gets you pumped to play the game, good bit of action right before you get to take charge yourself.

The Graphics – Writing this review in 2021, lets immediately remember this game came out in 2004. A LOT has changed in graphics since then. Are they dated, yes, does that destroy the enjoyment, not really. When playing this shows in some of the scenery the units still look quite good when you’re zoomed out, the in mission cutscenes however do show how old the graphics are though.

The Story – I liked the story, it was done well and made you feel like you were building towards something uncovering a big secret, even if the missions were at that core the same rinse n repeat. 😊

The gameplay – 
- Build a small firebase, capture control points, hold em, take the enemies points, blow up their base. Simples.
- There was a bit of rock paper scissors going on with units, and it could nicely be tipped in your favour with Unit upgrades.
- The maps are often commented to be a little small certainly in Skirmish, but that wasn’t always the worst thing as your unit count wasn’t huge, powerful units were your goals in this rather than a zerg rush.
- There was purpose to using the map to your advantage, shell holes provided cover, though things like elevation aren’t a thing.

Value for money?
Current retail price is £9.99… That is too much for such an old game. Now based on my Beer to Time ratio, I think if you’d get your money’s worth if you played the campaign, you’d need to get about 3 hours out of it I think that’s easily doable. But a tenner for such an old game feels wrong.

Chuck this in your wishlist if you are a 40k fan, it’ll show up in a seasonal sale soon enough."

ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,Overall the game is a fairly stable one.  It does provide some good hours of play time.  But my main problem is the creators of the game believe that their game is worth over $100.  There is NO WAY there is enough in here to justify that price.  I think they need to come back down and revisit reality.  If a gaming house finds themselves creating more content in DLC than in the actual game then they made the game wrong from the very beginning.
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"This is a fantastic and highly addictive game. 
When is Endless Space 3 coming out?"
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"Solid 4X with fun lore, neat combat, clean visuals."
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"While Endless Space 2 attempts grandeur in battles between space empires, there is quite a bit to be desired. While the game promotes the ability to win in a variety of ways, there really isn't that many options. More than likely, you'll be forced into a technology or economy victory, as the AI will hardly ever allow an influence victory and galactic conquest is almost entirely out of the question due to dated mechanics. There is beautiful planets, and you do feel a sense of discovery while sending probes to investigate anomalies. There is even some custom dialogue that makes opponents feel a bit more real. However, the majority of time playing is attempting to understand a complex 4X strategy to only be underwhelmed at how small the game feels once understood. Like real space, Endless Space 2 feels mostly empty."
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"While combat itself is a bit simplistic (ship design is still complex), this game is absolutely beautiful to look at and has hands down the best UI I have ever seen. Would totally recommend!"
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"Endless Space? More like Endless Bugs.

ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,Good Scifi game. With the ESG mod this is a perfect game.
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"It's a good game, definitely worth the money. The battles are very well made, both fun to watch and with just enough tactics involved. Overall the experience is polished. On the negative side is that the AI struggles to play the game, as with many of these types of games. I've played two campaigns, one on normal and one on serious, and the enemies have not once sieged one of my planets, and I'm no expert player. Would be very interested in what the developer has in store for their next game! A big step forward would be an AI that can keep up."
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,Love that it kept my attention for 379 hours and counting.... Just one more turn... Like any other 4X game.
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,Endless Space Two is a beautiful game that have a very interesting premise and changing game play depending on the faction chosen. The Academy faction added in the last DLC should only be able to take the stars next to the academy and no more as to not be a nuisance.
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,392110,"Shit's buggy. half the time I put a ship in the construction queue it just waits the set amount of turns and tells me it's complete, then when I go to look for it it's just gone."

Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,Strategy,779340,"Total War: Three Kingdoms is set in the titular period that most of us probably know from Dynasty Warriors.

The Good:
+Probably the most aesthetic game of the franchise. Everything from menus to cinematics.
+Interesting new setting is well-presented and sticks to the formular.
+Diplomacy has never been better, hopefully this system will be carried onward to all new titles.
+The romance option and legendary duels do feel pretty natural on the battlefield.

The Bad:
-Feels like a heavy case of style over substance. The menues have never been worse.
-This in turn carries over to battles, where so much information has been curbed for a 'cleaner' look.
-Despite unique faction features, the clans all feel so very similar.
-The new recruitment and supply systems slows the early game down immensely.

Bottom Line:
TW: Three Kingdoms is not bad, but it is a mediocre entrance in a series with great games. If you are really into the setting, get it on sale."

Basically, the publisher made a client, it forces you to launch the game through their client, and said client CRASHES when you have a heavily modded setup like I used to. 244 hours invested into the game, and 2k decided to remove my ability to enjoy their product based on greed. Their client has LESS functionality than community-coded solutions (like the AML XCom launcher) and made the game unplayable for me.

2021. This game is 5 years old. I used to play it on a daily basis. And now I can't because some dumb-ass greedy executive decided it would be neat to force another middleman launcher buggy as all hell.
