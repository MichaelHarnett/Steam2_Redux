0,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Action,730,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",730

As far as playing games go I have always liked playing competitive fps' as I find they are fun to learn and it is satisfying to do well as much as it is fun to win in ranked. The skill threshold for this game is sufficiently high while you can still play it casually and enjoy it if you don't mind getting destroyed by the occasional smurf every now and then. if you want to improve however this is the easiest way to do so.

-Learn recoils for different weapons.(workshop maps are amazing for this)
-Learn nades( pop flashes, smoke and molly lineups etc)
-Up to preference but as I'm still learning all the maps I stick to one or two maps when I play before switching  to another once I'm confident on that map and can remember smokes and where to play.
-Watch pro league watching better people play can help you learn how to play.
-Youtube videos on how to play are good but I mainly just recommend watching them for nade lineups and good positions to play.
-As good as trying to play like a pro like stewie2k sounds just make sure to remember what works for pros might not necessarily work for you as you probably don't have the game knowledge or aim that they have i.e. as cool as being like the smoke criminal may sound rushing through t smoke when you're ct probably isn't the greatest idea.(unless you have REALLY good aim in which case who knows it might work out for you.)

2,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"First up this is just my second account on Steam on my Main Account I’m Level 172 Plat 2 with almost 900 hours on pc and played since release on Xbox till Plat 1 almost Diamond.

Feel free to share this review with your friends and or buddy’s to finally get Ubisoft to understand that Rainbow Six Siege is just a shit show that needs to be reworked and rethought to stay relevant. 

Rainbow Six Siege is a game that I loved playing almost religiously every single day with my friends. Nowadays I see myself tired of this game, almost playing next to none. Playing games like Halo, Half Life, CSGO, Homeworld Remastered, Hearts of Iron 4, Day of Defeat: Source, Left 4 Dead, Battlefield 4 and 1 again and having the fun of my life inside those games. That’s a moment I thought to myself: How come I have this fun again? This mysterious feeling of, I fucked up but I’m still laughing about it. This was the time it “clicked” inside my head; you see. All the games listed above encourage you to play casually, and to have fun. The games don’t take themselves seriously. Yeah yeah, CSGO has a massive Pro League behind it but, we still play it casually or? Like your friend saying: Yo man if you one click this AWP in mid with a Deagle I’ll spent ya a beer. And you of course you go ahead and do it. Even if you die, you all can laugh about it. Or you can just mess around in TDM, Conquest (Battlefield), Co-Op and I don’t know what else. 

Rainbow Six Siege doesn’t encourage Casual Play, which it needs. It even punishes you for it.

That is sad but also true, think about “Quickmatch”, remember when it was called “Casual”? Yeah, we all miss those times, right? You can’t play Siege for fun or casually, as the game doesn’t allow it. Siege would need to make the In-Game Events playable for any given time, like Sugar Fright, Doctors Curse (And yes I know you can host Event game modes in the near future, but you would still need 9 other players for it and invite them), also Rainbow Six Siege could also add Team Death Match, where players just play for points, respawning, and killing the OPFOR (Opposing Force for all of you who don’t know what OPFOR stands for), of course they would need to make maps for this specific game mode, but wouldn’t that be better then to search for an Quickmatch where you die the moment you spawn because of spawnpeeks, or an operator that your team didn’t call out because there is no real communication going on and then wait 3 whole minutes to play again because this one teammate decides to stay on the roof on Bank to “save his K/D”. Quickmatch is also infuriating for many players as they play most of the time solo or with a buddy and then have to sweat for nothing just because the 9th million Jaeger or Ash main destroys you and treats it as ranked and even shit talks you in the chat. It becomes tiresome and frustrating. But hey atleast the Devs put much effort into making events and event maps that we can only play for a limited time, instead of adding fresh new game modes to a game that would really need it.  

Now as we are on the “adding” things. The game is stale. There is no need to lie as even a hardcore fan must admit that it is really boring as of right now. Flores didn’t add much to the game and is almost forgotten, as a Maverick or Zofia/Ash does the job much better than him (In my opinion, which can differ greatly to everyone to any region) because they aren’t handicaped because of Mute and or Mozzi which you see often in the game. With the new Season North Star or however it is called the new healing Operator Thunderbird is also underwhelming, as people tend to use Doc because of the MP 5. Giving her the ability for the Spear .308 won’t change to much about it, even if it is an Assault Rifle that she gets doesn’t mean that she will be strong…. And even will be nerfed before she even comes out like they did with Flores. The same applies to the Jager nerf. Who in their right mind though it’s a good idea to nerf his gun? If you think about it, the Devs wanted to make roaming with him harder as he can’t be as strong in firefights anymore as before. But its his ability that makes him great and the gun as people love playing with. It looks cool, works smooth and is satisfying. And removing 5 bullets and an increase of vertical recoil won’t affect him to much, as he is still a viable Operator with a satisfying gun and the best gadget in the whole game. 

We must wait now for almost a year for the Nokk buff and Melusi nerf. Nokk is not picked often and would be greatly improved with it, while Melusi is not only overpicked but is also a really strong operator and great intel giver (As her Banshees have these wobble sound effects when you come near them), but oh yeah right Melusi got “nerfed” by removing the T-5 and replacing it with the MP5… Fuck sake Ubisoft whatever you smoked, stop it or at least give me some of it too. 

Ban phases OH BOY, OH MAN. How about you guys just fucking delete this system and just implement one like CSGO has? Where can you choose the Maps, you want to play on? Instead of having 3 different random maps chosen for you where you “ban” with the opposing team, but you still end up banning Bank together and now it chooses between Theme Park and Oregon? Great thing right. I mean Yeah, this whole Map ban system is complete worthless as it still is random which map you play on. In theory it works, but practically it doesn’t. I guess I can give the “At least you tried” award to you guys for this one feature. 

Toxicity is something you guys are working actively against, but still, it shows no real impact. Even with your new system that will come with the Trust Factor won’t be doing too much against it. Look at Overwatch, the whole community there is toxic as hell (and yes, I played Overwatch back in 2016 as some friends forced me to it) this is something that every heavy competitive game must go through, as players become actively frustrated because of their teammates and the enemy, being hardstuck Gold I for the entire season and don’t even rank up as they clearly show a higher skill level, unlike their team. And still play against Diamond players. But eh, guess this is how things are now. 

Ubisoft, you must do much more to the game then you imagine. The way you handle it as a “very serious tactical Competitive shooter” doesn’t work, don’t forget the casual players. And no don’t tell me: you didn’t forget about them, and that you try everything possible to make everyone happy, as this is not the case. Don’t listen to much what Plat 1 – Champion players say and what the Pro league says. It’s the same with Zofias withstand mechanic, for all the years it worked perfectly fine, after this one match in Pro League it got removed as it “Didn’t fit into Rainbow Six Siege and not because of this Stream” I call bullshit, as it was a great mechanic, and I never felt that it is unfair, as only Zofia could do it with only 5 HP, and most of the time you still died but it defined her character. 

In my opinion, you guys miss the mark in what Rainbow Six Siege wants to be, you treat it as a very serious tactical shooter. But the more serious it gets; the more frustrated players will be. They stop playing the game because they burn out and can’t have fun in it and eventually leave. New Players can’t get a foot in the door, as they either get demolished by smurfs or good players and maybe play the game 5 hours and eventually leave when they meet with a very sweaty and toxic community. The game is stale for long term players as you don’t make new maps we can play on and create new tactics (if you can call them tactics anymore), no real interesting operator. No new weapons that spice things up again.

2,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"I've been playing this game since release, and while I don't hate the game for what it is today, it has just lost the spark of that incredibly tactical and realistic feel. I'm not one to go ""new=bad"", and there were sci-fi elements on release (like Jager's anti-grenades, though they were all believable back then), but what I enjoyed about the game is gone at this point. You won't find the tactical shooter where every death massively changes the game and teamwork is essential to every step in a realistic feel, but a load of a million different traps you have to get around, memorizing what 50+ characters do to even be able to fight them, characters that their abilities feel like they're meant for a game (not an actual raid scenario), and devs pushing out power-creep characters, making the classics rarely used. (like seriously what did they do to thatcher?) It took them 6 years to make the most useless operator (Tachanka) into something good. Did they do this with other useless operators? Castle? Nope. Blitz? Buffed then destroyed by nerf. Alibi? Nope! Doc? Only useful in casual. Finka? Monty? Glaz? Lion? Doki doki? Warden? ANYONE?
No. But the new operator is going to be overpowered! Then nerfed 2 months in... (This has always been a problem)

The game isn't bad, but it's not what it was. Feels like 1 step forwards, 2 steps back with it. If you're unsure on whether to get the game, watch some streams (both old and new), and see if you like the new style it's gone to, but personally, I do not.

2,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"With the hours i have (111) on PC and around 500 on console because my friends are on those platforms I can't recommend this game in the state its in even in the future and i'll list my reasons. The game is far from what it was 2017 - 2019 to now what made siege great was that it was a tactical military shooter fighting terrorists and all that, now we have operators that are completely sci fi it also has gotten really confusing with all these operators left right and centre its hard to keep track, another thing that stings is the removal of maps or reworking of maps without keeping the original and just removing it from existence. the ranked scene and even casual is even horrible with horrible teammates being completely toxic and never wanting to help anyone even new players team killing just because of a mistake don't get me wrong its funny as all fuck in casual or when you're just messing around but when you want to chill and play or even concentrate to play ranked it gets frustrating and makes you want to quit, you'll meet good people trust me I've met friends and still talk to them to this day. I'm going to mention another problem specifically the console which isn't a problem here  i ask ubisoft to at least contact microsoft and playstation of the MNK problem for consoles its gotten so horrendous that i can't even play casual anymore to just chill with my mates no word or anything has been said about the issue just "" Oh we don't condone it please don't do it"" But what does that achieve? Nothing and it'll only get worse making console player base get smaller and smaller of the people who just don't want to cheat or they'll cave and spend horrendous amount of money on a xim just to get good when the thing doesn't even mimic mouse movement correctly. 

I'll close out this review from a person who loved siege and played it religiously and got platnium twice i loved it for the fact it offered challenge where i was used to games like cod and overwatch where almost every move counted or you had to at least think of what you were doing instead of just roaming around shooting like a idiot this game told you  you "" this isn't cod don't treat it like it"" And let me tell you when i first started out it was hard i died almost every round but i was still having fun i loved this games community with tachanka jokes and annual events that i got excited for I've made amazing memories with this game with 1V5 and aces i don't write this review as a hater i write it as a person who loved siege and watched every singe trailer for new season i wish to see change though i doubt with how ubisoft treats its employees and the way they package their games as some lazy open world i doubt we'll see anything of that nature so for right now siege will be this hero sci fi shooter which has lost its identity.",359550

2,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Action,359550,"With the hours i have (111) on PC and around 500 on console because my friends are on those platforms I can't recommend this game in the state its in even in the future and i'll list my reasons. The game is far from what it was 2017 - 2019 to now what made siege great was that it was a tactical military shooter fighting terrorists and all that, now we have operators that are completely sci fi it also has gotten really confusing with all these operators left right and centre its hard to keep track, another thing that stings is the removal of maps or reworking of maps without keeping the original and just removing it from existence. the ranked scene and even casual is even horrible with horrible teammates being completely toxic and never wanting to help anyone even new players team killing just because of a mistake don't get me wrong its funny as all fuck in casual or when you're just messing around but when you want to chill and play or even concentrate to play ranked it gets frustrating and makes you want to quit, you'll meet good people trust me I've met friends and still talk to them to this day. I'm going to mention another problem specifically the console which isn't a problem here  i ask ubisoft to at least contact microsoft and playstation of the MNK problem for consoles its gotten so horrendous that i can't even play casual anymore to just chill with my mates no word or anything has been said about the issue just "" Oh we don't condone it please don't do it"" But what does that achieve? Nothing and it'll only get worse making console player base get smaller and smaller of the people who just don't want to cheat or they'll cave and spend horrendous amount of money on a xim just to get good when the thing doesn't even mimic mouse movement correctly. 

I'll close out this review from a person who loved siege and played it religiously and got platnium twice i loved it for the fact it offered challenge where i was used to games like cod and overwatch where almost every move counted or you had to at least think of what you were doing instead of just roaming around shooting like a idiot this game told you  you "" this isn't cod don't treat it like it"" And let me tell you when i first started out it was hard i died almost every round but i was still having fun i loved this games community with tachanka jokes and annual events that i got excited for I've made amazing memories with this game with 1V5 and aces i don't write this review as a hater i write it as a person who loved siege and watched every singe trailer for new season i wish to see change though i doubt with how ubisoft treats its employees and the way they package their games as some lazy open world i doubt we'll see anything of that nature so for right now siege will be this hero sci fi shooter which has lost its identity.",359550

I've played some missions over and over again with different people, alone or some friends ( since i don't have many) and each experience was far away different from the first one just because those whom u play with are different. i got it yesterday and i was like okay lemme just see what I've got. ended up playing 10 hours straight..",49520

6,Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"This game has been one that I have dreaded playing for a long time... While I had heard that the game was amazing and a true masterpiece of the FPS RPG Genre I must admit that the artstyle was something that left a sour taste in my mouth as the visuals were particularly not my favourite. However I lost a bet with a friend years ago and he told me that as compensation I had to buy this game and one day do a runthrough with him to truly see what a masterpiece this game was, so I purchased it but still hadn't played it for some time. Then my roommate saw that I owned it and asked if he could use my Steam to play it on my PC every so often, even bought all the DLC shortly afterwards (minus the Commander Lilith DLC that leads into Borderlands 3 which i still have yet to obtain) just so he could play it not far from me while I was chilling on my Playstation or Xbox... And the jokes about this game, all over my facebook and all over my youtube for years even to the point that friends of mine made references to this game in D&D games that I was the Dungeon Master for... It seemed I could not escape my fate from this game, and so finally... as of about 8 days ago... I bit the bullet, got three of my mates, one who hadn't played before either and two that had, and we finally did a runthrough...

Now of my 104 hours that the review says I will admit that about 60 of them are actually mine, and the artstyle still annoys the hell out of me to this day BUT the rest of the game? Well it more than makes up for the artstyle's aggravation as this game is fun, hilarious and just left me with too many moments of joy, laughter and WTF episodes and my only regret is that in all honesty I should have played this sooner... I should have been shooting skag's in the mouth just as I left Highschool, I should have been beating down Psycho Midgets well before I moved towns and I sure as hell should have been cracking Handsome Jack's smug skull in WELL BEFORE I started university... But alas my stubbornness and that deplorable artstyle truly got in the way of this otherwise gem in the rough.

So thank you friend of mine for making that bet with me and forcing me to give it an honest go, for the hilarious moments were truly great, thank you players of my games for making references from well written lines and characters from this fantastic game, thank you best friends for joining me on this great crusade through Pandora and helping me to see the fun, thank you 2K for getting this game to all the boys and girls who really wanna smash Psycho's in the wasteland and thank you Gearbox and their staff members for taking the time to make this game as amazing and enjoyable as it is (minus the artists, i'm sorry but I cannot give you any praise as I can never personally forgive the style personally).

Now if you'll excuse me... I'm probably going to sink another 100 hours into this game at the very least and even play all the other sequels, prequels and predecessors with my friends to make up for lost time.

6,Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"Waiting for steam summer sale to buy that last DLC for this game, so I decided to take a break from borderland 2 to play LRFF and a few other games. While waiting I decided to finish my review for this game first.

Some of the best games in my library I didn’t play yet because I am still missing DLC like Dishonored or Stellaris as I always want to try to get the full experience of a game before I move onto other backlogs in my libraries. Borderlands 2 has been burning a hole on my playlist for a long time because of missing DLCs. A lot friend told me to play with them for many years but without getting the DLC it just feels weird for me. 

Being released for a long time this game is still in very good Quality. Great map design, Story, funny dialogue with awesome voice acting and the little madness in everybody. The interface and gameplay itself are still high standard in today’s game world. Difficulty is a bit higher then needed as game is expected to be play with a bunch of friends. I recommend explore each map and do missions that’s at least 2 level below yours and keep it that way so you don’t have to die too much. 

Lucky for us there is skeleton chest that you can open with golden key you can find by searching internet. Upgrade your guns using that every 4-5 levels or so using it so you don’t have to depend on quest reward and loot drops. Currently there are about 230 keys still available to grab before they expire and they do release more from time to time.

I was unlucky enough that play through the entire game + 3 major DLC not a single legendary dropped for me but normal people does have better luck than I do. Ouch, I am going to go cry in a corner now and let’s finish this review quickly.

9.5/10 would be my final score for this game as a whole and once I have the last DLC I will play through the game again in new game+ and the other 3 major DLC that I haven’t touched yet. Recommend for anyone and everyone, if you haven’t play this get all expansion on a sale and play now, you need to know the entire Borderlands story as the whole series is going very strong and new games and new expansions are being made constantly. Adding Borderland 3 + all DLCs into my Wishlist right now.

The looter shooter that got me into the Borderlands universe. Among the witty one-liners, unique humor, intriguing story, and deep characters is some rather addictive gameplay. You can shoot bad guys. You can shoot your friends. You can shoot a gun that shoots guns that shoot your friends. Or bad guys. Sometimes the bad guys shoot each other. Sometimes the good guys shoot each other. The most handsome guy in the game is a bad guy. The most annoying character in the game is a good guy. There's a gun that screams. Like, vocal screaming. There are dudes that just scream in general. You can have all this just cause you feel like it.

Arguably the best entry to the Borderlands universe.

☐ Masterpiece

☐ Poor
☐ None

In this age of kind of crappy storytelling, Gearbox can still deliver games with very engaging stories without sacrificing gameplay quality. That seems to be a rare commodity nowadays. You'll meet some recurring characters from the original Borderlands as well as brand new characters. To me, there isn't a single character where I'd rather not see them in the game. Each character is very well written, and they blend together to form one of the most interesting stories in modern entertainment. The only reason the story doesn't earn a Masterpiece rating from me is because it is a bit cliche. Good guys defeat bad guy and save the world. The path that the good guys take to defeat the bad guy is what's very engaging.

===[ ☼ Visuals/Graphics: ]===
☐ Masterpiece
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ Visual catastrophe
☐ Ask M. Night Shyamalan to make a movie of it

For a 2012 game, it still looks fantastic. Some of the animations definitely look outdated, but most of the time, you're paying attention to the plot more than anything so there's a good chance you'll miss the weird-ish animations.

===[ ♬ Sounds/Music: ]===
☐ Masterpiece (Beethoven is smiling in his grave)
☑ Memorable
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ Do not put your ears through this terror

The music is pretty good. There are little jingles and tunes here and there that you'll likely remember for a long time. The overall sound design is great quality, but doesn't exactly stand out against other games like NieR:Automata.

===[ ☣ Hardware Requirements: ]===
☐ A stone tablet should be able to run it
☐ Minimum
☑ Average
☐ High End
☐ Quantum Computing may not be enough

For some reason, my RTX 2080 Super is ""running out of video memory"" once or twice per session. That definitely has me raising an eyebrow, but the game runs flawlessly otherwise.

===[ § Bugs: ]===
☐ None to report
☑ Some, but still completely playable
☐ Several annoying bugs
☐ Unplayable

Generally the game runs as you would expect, but you'll also run into moments where you're like ""wtf just happened?"". If anything, these ""wtf"" moments add comedic value to the game which already has loads of comedic value.

6,Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"[h1]Best FPS game I've ever played![/h1]

The story is fun & enjoyable. Love the characters & personalities, the jokes, and stunning scenery of post-apocalyptic & steampunk combined. There are a lot of interesting quests like: you massacre every enemies or find treasures. The main characters are just awesome! They have different skills (don't forget the costumes!) so you can choose whatever character's skill do you like. I really like the weapons design, it's like every weapon is one of a kind.

Although the game was good, it has flaws. I [b]REALLY HATE[/b] the timed quest. I want to enjoy the game not speedrunning it. And the reward.. well.. not worth it.. I can't play co-op too, maybe because of the internet connection...

This game is awesome. Though old, but it still fun to play solo or with friends and has replay value. Buy the DLC too, it's worth it!

6,Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,Played the heck out of this game on Xbox and PC. Takes all the awesome things about the first one and makes them even better. Think Rick and Morty if it was a looter shooter. And a DnD DLC? Awesome! A must cop!,49520
6,Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,hehe shoot me in the face,49520
6,Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"In spite of my overall recommended rating, there are some things that you should probably know about this game.
Firstly is the mechanism of the ""looter shooter"" part of the game. In order to actually farm for weapons and items, you have to re-enter a level from the main menu every single time; there is no boss respawn mechanic in levels, which makes this necessary part of the game sometimes incredibly frustrating. This is especially so when trying to get legendary loot.
There are mods (custom launchers) that fix this issue, but I shouldn't have to download a launcher - why isn't this part of the base game? It's a looter-shooter, how did they not expect people to need to farm the same boss or bosses over again? Thankfully for me, load times are amongst the shortest I've seen, but I know that will not be the case for everyone, which may make the experience even more gruelling. 

Another problem so far has been co-op play. The entirety of the way, I've been playing this with 3 other friends, which has made the experience considerably more difficult. How strange, given that this IS meant to be a co-op game. We frequently find ourselves underleveled for areas simply because playing in co-op splits the experience but doesn't adjust for 4 players. This sort of issue doesn't happen in singleplayer. Ironic.

My third and final gripe is the zer0 Sniper class, who I've been focusing on this entire time. I would briefly like to point out the stupidity of having a melee branch with no genuine melee weapons - asides from that, the Sniper class can feel quite redundant at times. Critical hitboxes are both small and in sometimes ridiculous places, or are totally not existent at all - and even when shot, do not crit properly. Many engagements are in close quarters, and when playing with 4 people, ""getting hurt"" animations can increase the difficulty in landing headshots.
I get this is going to be partially out of my own aim, but all the other factors can sometimes make Sniper Zer0 feel like a chore. 

As for the positives of this game...
+ The gunplay CAN feel amazing
+ There's an incredible addictiveness to getting good loot
+ Landing headshots CAN be satisfying
+ The game looks awesome even on the worst settings

So overall, I recommend it. Is it worth $20? Debatable, but I bought it only sale (only about $7) and I would say I'm satisfied with my purchase so far. I think fundamentally some of the game's design choices turned out to be poor, especially with so much DLC and the issues mentioned above; every game has it's flaws. 

In spite of those things, it is probably worth a try.

I've played some missions over and over again with different people, alone or some friends ( since i don't have many) and each experience was far away different from the first one just because those whom u play with are different. i got it yesterday and i was like okay lemme just see what I've got. ended up playing 10 hours straight..",49520

6,Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"This game has been one that I have dreaded playing for a long time... While I had heard that the game was amazing and a true masterpiece of the FPS RPG Genre I must admit that the artstyle was something that left a sour taste in my mouth as the visuals were particularly not my favourite. However I lost a bet with a friend years ago and he told me that as compensation I had to buy this game and one day do a runthrough with him to truly see what a masterpiece this game was, so I purchased it but still hadn't played it for some time. Then my roommate saw that I owned it and asked if he could use my Steam to play it on my PC every so often, even bought all the DLC shortly afterwards (minus the Commander Lilith DLC that leads into Borderlands 3 which i still have yet to obtain) just so he could play it not far from me while I was chilling on my Playstation or Xbox... And the jokes about this game, all over my facebook and all over my youtube for years even to the point that friends of mine made references to this game in D&D games that I was the Dungeon Master for... It seemed I could not escape my fate from this game, and so finally... as of about 8 days ago... I bit the bullet, got three of my mates, one who hadn't played before either and two that had, and we finally did a runthrough...

Now of my 104 hours that the review says I will admit that about 60 of them are actually mine, and the artstyle still annoys the hell out of me to this day BUT the rest of the game? Well it more than makes up for the artstyle's aggravation as this game is fun, hilarious and just left me with too many moments of joy, laughter and WTF episodes and my only regret is that in all honesty I should have played this sooner... I should have been shooting skag's in the mouth just as I left Highschool, I should have been beating down Psycho Midgets well before I moved towns and I sure as hell should have been cracking Handsome Jack's smug skull in WELL BEFORE I started university... But alas my stubbornness and that deplorable artstyle truly got in the way of this otherwise gem in the rough.

So thank you friend of mine for making that bet with me and forcing me to give it an honest go, for the hilarious moments were truly great, thank you players of my games for making references from well written lines and characters from this fantastic game, thank you best friends for joining me on this great crusade through Pandora and helping me to see the fun, thank you 2K for getting this game to all the boys and girls who really wanna smash Psycho's in the wasteland and thank you Gearbox and their staff members for taking the time to make this game as amazing and enjoyable as it is (minus the artists, i'm sorry but I cannot give you any praise as I can never personally forgive the style personally).

Now if you'll excuse me... I'm probably going to sink another 100 hours into this game at the very least and even play all the other sequels, prequels and predecessors with my friends to make up for lost time.

6,Borderlands 2,RPG,49520,"Waiting for steam summer sale to buy that last DLC for this game, so I decided to take a break from borderland 2 to play LRFF and a few other games. While waiting I decided to finish my review for this game first.

Some of the best games in my library I didn’t play yet because I am still missing DLC like Dishonored or Stellaris as I always want to try to get the full experience of a game before I move onto other backlogs in my libraries. Borderlands 2 has been burning a hole on my playlist for a long time because of missing DLCs. A lot friend told me to play with them for many years but without getting the DLC it just feels weird for me. 

Being released for a long time this game is still in very good Quality. Great map design, Story, funny dialogue with awesome voice acting and the little madness in everybody. The interface and gameplay itself are still high standard in today’s game world. Difficulty is a bit higher then needed as game is expected to be play with a bunch of friends. I recommend explore each map and do missions that’s at least 2 level below yours and keep it that way so you don’t have to die too much. 

Lucky for us there is skeleton chest that you can open with golden key you can find by searching internet. Upgrade your guns using that every 4-5 levels or so using it so you don’t have to depend on quest reward and loot drops. Currently there are about 230 keys still available to grab before they expire and they do release more from time to time.

I was unlucky enough that play through the entire game + 3 major DLC not a single legendary dropped for me but normal people does have better luck than I do. Ouch, I am going to go cry in a corner now and let’s finish this review quickly.

9.5/10 would be my final score for this game as a whole and once I have the last DLC I will play through the game again in new game+ and the other 3 major DLC that I haven’t touched yet. Recommend for anyone and everyone, if you haven’t play this get all expansion on a sale and play now, you need to know the entire Borderlands story as the whole series is going very strong and new games and new expansions are being made constantly. Adding Borderland 3 + all DLCs into my Wishlist right now.

The looter shooter that got me into the Borderlands universe. Among the witty one-liners, unique humor, intriguing story, and deep characters is some rather addictive gameplay. You can shoot bad guys. You can shoot your friends. You can shoot a gun that shoots guns that shoot your friends. Or bad guys. Sometimes the bad guys shoot each other. Sometimes the good guys shoot each other. The most handsome guy in the game is a bad guy. The most annoying character in the game is a good guy. There's a gun that screams. Like, vocal screaming. There are dudes that just scream in general. You can have all this just cause you feel like it.

Arguably the best entry to the Borderlands universe.

8,Hades,RPG,1145360,"After Playing Transistor and Bastion I understood that Supergiant games doesn't really follow the same formula of current game developers. They just make great games every time.

Gameplay is probably the most similar to Bastion of all Supergiant Games, crisp, responsive, fun, fast-paced, challenging (if you wish) and enjoyable.

Greek mythology is always interesting and the way it's implemented on character design, art, visuals, the history and its replayability, is brilliant. 
Character Design in Hades is so sick and probably the strongest point of the game, the re-imagination of Greek Gods in this cartoony/anime art style is so well done and I could fall in love with every character.

Voice acting is always really strong in Supergiant, I remember reading in an AMA that it took them three years to record 1 million lines of dialog, that just shows how much work and love they put in their games. The game is almost fully voice acted and it's incredible.

OST is [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFVjtvuVHpE] fucking amazing [/url] it remind me a lot of DOOM ost but its clearly different and lets you get absorbed by the atmosphere of the game, I would get hooked in a zone for the music alone.

8,Hades,RPG,1145360,"[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

Hades is an excellent game that deserves every bit of praise it receives. Play it. Even if you are not into action roguelikes or Greek mythology, this game is still worth trying out for the sake of an authentic experience.

[h1]Full Review[/h1]

Every so often, a dedicated and highly talented person or a group of people creates a masterpiece like any other – with their own vision, style, and storytelling. Hades is a game only Supergiant Games could make. It is monumental, both for the roguelike genre and as a video game in general; a must-play for everyone.

Let me start from afar. Video games as a medium are a way to escape unpleasant or uneventful everyday life. It is escapism, a necessary psychological device to divert thoughts from sadness, loss, or boredom. You can see it in every type of entertainment humans have, not merely video games. Likewise, roguelikes have deep roots in literal “escape” concerning their narrative (the hero always tries to escape a dungeon or labyrinth of sorts or even their fate). We might call it double escapism. At the same time, stories in most roguelikes only distantly resemble real-life situations. That is where Supergiant makes a difference. They not only create an addictive game with exceptional style and music, but they also tell a deeply allegorical coming-of-age story. You know, the type of story every one of us lives through at some point because there are no ideal families, as well as relationships. Maybe some will not see it like that, but this allegory penetrates every aspect of Hades. It returns you from the whimsical world (or should I say Underworld?) to your everyday life with new feelings, thoughts, and a desire to sort everything through. That is the highest praise I could imagine for an entertainment medium.

Hades follows the story of Zagreus and his relationship with his tyrant father, Hades, the god of the Underworld himself. I love Greek mythology and Ancient Greek literature, and I must admit the level of detail is brilliant. There are many myths from different sources; Supergiant chooses its interpretations very carefully, so the story feels consistent. They had a certain degree of freedom regarding the protagonist and his relations with everyone due to his lesser significance in Greek mythology. Even there, though, in late interactions with Dionysus, we can learn how the whole “Orphic Dionysus Zagreus” tradition might have an internal explanation. So, yeah, the level of detail is brilliant, I mean it! Zagreus, or Zag for short, is a young godling who wants to escape his dull life in the Underworld. Hades (the god) demands from his son, whom he scornfully calls “boy,” to be responsible, respectful, and obedient. At the same time, he is reluctant to show his love or appreciation. For Zag, there is only one way to deal with it: running away to relatives on Olympus. The problem, though, is that no one can escape the Underworld, even a godling! And so we start our desperate journey as Zag, trying to leave the domain of the dead. The story is deep and meaningful; its narration goes through many dialogs with different characters, intertwined between escape attempts into one whole piece. Slowly, the perspective shifts: the initial father-son conflict reveals underlying problems and broader themes. My favorite includes exercising honesty and outspokenness and why it is not always the best course of action in a manifold family to tell everything head-on.

Gameplay-wise, Hades is as addictive as a perfect roguelike should be. You have to rely on your wit, reaction (sometimes even sense of rhythm), and, of course, luck to fight your way through the ever-changing environment with hundreds of possible adjustments to strategy and tactics. I could play games like Crypt of the NecroDancer or Dicey Dungeons in short sessions, but Hades? Nope. I play it, and play it, and play it. Again and again. It is so very addictive! Different weapons, boons, power-ups, and their combinations result in some weird and powerful twists to efficient tactics, which is an example of RNG done right. If you die, you can start again a bit stronger (if you gathered enough Darkness, that is) through the process amusingly called Reflecting. Due to its core mechanics, the game can be frustrating, but that only means your character has not been powerful enough to beat something as of yet. Just play some more, and you will naturally overcome the obstacle. It starts to feel repetitive only when you finish the main story. At that point, the only way of raising the challenge is through the Pact of Punishment, a plot device to make your post-story runs harder.

As always with Supergiant, the voice acting and music are exceptional. Beautiful melodies combined with heavier riffs and reverberations suit the game’s style and story greatly. And when Orpheus (Darren Korb, the composer) and Eurydice (Ashley Barrett) start singing, their verses seem to be out of this world. It is not a simple task to assume the roles of the legendary musician and his muse and sing their parts convincingly. Somehow, Darren and Ashley pull it out. I had tears and goosebumps listening to In the Blood after finishing the game! Truly magnificent.

Lastly, I want to briefly mention the Fated List of Minor Prophecies which adds depth to the choice-making during escape attempts, and the detailed statistics menu for your runs. Little nuances like these contribute to the entire thing, making it much more enjoyable. And, well, there is also fishing. Because why not?",1145360

8,Hades,RPG,1145360,"Hades is a rougelike game that actually incorporates the concept of ""doing runs over and over"" in a way that makes sense into it's story. You're not just doing this because its a videogame, rather because in the context of the game its an actual mechanic and a ""normal behavior"".
In this game you will likely die in early chambers when you begin, but this is pretty much on par to how the game is designed, as you play more you will not only get better at handling Zagreus and learn enemy patterns, but also collect resources to make future runs easier, as you'll be able to permanently upgrade yourself, making future attempts more likely to succeed.
The main powers you acquire are derived from Olympian gods, each offering their own set of effects that you can equip to your main moves, or just gain passive buffs that might alter how you approach a given run, there's also 6 different weapons that can later even gain new alterations, even though the game encourages you to try all weapons by buffing the rewards you earn if you use a specific one during your next run, you might just find your favorite one and use it to achieve more victories.
The game also has a wide cast of charming characters that you'll be able to interact with during and before/after a run, deepening your relationship with each as you progress and eventually even unlocking sub stories related to them, allowing them to grow more as characters and friends of yours.
Overall this game is a great experience, and from popular word, even if you're unfamiliar with the rougelike genre, this game has proven to find their way to be liked by these people. There is a lot of extra unlockables you can pursue if you decide to, and the game even allows you to pump up the difficulty with set modifiers, to test the skill of those seeking for a greater challenge.

11,Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Destiny 2 is my favorite game and has been since its release. Here are some reasons why:

Pros
-Fun shooting and movement mechanics
-Awesome musical scores
-Beautiful world art and visuals
-A story that started out kinda vague but over the past few years has become much more engaging and intriguing
-A wide variety of weapons, abilities, and armor to choose from and experiment with
-campaigns (I find them fun, especially if it's your first time running through them)
-I really enjoy nightfalls, dungeons, and raids, each of which have varying levels of difficulty
-though may people have mixed thoughts on pvp, I still find it fun and like experimenting with different classes (though it is sorely needing some more updates)
-A community that while labeled as toxic by some, I have still made a lot of friends within
-Bungie keeps updating the game periodically, enough to keep me interested

Cons
-cheaters (though this is a rampant issue, I haven't run into them enough myself to make the experience too negative. Can't say the same for other people though)
-some weapon and ability metas (like stasis) can be a bit oppressive, and the nerfs that reign them in can take time
-content vaulting (though I understand why they do it) just sucks to see some stuff leave",1085660

11,Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"I think the world that bungie has built here is amazing. The lore and a lot of the story building in this game is incredible. On top of that, the gunplay is smooth, the classes are all good in their own ways, and the pve side of this game can be amazing. However, destiny is not a pvp game. Do not go into this game thinking it is going to be a good pvp game. Pvp is full of cheaters and people who haven't seen the sun in years because they were too busy using felwinter's lie on guardians in the crucible. The pve side of things, is much better though. Destiny most definitely has had its ups and downs, and I have taken many breaks from this game throughout the years. Honestly though, this game has a special place in my steam library. Unlike other games, I still remember the first exotic I ever got, I still remember the first time I ever cleared a raid, and I still remember playing gambit for countless hours to get a bow that I only used twice, but who could forget that right? In all seriousness, play this game. Read the lore, learn the characters, master the gunplay, but most of all, don't take the game to seriously or you will end up hating it with a passion.",1085660

I bought a year long pass because i want to see stuff as advertised in trailer to work as advertised in trailer but not your balance ruining the fun factor. 
Game looks great 
Game plays great except when their servers decide to mess with you randomly 
Game is rewarding in its own way 

But its bad investment of the time if i am grinding something because its awesome and when i get it ..since pvp community complains ..devs nerf it to ground in pve and vice versa .. I would really prefer if devs decide to balance PVE and PVP separately as everyone will be happy with their time invested . I will discontinue buying next expansions as i lost trust in the developers.

11,Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Cool concept but fails to execute any enjoyable content beyond the campaigns. DLCs are overpriced and the game is essentially unplayable without DLCs since most content is limited when playing for free. Kinda defeats the point of making the game free to play. Everyone I know who still plays this game doesn't enjoy it, I don't I understand why they keep playing the game, but they do. Do not download this game, it may be free but the cost of therapy will hit your wallet quite hard.

Just as some background, I have played the game for many hours when it was on Battle.net and purchased all the original campaigns. After the game went to Steam, I felt the quality of the game deteriorated severely and become entirely DLC dependent.",1085660

11,Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Unlike Destiny 1, this installment offers little innovation. There´s a basic model here that was implemented on all expansions, on every stage of Destiny 2 to date:

1) Make a great introductory mission, get players hooked.
2) Make a few updates
3) Copy and paste activities and missions.

From the start this game had no soul, no love at all.

Really different experience from Destiny 1. Played the demo, it sucked but the introductory mission was great. Thought to myself ""Well, D1 was great, let´s give it a chance"".

Wrong decision! Not going to lie, it has some good moments and pvp is still fun. Some strikes and raids are fun as well, that´s why it has the score it has, but wow...it´s years behind the first one in the fun factor.

If I have to congratulate Bungie in any area, that would be in the marketing department. EXCELLENT trailers.",1085660

11,Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Cool concept but fails to execute any enjoyable content beyond the campaigns. DLCs are overpriced and the game is essentially unplayable without DLCs since most content is limited when playing for free. Kinda defeats the point of making the game free to play. Everyone I know who still plays this game doesn't enjoy it, I don't I understand why they keep playing the game, but they do. Do not download this game, it may be free but the cost of therapy will hit your wallet quite hard.

Just as some background, I have played the game for many hours when it was on Battle.net and purchased all the original campaigns. After the game went to Steam, I felt the quality of the game deteriorated severely and become entirely DLC dependent.",1085660

11,Destiny 2,Action,1085660,"Unlike Destiny 1, this installment offers little innovation. There´s a basic model here that was implemented on all expansions, on every stage of Destiny 2 to date:

1) Make a great introductory mission, get players hooked.
2) Make a few updates
3) Copy and paste activities and missions.

From the start this game had no soul, no love at all.

Really different experience from Destiny 1. Played the demo, it sucked but the introductory mission was great. Thought to myself ""Well, D1 was great, let´s give it a chance"".

Wrong decision! Not going to lie, it has some good moments and pvp is still fun. Some strikes and raids are fun as well, that´s why it has the score it has, but wow...it´s years behind the first one in the fun factor.

If I have to congratulate Bungie in any area, that would be in the marketing department. EXCELLENT trailers.",1085660

Most of the time, Tomb Raider feels like a press and hold W interactive movie followed by a couple of quick time events. There is nothing wrong about it if the ""movie"" is good, and Tomb Raider is a good one.

There is no real difficulty to it, so I recommend it to everyone who has started in the gaming world as a first game, you can learn the basics of movement, quick time events, upgrades, exploration and combat. It has a good enough story about becoming stronger, facing sacrifice and make it worth it. And Lara Croft (reboot) is a truly memorable character that has gained a place in modern gaming history.

Explosions, non-stop action, Japanese temples, samurai-demons (Oni), tombs awaiting to be raided and a young Lara Croft that slowly transforms into the real definition of a strong survivor and a knowledge-thirsty adventurer.

A 2013 Triple-A game that aged very well. Graphics look good and mechanics are still fresh and solid.

12,Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"1. There are no tombs in Tomb Raider.

2. Lara Croft is a mass murdering psychopath whining about shooting a man, before killing all his mates immediately after.  Lara killed people in previous Tomb Raider games as well, but the way this game presents it, it falls narratively flat and is impossible to empathize with.  Maybe they should have saved this part of her development for the second or third title, or had her be a Batman style hero who doesn't kill.  But nope, Action sells.

3. We know Tomb Raider was build on large, desolate environments, ancient tombs and mythological settings and the wonder of exploring them.  There were some missteps in the franchise but it usually returned to form.  This game: here's World War II island, Bear Grylls kills 10 men with a single arrow and then bombs a dozen more.

4. The game is a Lara Croft torture and death simulator, I guess that makes some people happy.

It's alright for what it is, which is a third-person action game, but for someone looking for a great Tomb Raider game, Lara Croft is for all intents dead.  If this is what we get from now on, and the best Tomb Raider game we get is a top-down twin-stick shooter that nails the feel and spirit of the franchise better than a triple A blockbuster like this, then I am very sad indeed.

I'd have no problem playing a female-led Splinter Cell game, but I don't want a sneaking, murdering Sam Fisher in my Tomb Raider game.

Lara Croft was always a female Indiana Jones.  This Lara is a female Nathan Drake, which is ironic because Uncharted was imitating Tomb Raider.

Also why did they release a graphical upgrade for the 'next-gen' console systems but they left us with this Lara who looks nothing like her cutscene representations?",203160
12,Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Motion Sickness Warning: Lara Croft jogs make the camera shake as if Lara was a giant.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The premise is really good, stranded on an island ruled by a supernatural entity that causes weird storms and is worshiped by your enemies.
When you start out is really feels like your making your way into a inhospitable place at the edge of your capabilities. You feel as if the entity is watching you by striking at you with lightning as the rain is pouring down to make you lose your grip and fall to your death.

By the time morning rolls around its all gone.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game just becomes 3rd person action game were you go about cleaning the island of it's enemies. No more supernatural enemies or mystery just Call Of Duty soldiers with rifles, shotguns and shields.
I do not understand like what happened in the development, there so many ideas:
- when you get to the beach it becomes clear that the island has been stranding peoples from all eras, pirates, merchants, WW2 soldiers etc. Why don't you fight against multiple different groups each seeking a different goal.
- the game is set in multiple environments but the they all kinda feel the same, like you don't feel the altitude at all.
The game is supposed to be set in the mountains but there is no point were you have to follow a narrow path going up and risking to fall, for the majority of the game if you look down you will see the generic walkable ground and not some vista of the mountains. In fact most of the levels seem to be cornered of somehow, I do not remember ever falling out of the level at it's edge.
- the platforming, the core traversal mechanic (actually jogging is core traversal mechanic in practice) is boring.
It's the same Prince Of Persia/Uncharted style of ledge grabing were you can go and make yourself a coffe while Lara is holding on to the edge.
There is no skill involved in traversal, no puzzle of what ledges you need to grab in order to reach your destination because most traversal sections are one way only and no timing skill you don't have to time you jumps at all you just need to reach the end of the ledge.
I think you can do most of the platforming with just one finger because Lara doesn't seem to jump farther if jump while running. I don't remember ever having to jump further that before (I write this review some time later though after playing the game).

[h1]Portraial[/h1]
I usually don't care as much and I am not a fan of the old games but after taking a break from the game and playing Batman Arkham City I couldn't help noticing some stuff:
- why is Lara for the entire game portrait as weak, like you can be on the beach level near the end fully equipped, leveled up, 3 digit kill count and having overcome some stuff but her expression is ""afraid please help me"".
You would think after killing people by driving her pickaxe into their skulls and after rising from blood she should be more like Rambo: First Blood, a predator.
Why do Crysis 2, Batman: Arkham Knight and Far Cry get to have confident characters from the start and throughout the game.
- why does Lara need to suffer and look injured ALL THE TIME to prove she is strong (wash your face and change clothes there a plenty of downed enemies).
I have not played a game were your character get ping ponged so much into everything.
Did you really need to have fatalities for all deaths including from the enemies ? it's not a horror game.
- you could be at 95% of the game and Lara still says to herself ""You can do it Lara"".
Do you think Batman says to himself encouragements or do you think his enemies need encouragements to face Batman.

In the end it's meh.",203160
12,Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Tomb Raider 2013, fairly old now in 2021 at 8 years old, but I'm glad to say it's still amazing.

The graphics are beautiful, and don't make the game feel old at all; and the soundtrack is pretty decent for the type of game that Tomb Raider is.

The story is decent, there's nothing too special about it - just another survivor story, really, but what makes this different is the way the story is presented. The map is open, and you can mostly go wherever you want except for a few story parts. The gameplay is fairly well flowing as well, there are very few and very short load times between parts of a map, and they're mostly hidden behind cutscenes.

Combat is OK, it can get quite repetitive with enemies repeating the same attacks over and over, and it can get quite monotonous. Mechanics in the game are great, and the game doesn't give you a huge tutorial at the start - one mechanic is only given at the very end-game, which is nice.

Overall, other than a few minor complaints (as listed above), the game is great. I didn't find any bugs at all. 

Definitely recommend this to anyone thinking of buying it! I'd give this game a solid 8/10.",203160
12,Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,Appreciate this game developer very much for making a very beautifully made action game for Lara Croft. Will definitely buy the rest. Awesome!,203160
12,Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Honestly, I was floored by how good this game was. I thought it looked interesting and enjoyed the original 90s games when I was a kid so I decided to give it a try. It's so well done. The story is really interesting and significantly above average for games these days, the game itself is stunning, the controls feel incredibly natural and the voice acting is brilliant. Little things like how enemies do not respawn once you've killed them makes going back to previous zones to explore every nook and cranny a joy. You can upgrade your weapons but the crafting system isn't overly complex. Lara herself is just incredibly acted, modelled, animated and written. You really watch her grow from a frightened girl to a wrathful killing machine and you feel the anger build along with her as you play through.",203160
12,Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"back in these days the devs actually knew what they were doing. an important thing to realise about this one is that it is not an offical part of the Tomb Raider IP, it is doing its own special thing on the side but is still under the same umbrella as the originals.",203160
12,Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"This is the first Tomb Raider game I've played, besides something on a gameboy color I never finished. My playtime is competing the story and a few tombs (tombs are side mission puzzles). I probably won't be replaying it anytime soon, but I enjoyed most of the playthrough very much.

This is a movie game. Quick time events, running on platforms that are crumbling with every step, and LOTS AND LOTS OF CLIMBING. Alternate title could be Rock Climber Simulator 2013 (laugh). 

The combat was good, with four different guns with upgrades. I really wouldn't call this a third person shooter, but yeah there's a lot. The next thing is the climbing. I'm going to be honest, I love platformers, and I loive the sections where you're climbing up a deteriorating bridge and stuff, but sometimes climbing rocks feels tedious.

I liked the story, it was simple, the cutscenes didn't go on too long and the cinematic gameplay is some of the best I've seen. Overall, this game was great, I got it for only $2.24, I will definitely think about buying the sequels.",203160
12,Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Tomb Raider is not a perfect game but it's definitely worth a shot!

1. Music: 2/10
2. Story: 6.5/10
3. Level Design 10/10
4. Gameplay 9/10

The game is really good, it progresses really nicely, the characters are all well thought out, the level design is great and intractable, and game mechanics are nice and unique. But sadly it does have some downsides, for example the auditory experience of the game is nothing to write home about (its just downright boring). And while the story is good, the beginning and the end of it don't really contrast well. And for a 2013 game the enemy AI seems very robotic and outdated.

7/10 - Overall Tomb Raider is a great game and you should give it a try! 

Side note: This is a relatively old game so it should run good on slower hardware in my case it ran at a consistent 60fps on my mx130 laptop on the lowest settings.",203160

12,Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Honestly, I was floored by how good this game was. I thought it looked interesting and enjoyed the original 90s games when I was a kid so I decided to give it a try. It's so well done. The story is really interesting and significantly above average for games these days, the game itself is stunning, the controls feel incredibly natural and the voice acting is brilliant. Little things like how enemies do not respawn once you've killed them makes going back to previous zones to explore every nook and cranny a joy. You can upgrade your weapons but the crafting system isn't overly complex. Lara herself is just incredibly acted, modelled, animated and written. You really watch her grow from a frightened girl to a wrathful killing machine and you feel the anger build along with her as you play through.",203160
12,Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"back in these days the devs actually knew what they were doing. an important thing to realise about this one is that it is not an offical part of the Tomb Raider IP, it is doing its own special thing on the side but is still under the same umbrella as the originals.",203160
12,Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"This is the first Tomb Raider game I've played, besides something on a gameboy color I never finished. My playtime is competing the story and a few tombs (tombs are side mission puzzles). I probably won't be replaying it anytime soon, but I enjoyed most of the playthrough very much.

This is a movie game. Quick time events, running on platforms that are crumbling with every step, and LOTS AND LOTS OF CLIMBING. Alternate title could be Rock Climber Simulator 2013 (laugh). 

The combat was good, with four different guns with upgrades. I really wouldn't call this a third person shooter, but yeah there's a lot. The next thing is the climbing. I'm going to be honest, I love platformers, and I loive the sections where you're climbing up a deteriorating bridge and stuff, but sometimes climbing rocks feels tedious.

I liked the story, it was simple, the cutscenes didn't go on too long and the cinematic gameplay is some of the best I've seen. Overall, this game was great, I got it for only $2.24, I will definitely think about buying the sequels.",203160
12,Tomb Raider,Adventure,203160,"Tomb Raider is not a perfect game but it's definitely worth a shot!

1. Music: 2/10
2. Story: 6.5/10
3. Level Design 10/10
4. Gameplay 9/10

The game is really good, it progresses really nicely, the characters are all well thought out, the level design is great and intractable, and game mechanics are nice and unique. But sadly it does have some downsides, for example the auditory experience of the game is nothing to write home about (its just downright boring). And while the story is good, the beginning and the end of it don't really contrast well. And for a 2013 game the enemy AI seems very robotic and outdated.

7/10 - Overall Tomb Raider is a great game and you should give it a try! 

Side note: This is a relatively old game so it should run good on slower hardware in my case it ran at a consistent 60fps on my mx130 laptop on the lowest settings.",203160

Instead, i'll share the fact that I have 1001 hours logged on this game at the time of writing this review. So I like it at least 1001 hours' worth. In closing: play this game, it is good. Thank you for your time.",105600
15,Terraria,Adventure,105600,"This game saved my life.

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you Re-Logic.",105600

Terraria is a classic. It has loads of bosses, weapons, armor, items, etc. Their is a thing for everyone in this game. There is a vast building system, a huge combat system, and more. This game is only $10 and it goes on sale often. If you haven't played this game yet, give it a try. It is super cheap, and is one of my favorite games EVER. One con is that their is large amount of rng in this game. Their are a lot of items that are very very rare. However, you don't actually need to grind that much.",105600
15,Terraria,Adventure,105600,"One of those games that you keep coming back to. So many things to do and really fun with friends, this game will never lose it's charm. Excellent modding community aswell.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Terraria is a classic. It has loads of bosses, weapons, armor, items, etc. Their is a thing for everyone in this game. There is a vast building system, a huge combat system, and more. This game is only $10 and it goes on sale often. If you haven't played this game yet, give it a try. It is super cheap, and is one of my favorite games EVER. One con is that their is large amount of rng in this game. Their are a lot of items that are very very rare. However, you don't actually need to grind that much.",105600
15,Terraria,Adventure,105600,"One of those games that you keep coming back to. So many things to do and really fun with friends, this game will never lose it's charm. Excellent modding community aswell.

16,The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"Words can simply not describe how much I love this game, but will certainly do my best:

Characters - Existing characters such as Geralt, Triss, Ciri, Dandelion, Yen, Keira (plus Shani and Regis for the expansions) have been utilized brilliantly from the source material and used so well in the world the game has created, and boy what a world it is! The characters I previously mentioned are probably the ones that stood out for me the most, but to be honest there are so many brilliantly constructed characters (even minor ones like Bart the Rock Troll) that I simply don't know where to even begin... Geralt's interaction with most them is simply brilliant, and the game has so many amazing, memorable moments because of it (including the famous 'drinking game segment' at Kaer Morgen). You also get a logged back story for each character, most of it taken from the books and/or previous games. which is brilliant if, like me, you decided to read the books afterwards or couldn't be bothered playing through the first couple of Witcher games (although I did get through 3 stages of the original game). It's obviously more important to have this as there is alot of stuff in the game that needs back story to elaborate on, weither it be a situation or certain dialogue. Oh yes the dialogue, love love love some of conversations in this game. You can tell alot of thought and effort went into it. The character dialogue for the most part, particularly for Geralt is so complex and funny. As it is with certain other characters mind you, but Geralt's obviously stands out the most

Environment - The graphics and art design for all the environments are simply brilliant, each location had its own distinctive feel and is and absolute joy to explore (I spent about 2 weeks just exploring Skellege's oceans and vast landscapes)

Monsters/Enemies - Such a huge assorted variety, honestly you can never get bored with the variety of enemies you face. I also love that each monster has it's own unique methods of quickly being dispelled, and everytime you discover something a description will pop up in the beast log, breaking up everything into different categories aswell

Story - Soooo gooood. Honestly story elements wise, I don't think any game is going to even come remotely close. Especially given that so many of the side stories actually match, and even sometimes exceed, the complexity and epicness of the main storyline

Combat - Kept interesting through the graphic, stylized fighting and dismemberment. Aswell as the additional use of things like signs and potions. Once again you usually need to use certain combinations of things to kill my monsters more easily, particularly the more defined 'boss level' ones

Expansions - BRILLIANT. Hearts of Stone has truely amazing story and character elements. While Blood and Wine does this on a slightly lower scale but adds another beautiful environment with various new enemies to face

So basically this the best I can do to some up how epic The Witcher 3 is. But honestly, just play the damn game!!!

You know, there are some special games that you feel empty when finished. I guess that's how I feel right now.

There are missions that balance the border between funny and seriousness very well. It is a game that I started late but never tired of playing. I guess it's like a game series that I will play again and again after a certain time. At least it's worth seeing Geralt again ^^",292030
16,The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"What is the premise of life and how is it intertwined with destiny? Some believe that their existence is to perform grand deeds, whilst others contentedly was little girls in basins, an occupation that I earnestly desire. Geralt was one of these men who had a destiny, a goal to slaughter the mentally handicapped, whilst venturing off to pollinate with their caregivers. His aim and dedication in slaughtering the mentally deficient earnt him the ire of various human rights committees who dubbed him the White Wolf, a name inspired by his peculiar habits of skinning his prey alive, to then don them as a cloak. Geralt’s work was so effective that many, from a petulant child, to a mother, fatigued with cleaning out her handicapped child’s waste, and having to spoon fed him intangible jellies as sustenance, frequently contracted the White Wolf to slaughter whatever mouth drivelling, rabid imbecile was assigned. Often the contractors that hired Geralt to slaughter the handicapped were families, or a fuming neighbour, disgruntled over being nightly woken by a mentally handicapped banshee, slamming together two frying pans at the stroke of midnight, whilst serenading an incoherent, intelligible tune. On other occasions he was assigned high profile contracts, most prominently of them all, was the bellower of Castle Whistlewood, a contract he was issues by an individual who wishes to remain anonymous. 

The bellower of Castle Whislewood, otherwise regarded as Steven Dawson, was a distant relative of Austin Powers and was generally emotionally volatile, mentally decrepit simpleton with Tourette’s and Autism. Frequently the belower would trail after woman and utter guttural howls, coupled in with vehement obscenities such as “Hello Baby” and “Ding Dong”. All Geralt would have to do is attach an inflatable female doll, scantily clad and with a seductive pose, to a cliff face. In theory, the imbecile, observing such a hedonistic toy would wholeheartedly believe that the woman was genuine and as such would rush towards her, tripping along the way and plummeting to his demise. Unfortunately, this was not a typical case. Steven Dawson was the governing monarch of Castle Whistlewood, an enclosed building, barred away from civilisaiton and comprised of solely him and his thralls. His thralls in question were regarded as the NDSP, the National Disability Support Partners and were sworn to defend him to their dying day. This task would be relatively difficult to complete, as the bellower bore an army at his disposal, one that could call for security and otherwise repel an ill prepared assault if need be. Aware of such a fact, Geralt began to psychologically and mentally prepare. To ward of the evil spirits, he clad himself and his blades in the finest baby oils that Poland had to offer. Then he acquired a mallet to crack open the bellowers skull. Alongside the weapon, four shrapnel grenades were concocted, in the event that Geralt would be required to clear out a throng of adversaries. During preparation, Geralt simultaneously observed national disability adverts, as they left him with an inexplicable rage. After his preparation was complete, Geralt consumed a vial of LSD, bearing tinges of methamphetamine and wade his way into the castle. The initial threat that Geralt encountered was at the hands of a busty, smirking and chipper female, who was situated at the front desk. The female, upon sighting Geralt, began grinning manically, exclaiming, “Hi there, my name is Caroline, how may I help you today?” Geralt, could not believe it, this female was attempting to seduce him, he could envision it plain in her eyes, her desire to bear his offspring was ever present. Fortunately, prior to entering the facility he had warded himself from all incantations and trickery and as such saw through her ploy. The female, sensing Geralts reluctance to answer, jubilantly stated, “Hi there, are you aware that this you are in the disability support partners facility?” These words, thank the dear heavens, were the last that she ever uttered, as Geralt, desiring to elude being captivated by the seductress, hurled a shrapnel grenade at her head, likely slaughtering her instantly. Then, withdrawing a sword and raising aloft a Polish flag, he began his ascent into the hagravens fortress that Steven Dawson called home. 

Many of the harlots were slaughtered before Geralt encountered his prey. The man, Steven Dawson, was in the midst of serenading to a photograph of a blonde female. The ballad appeared self improvise, as it bore numerous raunchy lyrics and his personal depraved sexual fantasies. Geralt, being unable to endure the sirens wail for a moment more, crept up behind the bellower and promptly caved in his skull with the matter, whilst piercing his chest with a blade. Thus, the contract of the bellower was completed, with Geralt returning to his contractor with the head as evidence of the deed. Afterwards, Geralt’s reputation in the eyes of the world irrevocably altered. Many perceived him as a hero, shielding civilization from the handicapped, whilst more insidious, clandestine groups, such as the NDSP and the UNESCO vilified Geralt, condemning him on his history of virtuous acts. As such, in completing this contract, Geralt had invoked the rage of various sinister groups. Frequently, Geralt throughout roaming in various realms, such as Temeria, Novigrad and the sort was hounded by priests sent by the Catholic Church, security forces, spokespersons for the United Nations and most mobs of depraved fiends who preached about human rights. In typical Geralt fashion he slaughtered them all, whilst locating their families to seduce and copulate with.

Overall, I appreciate the plot of the Witcher 3 and have immensely enjoyed slaughtering those who are inept at tying their own shoelaces, let along being able to cognitively contemplate. Furthermore, I appreciate the games symbolism by masquerading the handicapped as fearsome abominations, bearing horns, leathery skin, bristling aggression and solely conversing in guttural howls, as it wholly depicts the fact that the handicapped are not genuinely human, but are merely abominations that perpetually teeter along the edge of insanity. In summary, Witcher 3 is a grand game and I endear all onlookers to engage upon it immediately, lest you wish to never engage in your deep rooted, primalistic desires to assault the disabled.

Thus, the contract of the bellower was completed, with Geralt returning to his contractor with the head as evidence of the deed. Afterwards, Geralt’s reputation in the eyes of the world irrevocably altered. Many perceived him as a hero, shielding civilization from the handicapped, whilst more insidious, clandestine groups, such as the NDSP and the UNESCO vilified Geralt, condemning him on his history of virtuous acts. As such, in completing this contract, Geralt had invoked the rage of various sinister groups. Frequently, Geralt throughout roaming in various realms, such as Temeria, Novigrad and the sort was hounded by priests sent by the Catholic Church, security forces, spokespersons for the United Nations and most mobs of depraved fiends who preached about human rights. In typical Geralt fashion he slaughtered them all, whilst locating their families to seduce and copulate with.

Overall, I appreciate the plot of the Witcher 3 and have immensely enjoyed slaughtering those who are inept at tying their own shoelaces, let along being able to cognitively contemplate. Furthermore, I appreciate the games symbolism by masquerading the handicapped as fearsome abominations, bearing horns, leathery skin, bristling aggression and solely conversing in guttural howls, as it wholly depicts the fact that the handicapped are not genuinely human, but are merely abominations that perpetually teeter along the edge of insanity. In summary, Witcher 3 is a grand game and I endear all onlookers to engage upon it immediately, lest you wish to never engage in your deep rooted, primalistic desires to assault the disabled.

17,The Forest,Adventure,242760,"This game saved my life.

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

18,ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Ark - Its hard to describe. 

Is it fun. Yep, if your doing your own server your going to really enjoy it. 

If your on official servers PVE.  The servers tend to accumulate a 10/1 Chineese to Other player base.  They will make massive structures and put out max dino's most the time.  This will cause some servers to crash so often that the EU/NA players can't even use the servers. 

For example GenOne.  There are servers that are 9000 days where the other servers are now hitting 10000 days in game.  That means 1/10 of the time more probably more the server was rebooting, destroying play time of players, and causing transferred characters to be deleted.   I believe wildcard tried to region restrict the servers a while back but failed to accomplish this simple task.  It actually cause more Chineese to move to NA servers for example, MANY more. 

SO worst part of the game, severe lag.  If your unlucky enough to find one where the BOX tribes took over. Its going to be MUCH worse.    

I'll still give the game 4.5/5 but be warned.  Ask before building on a server.  The lag spikes and crashes can be extreme.  Also if the server is 500+ days behind its other near numbered brothers... Its a lagbomb/crasher that probably has some box tribe exploit base built inside a restricted area causing it to crash often as people try to use it.

18,ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I desperately want to like this game. On paper, it's everything I could ask for. Dinosaurs and prehistoric beasts! Taming, equipping, feeding them! Going exploring with epic mounts and hunting companions! Gradually building up a base that rivals the grandest of fortresses!

I want to like this game, but it's just too damn buggy. I was able to tolerate it for a while, where it would be frustrating but I could deal. The lost dinosaurs, the clipping, the stupid deaths, the building issues, whatever.

But then my prized Sarcosuchus ended up instantly dying when I was swimming and happened to brush the shoreline. I was very upset, but I went out and captured another one. Then, about five minutes after taming the new one, the exact same thing happened again.

It turns out the the Sarcosuchus's natural sprint speed is fast enough that it insta-kills it if it touches the shoreline, because for some reason the sprint speed is converted to fall damage. The solution to this bug? Just don't sprint, or don't use the Sarcosuchus. A known issue since 2018 that far as I know still hasn't been fixed. Just one of many user complaints that have not been addressed, and it was the last straw for me.

There's so much to like in this game, but the lack of polish just ends up ruining the experience. And it's such a tragedy, because this could really have been my most played game of all time.",346110

18,ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"I still remember the first time I played this game. I started out on a solo server. Had no clue what I was doing since there was no tutorial at the time, and the game was in early stages. Chain died to dilo's, raptors. Made a small shit shack out of wood. Huddled in a dark corner in pitch darkness hoping my stuff wasn't going to get destroyed by the raptors outside. Fought my way through them by cheesing them using elevation to my advantage. Found my first high lvl dino 120 trike (Max lvl at the time). Took 6 hours to tame with hand picked berries and narcotics to try and keep it down. More raptors kept spawning and trying to get at my trike buddy, but I prevailed. Tamed out only a few levels higher, due to harassment from the raptors. That thing was a beast, ripped through alpha raptors with constant knock back. Killed tons of carnos. Until an alpha rex snuck up on me in pitch darkness and ate my poor buddy. 

I thought I was ready for pvp after that experience gained. Spawned on the beach and went for the same spot to build my wood shack. At the time the alpha tribe of the server was pretty close (Server 1) Veras Vanguard. They came with argies and forcefully told me to relocate my shit shack somewhere else. I said NAH! Instantly picked off by the argy and went for a ride of a life time from a cliff to my death. I chucked a few sling shot rocks at their dinos and killed a few of them off. Merely to be a pest in my sorrow because of my base being ruined. 

This was when I realized to make it anywhere in pvp I must join a tribe to survive. At the time I heard Spartans was a big tribe and Barrys Seals. I felt more welcome in Seals, so that's where my pvp experience began. Raiding other mega tribes, killing countless dinos and players. That's what makes this game great, playing it with other people and creating a community around it.

Ark as a game is a rollercoaster ride. You always have your ups and downs. It's the best survival game I have ever played. The others don't come close to it. The things that make this game so epic is when you think you made it far and can't possibly be killed ark will always say ""Hold my beer"" as it proceeds to reap your soul from your body with a carefully planted troodon. Or an underwater scorpion that knocks you out before you could even shit your pants. Or another player sneaking up on you and smacking you over the head with a club. 

I started on pvp server and ignored the story completely. From a beach bob to a semi-big tribe to a mega. Each had its stories and community of people. Made some friends, enemies which both lead to epic battles.

This game has its share of countless bugs, I wish the developers spent more time fixing those before proceeding to create more content and DLC's. 

As a whole I would recommend this game to people, but know what kind of player you are. PVP is mostly for people who have a large community and can take turns looking after bases, and mostly ignore the story of the game. PvE is more geared for casual players who don't have the time to maintain bases against others and just want to experience the story of the game or RP away with mods.

18,ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Note: I play on official (PvE) servers. If you pick up this game I recommend looking for a private server or renting your own. Can be fun and has a lot of potential but I can't give it a positive review for the official server experience- for a game that requires a huge amount of time to be sunk in to progress, it's beyond frustrating that you can lose literally hundreds of hours of work to bugs and random server glitches. GMs will try to be helpful (if they respond at all), but you'll likely be told there is nothing that can be done. Servers are insanely laggy, especially on world-save intervals, and you will likely have multiple crashes and rollbacks a day depending on which server you are on. It's not uncommon for a server to go down for days at a time.

Recently my tribe had half of our cryofridges go dead despite being powered and on the same grid as others that were fine and fully charged, and we lost all the dinos (hundreds in total) in them. Might not be a big deal for larger tribes with more people who can recover more easily, but we are only two people. Losing a fridge full of Gigas we had raised and fully imprinted was a huge bummer, not to mention a bunch of event color dinos that we won't have access to for another year.

Bugs like that and many more have been documented for years now and they *still* exist, that's pretty unacceptable given how much of a grind it is to do anything in ARK. I see the appeal in the game, and I might still play casually... but I'm no longer sinking that time and dedication into a game that will only fuck me over in the long run, and I won't be buying ARK 2 unless Wildcard really turn themselves around.

     It is an mmo after all, much of the experience is derived from the other players of the game and although I have made some friends through playing I don't think I could recommend this game to people for the following criticism: extreme unbalance in public servers. Making dinos transferable is one of the worst decisions made by the ark team and although it is available to be turned off in server settings, many if not all of the official serves do not do so. This doesn't seem like a problem until someone from another server comes in with a end game, max level dino, flattens a whole server and then leaves again in a raid style. For this very reason people flock to dead servers to try to build up then go raid another server and then return to their 'safe' server where they can't be touched.

     In terms of performance, the game runs fine, if resource heavy. Graphics are alright, other than the blinding bloom and sun shafts, which cannot be adjusted to my knowledge other than through the gamma level and can be prevented from being adjusted server-side.

     For play with a group of friends on your own server, I think this game could be perfect, but it is not viable to play with the general public as of this very moment.",346110

However, the game is sometimes extremely rough around the edges.

If you're the type of player who can look past some flaws and stick with a game simply due to the theme or feel appealing to you more than usual, I'd recommend giving this a go.
If, on the other hand, polish, quality and user experience are paramount, maybe try this at a deep deep sale or simply do not even pick it up.

If you do decide to pick it up, ask around for a friend who knows their way around all the different map options and server parameters etc. because those can also very much change your experience, and make or break the game for you!

18,ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"Ark - Its hard to describe. 

Is it fun. Yep, if your doing your own server your going to really enjoy it. 

If your on official servers PVE.  The servers tend to accumulate a 10/1 Chineese to Other player base.  They will make massive structures and put out max dino's most the time.  This will cause some servers to crash so often that the EU/NA players can't even use the servers. 

For example GenOne.  There are servers that are 9000 days where the other servers are now hitting 10000 days in game.  That means 1/10 of the time more probably more the server was rebooting, destroying play time of players, and causing transferred characters to be deleted.   I believe wildcard tried to region restrict the servers a while back but failed to accomplish this simple task.  It actually cause more Chineese to move to NA servers for example, MANY more. 

SO worst part of the game, severe lag.  If your unlucky enough to find one where the BOX tribes took over. Its going to be MUCH worse.    

I'll still give the game 4.5/5 but be warned.  Ask before building on a server.  The lag spikes and crashes can be extreme.  Also if the server is 500+ days behind its other near numbered brothers... Its a lagbomb/crasher that probably has some box tribe exploit base built inside a restricted area causing it to crash often as people try to use it.  

5000 hours+ played, it is very fun if you find the right server.   Also pre-Transfer you will really enjoy official servers.  After that though the box tribes will cause havoc as they migrate massive numbers of structures and vaults to the server.",346110

I can see how one influences another, but the story mode isn't harmed so Online can exist, you’re not going to be harassed by any micro transactions while on singleplayer. The Online is just a choice by definition, you even have the option to turn off friend’s invites. There will be no propaganda of other games in the menu either, like Ubisoft and Capcom usually do. There is no immersion breaking items demanding you to PRETEND they aren't there.

I was afraid of buying this because I was skeptical that a game could be better than RDR1 with John Marston. I also avoided it due the highly inflated price in my country (bolsonaro vai tomar no cú). The current sellout discount this month was my best chance. This game is a perfected RDR1 if such witchery is even possible.

If you’re not an immersive gamer, you’ll learn to be. There are a lot of gameplay mechanics to suit every gamer but they’re so intuitive and sophisticated, it tends to incentivize you to adjust to a survival hybrid. You can be the good-bad guy (the canon R* expects from you), be a chill Boomhauer or just be the bad-bad guy. Sneak, bomb, kill, hunt, whatever you wish or if chaos suits you, even the smallest of things got a lot to show as you have probably heard already.

Now while the Online game preserves some of it, surely isn't the same direction. You can fully customize a character but he/she lacks voice for logical reasons, thus no substance (it has story progression) but things are much less dense & less interesting for me. Not my thing to wait for unpredictable randoms, but fun-guarantee with known friends. Again, it is a different driving force in there that requires a mood I don't always have.

When it comes to feelings however, assuming you were convinced to accept the story's pace, you'll have time to feel incredible moments and to see beautiful places, especially with decent graphics. Not everything will depend on it though, only a few games can break the boundary between here and “there” merely by some flow.

Many tribes consider wolves to be related to humans, because of the wolf’s dedication to its pack. Loneliness can trigger immersion, sometimes it is the world or the time period, sometimes it's everything combined. RDR2 story mode has all that, but it also adds bounding. A gang can trigger unique immersion, until the point of feeling at home, then you know the writer was inspired, voice and body actors were on fire and the development team resonated. As important as “your people” are, so must be “your foe”, giving reasons and further tightening that bounding.

This isn’t my first time feeling it. Comradery is also in many other games like Mass Effect, Republic Commando, FC Primal, even Lost and Damned and Cyberpunk nomads living in my soul. But it is definitely the first time I feel it in my blood.

If you wish to get high with such sweet endorphins, you can start by dealing with what you don't believe. Like killing, brawling or robbing imprudently (you will do that a lot) or fall to redemption. Of course I despise gangsters but I can see why they can't fit in. So, it is easy to find spatial immersion, but easy to get it busted too. Someone may storm your room, maybe your neighbor is a noisy ass messing with your focus or perhaps your cat is very sick today. Until they’re gone or if you go fix them, and of course, you must pay attention to the story 😂 If you think immersion is for crazies, here’s what [b]J.R.R. Tolkien[/b] once said about the importance of suspension of disbelief;

[i]""[The author] makes a secondary world which your mind can enter. Inside it, what he relates is true: it accords with the laws of that world. You therefore believe it, while you are, as it were inside. The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather art, has failed. You are then out in the primary world again, looking at the little abortive secondary world from outside.""[/i]

There are enough reviews out there that tell you that this game is a [b]very good game.[/b]

The usual points being that the game is a slow burn.
That's true because it [b]is.[/b]

But it is made to be that way so that you have time to slowly get to know the characters that are introduced to you. Slowly you begin to form your own biases and conclusions for each character as Arthur interacts with them.

You make decisions that will impact how everyone sees you and how everyone will treat you. Though I would have wanted to explore that a bit more, your decisions are gonna be influenced by the karma meter. I would have liked to be able to stay right in the middle,
like a grey moral area between good cowboy and bad cowboy but oh well.

The graphics are amazing, let's just get that out of the way. It looks great, the weather system is a little fast sometimes but not too jarring. The biomes that simulate the arid areas, the cold areas and the more temperate areas are superbly done. I especially hate the swamp lands cause it gives me that gross humid feeling and it is frankly pretty great since its able to make me feel that way.

Clothing options aplenty but with some limitations. Truly the endgame is to be able to dress up in many different outfits and be able to put on different looks whenever the mood strikes you. There's a decent amount of clothes you can layer but sometimes the physics kind of bug out. This part specifically for the online version cause the tail coats have a bug that give your character some ""extra cake"". 

There is a good selection of playable guns and I love the fact that you can customize them as well. Who wouldn't wanna ride off in the sunset with a pair of golden revolvers? Pearl handles too. [i]Fancy.[/i]

If the first few hours of the game don't hook you in, you might not enjoy the rest of the actual game. If you're struggling to make it past the first bit, I urge you to trudge along and at least give it a fair chance. It gets a lot more fun, trust me. 

Oh the free roaming is great. You can ignore the storyline completely so that you can just ride around RP-ing as a cowboy or whatever you wanna do. Standard rockstar open world but no cars, only horses.

The best part that I like about RDR2 is the hunting.
You can just chill out and instead of doing the usual thing where you shoot people,
you can just go hunting instead, stalk your prey, strike and skin 'em. Make 'em into clothes 'n stuff.

Go fishing, catch some good eats. Avoid getting bodied by a crocodile.

Just remember.

Be rootin'
be tootin'
and above all
[b]be shootin'[/b]


Also RDO is kinda [u]meh.[/u]
So many cheaters.


RDR2 = 9/10",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"A real living breathing world. One of if not the most immersive game worlds ever created, though it is a very slow game because its almost like being there in the old west for real. Some may like that, others may love the immersion.

It has some of the most realistic NPCs with actual AI that works, which seems rare for games of today. You can even talk to every NPC and there is a lot of interaction.

It also has, while small considering its the old west, the most immersive towns and ""cities"" (for the time period) ever created in a game. The towns are amazing, and never have I seen such amazing detail with so much interaction, realism and actual npcs that look like they belong there in towns/cities that know how to move out of your way than I have this game.

Definitely highly recommended if you are looking for a highly immersive, slow paced game, where you can actually feel like you are really living in the old west.",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Even though the game has been out for awhile, I held off on buying it as I was not interested at initial release.
I finally decided to take a real long look at the game, game play and reviews out there. Those pushed me over the edge and I now have RDR2 in my Library.

Let me start by saying the game still costs a premium price for as long as it has been out. That might scare some off who have tight budgets. However, for me, it is one of those games that is still worth the cost.

You are not going to finish this game quickly and feel like it cost #20.oo a day to finish a game in 3 days, something I have experienced too often.  This thing takes some time, and it is time well spent. 
The story is rich and engaging. I find the main character, Arthur Morgan, to be fascinating and entertaining as I play along. He draws you in to the game, a game rich in story.
Now the graphics, well, they are beautiful. With my RTX 3080 from Asus, I am running this game fulling Optimized through G-force Experience and still get over 100 fps at 1440p. 

Replay value on this game will be great too. I can see me playing it several times over, changing outcomes along the way by my actions just to see what happens. Now I don't feel bad about the price at all!

Looking for a game rich in story, long playing with great replay value, excellent graphics, entertaining as all get out? Here it is...................... you're welcome! :-)",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,THIS IS A GOOD LOOKING GAME,1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"First i have to start by saying that this game is a masterpiece. This is the first game i have taken 100 screenshots in the first 10 hours of the game. 
Playing as Arthur was the best thing in a game because he is one of the best protagonist i have played as.
The animations and the voice actors just fit so good one with each other. This is the first game in a long time that made me do every possible mission. The side quests are so well done. Some of them change some things in the story mode.

 Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel of the first Red Dead Redemption and it's a good this cause we finally saw what happened to the gang that John was in. And now a lot of things make more sense in the first one.
Red Dead Online it's a prequel of a prequel, it's really weird. Online it's not bad, but it's hard for new players to make the gold and money. And it needs some heists/robberies but other then that it's good.

The graphics and visuals of the game are astonishing and really well made.
The gameplay it's just so good like no other game.
The soundtrack just amazing and really well fitted. A really great choice with the western like vibe of the music and game.

I fell in love with the game in the first 2 hours of it because it's just so good.
 I played like 10-12 hours per day cause it's great. No game really made me do that.  That's how much i love it. I don't regret buying this game. I bought it on sale for 40 euros. The best decision. The game is worth every penny you have. I hope they will port Red Dead Redemption to pc so i can play it or maybe a remake or remastered version of it and maybe Undead Nightmare 1&2.
So if you have the money buy the game it's worth it.
If you want to look at the screenshots that i have, some are spoilers so be carefull.",1174180

19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"So, RDR2 consists of two modes, Story and Online.

[b]Story[/b] - is simply incredible. Not only it features a solid and really dramatic plotline, the amount of details in this game is beyond any comparison. From your first hours in this game you will literally FEEL much love and dedication devs have put in it. Lots of stuff to do, explore and complete. It's interesting, it's enjoyable, its fun. Overall - really deep and really entertaining, very much recommending it, worth it's full price without any doubt.

[b]Online[/b] - well, now it becames problematic. It's simply too shallow comparing to singleplayer. In general your gameplay in RDO consists of two things - missions and competitive sessions like deathmatch or races. Even so caled ""roles"" are basically sets of different missions, some of them are nice and interesting, most of them are your typical fetch-kill quests. RDO also has story missions, they are kinda okay, but nothing special either. What's really bad about RDO - its people, who are playing it, since in 90% of player interactions you will be one-shot instantly from a sniper rifle long before you actually see who did this. Which in turn forces even the peaceful players to behave the same and kill first to avoid being killed. Game is full of griefers and cheaters, Rockstar doesn't give a single about them, as they never did in GTA:O. Thus the same ""pull the plug"" countermeasures which worked in GTA:O are working (and recommended) here too. It's also filled with minor, but extremely annoying bugs, the game is really unstable at times. In general - it's playable, sometimes enjoyable but lacks any memorable moments apart from really toxic ones which you won't be really happy to remember at all.

Thus, as friendly advice - don't buy standalone RDO, just buy this full version for it's Story mode in mind and you'll be good.",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"I first played this game on Xbox 4-5 months ago, and I can honestly say that this is the best game that I've ever played, and probably always will be. I never thought that I'd love a game this much, it's absolutely amazing! I'm not just talking about the story here, the graphics, the music, the details, the world itself...but man, the story ""CHEFFS KISS"". You can tell that this game was made with love, and passion, by overworked RockStar employees (no sarcasm intended). I never thought a game like this could exsist. You might think that I'm exaggerating, but damn it, I'm not! I cried for 2 hours when I finished this game (not the epilogue part, tho that made me cry too). Then I tried explaining why I cried so much to my parents, and I teared up again. I was depressed and empty for 2 fucking weeks, this game wrecked me! OK, so basically this game made soft, but damn it, it's worth it. The side characters, every litte story, every main mission, every detail, John Marston, and esspecially the one and only ARTHUR MORGAN were absolutely amazing! 
I never got attached to a character like this. He became one of my all time favorite fictional characters ever. 
I know that the price is a little bit high, but it's worth every penny of it. Definitely buy this game, and not watch story walkthroughs, cuz it's a whole other experience when you play it yourself. I can talk about this game for hours and hours, but I'm not gonna. So just buy the fricking game, and enjoy it.",1174180

honestly one of the best stories ive seen in a game, an amazing experience.

red dead online, however, is more or less a grindy cash grab.",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,yes,1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"This is the perfect story game.

I regret rushing through it like i did, completing the main story in 39 hours. There is so much to explore and do which could lead to 100+ hours of gameplay. Even so, the 39 hours that I did get through felt magical. This game is a living and breathing environment. Nothing felt cookie-cutter about the world. Everywhere I went felt new and fresh to the place I went last. 

The Van Der Linde gang members feel all unique, with all different personalities. I formed intricate attachments to each of them, which makes their fate feel all the more special, or tragic. Every cool thing they did felt great, and every sad moment felt heartbreaking. The Villains as well were perfectly made too. Every character you were meant to like, i liked, and every character you were meant to hate, i hated. That is perfect character development.

The soundtrack for this game is unreal also, really immersed me into the game. Normally in games i turn off the music, but i kept the RDR2 soundtrack on. Don't regret it one bit.

Even though I'm finished with the main story, and soon the Epilogue, this will no doubt not be the only time i play through the story. Some changes I'll make is that I'll explore more, its easy to get wrapped up in the story and I missed out on so many cool things to do. 

Rockstar outdid themselves with this game. Luckily I bought this on sale, but I would pay the £55 HAPPILY. After 2 years, the pricetag may be off-putting to some people, but they will not regret it. If Rockstar ever do a RDR3, they should double down on the prequel stuff, and go right back to 1865 where the Wild West is dawning and rampant characters are fighting for supremacy, would make for an awesome prequel to the prequel.

I cannot fault this game, aside from the Rockstar Launcher being trash, 10/10

I can see how one influences another, but the story mode isn't harmed so Online can exist, you’re not going to be harassed by any micro transactions while on singleplayer. The Online is just a choice by definition, you even have the option to turn off friend’s invites. There will be no propaganda of other games in the menu either, like Ubisoft and Capcom usually do. There is no immersion breaking items demanding you to PRETEND they aren't there.

I was afraid of buying this because I was skeptical that a game could be better than RDR1 with John Marston. I also avoided it due the highly inflated price in my country (bolsonaro vai tomar no cú). The current sellout discount this month was my best chance. This game is a perfected RDR1 if such witchery is even possible.

If you’re not an immersive gamer, you’ll learn to be. There are a lot of gameplay mechanics to suit every gamer but they’re so intuitive and sophisticated, it tends to incentivize you to adjust to a survival hybrid. You can be the good-bad guy (the canon R* expects from you), be a chill Boomhauer or just be the bad-bad guy. Sneak, bomb, kill, hunt, whatever you wish or if chaos suits you, even the smallest of things got a lot to show as you have probably heard already.

Now while the Online game preserves some of it, surely isn't the same direction. You can fully customize a character but he/she lacks voice for logical reasons, thus no substance (it has story progression) but things are much less dense & less interesting for me. Not my thing to wait for unpredictable randoms, but fun-guarantee with known friends. Again, it is a different driving force in there that requires a mood I don't always have.

When it comes to feelings however, assuming you were convinced to accept the story's pace, you'll have time to feel incredible moments and to see beautiful places, especially with decent graphics.

19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"[h1]ROOTY TOOTY COWBOY SHOOTY YEEHAW SIMULATOR[/h1]

There are enough reviews out there that tell you that this game is a [b]very good game.[/b]

The usual points being that the game is a slow burn.
That's true because it [b]is.[/b]

But it is made to be that way so that you have time to slowly get to know the characters that are introduced to you. Slowly you begin to form your own biases and conclusions for each character as Arthur interacts with them.

You make decisions that will impact how everyone sees you and how everyone will treat you. Though I would have wanted to explore that a bit more, your decisions are gonna be influenced by the karma meter. I would have liked to be able to stay right in the middle,
like a grey moral area between good cowboy and bad cowboy but oh well.

The graphics are amazing, let's just get that out of the way. It looks great, the weather system is a little fast sometimes but not too jarring. The biomes that simulate the arid areas, the cold areas and the more temperate areas are superbly done. I especially hate the swamp lands cause it gives me that gross humid feeling and it is frankly pretty great since its able to make me feel that way.

Clothing options aplenty but with some limitations. Truly the endgame is to be able to dress up in many different outfits and be able to put on different looks whenever the mood strikes you. There's a decent amount of clothes you can layer but sometimes the physics kind of bug out. This part specifically for the online version cause the tail coats have a bug that give your character some ""extra cake"". 

There is a good selection of playable guns and I love the fact that you can customize them as well. Who wouldn't wanna ride off in the sunset with a pair of golden revolvers? Pearl handles too. [i]Fancy.[/i]

If the first few hours of the game don't hook you in, you might not enjoy the rest of the actual game. If you're struggling to make it past the first bit, I urge you to trudge along and at least give it a fair chance. It gets a lot more fun, trust me. 

Oh the free roaming is great. You can ignore the storyline completely so that you can just ride around RP-ing as a cowboy or whatever you wanna do. Standard rockstar open world but no cars, only horses.

The best part that I like about RDR2 is the hunting.
You can just chill out and instead of doing the usual thing where you shoot people,
you can just go hunting instead, stalk your prey, strike and skin 'em. Make 'em into clothes 'n stuff.

Go fishing, catch some good eats. Avoid getting bodied by a crocodile.

Just remember.

Be rootin'
be tootin'
and above all
[b]be shootin'[/b]


Also RDO is kinda [u]meh.[/u]
So many cheaters.


RDR2 = 9/10",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"A real living breathing world. One of if not the most immersive game worlds ever created, though it is a very slow game because its almost like being there in the old west for real. Some may like that, others may love the immersion.

It has some of the most realistic NPCs with actual AI that works, which seems rare for games of today. You can even talk to every NPC and there is a lot of interaction.

It also has, while small considering its the old west, the most immersive towns and ""cities"" (for the time period) ever created in a game. The towns are amazing, and never have I seen such amazing detail with so much interaction, realism and actual npcs that look like they belong there in towns/cities that know how to move out of your way than I have this game.

Definitely highly recommended if you are looking for a highly immersive, slow paced game, where you can actually feel like you are really living in the old west.",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Even though the game has been out for awhile, I held off on buying it as I was not interested at initial release.
I finally decided to take a real long look at the game, game play and reviews out there. Those pushed me over the edge and I now have RDR2 in my Library.

Let me start by saying the game still costs a premium price for as long as it has been out. That might scare some off who have tight budgets. However, for me, it is one of those games that is still worth the cost.

You are not going to finish this game quickly and feel like it cost #20.oo a day to finish a game in 3 days, something I have experienced too often.  This thing takes some time, and it is time well spent. 
The story is rich and engaging. I find the main character, Arthur Morgan, to be fascinating and entertaining as I play along. He draws you in to the game, a game rich in story.
Now the graphics, well, they are beautiful. With my RTX 3080 from Asus, I am running this game fulling Optimized through G-force Experience and still get over 100 fps at 1440p. 

Replay value on this game will be great too. I can see me playing it several times over, changing outcomes along the way by my actions just to see what happens. Now I don't feel bad about the price at all!

Looking for a game rich in story, long playing with great replay value, excellent graphics, entertaining as all get out? Here it is...................... you're welcome! :-)",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,THIS IS A GOOD LOOKING GAME,1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"First i have to start by saying that this game is a masterpiece. This is the first game i have taken 100 screenshots in the first 10 hours of the game. 
Playing as Arthur was the best thing in a game because he is one of the best protagonist i have played as.
The animations and the voice actors just fit so good one with each other. This is the first game in a long time that made me do every possible mission. The side quests are so well done. Some of them change some things in the story mode.

 Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel of the first Red Dead Redemption and it's a good this cause we finally saw what happened to the gang that John was in. And now a lot of things make more sense in the first one.
Red Dead Online it's a prequel of a prequel, it's really weird. Online it's not bad, but it's hard for new players to make the gold and money. And it needs some heists/robberies but other then that it's good.

The graphics and visuals of the game are astonishing and really well made.
The gameplay it's just so good like no other game.
The soundtrack just amazing and really well fitted. A really great choice with the western like vibe of the music and game.

I fell in love with the game in the first 2 hours of it because it's just so good.
 I played like 10-12 hours per day cause it's great. No game really made me do that.  That's how much i love it. I don't regret buying this game. I bought it on sale for 40 euros. The best decision. The game is worth every penny you have. I hope they will port Red Dead Redemption to pc so i can play it or maybe a remake or remastered version of it and maybe Undead Nightmare 1&2.
So if you have the money buy the game it's worth it.
If you want to look at the screenshots that i have, some are spoilers so be carefull.",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,long and nice story,1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"Thumbs up, but sucks that the game only offers perks to morally good choices. I want to be evil.",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"happy but sad, can't explain my pain",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"So, RDR2 consists of two modes, Story and Online.

[b]Story[/b] - is simply incredible. Not only it features a solid and really dramatic plotline, the amount of details in this game is beyond any comparison. From your first hours in this game you will literally FEEL much love and dedication devs have put in it. Lots of stuff to do, explore and complete. It's interesting, it's enjoyable, its fun. Overall - really deep and really entertaining, very much recommending it, worth it's full price without any doubt.

[b]Online[/b] - well, now it becames problematic. It's simply too shallow comparing to singleplayer. In general your gameplay in RDO consists of two things - missions and competitive sessions like deathmatch or races. Even so caled ""roles"" are basically sets of different missions, some of them are nice and interesting, most of them are your typical fetch-kill quests. RDO also has story missions, they are kinda okay, but nothing special either. What's really bad about RDO - its people, who are playing it, since in 90% of player interactions you will be one-shot instantly from a sniper rifle long before you actually see who did this. Which in turn forces even the peaceful players to behave the same and kill first to avoid being killed. Game is full of griefers and cheaters, Rockstar doesn't give a single about them, as they never did in GTA:O. Thus the same ""pull the plug"" countermeasures which worked in GTA:O are working (and recommended) here too. It's also filled with minor, but extremely annoying bugs, the game is really unstable at times. In general - it's playable, sometimes enjoyable but lacks any memorable moments apart from really toxic ones which you won't be really happy to remember at all.

Thus, as friendly advice - don't buy standalone RDO, just buy this full version for it's Story mode in mind and you'll be good.",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"I first played this game on Xbox 4-5 months ago, and I can honestly say that this is the best game that I've ever played, and probably always will be. I never thought that I'd love a game this much, it's absolutely amazing! I'm not just talking about the story here, the graphics, the music, the details, the world itself...but man, the story ""CHEFFS KISS"". You can tell that this game was made with love, and passion, by overworked RockStar employees (no sarcasm intended). I never thought a game like this could exsist. You might think that I'm exaggerating, but damn it, I'm not! I cried for 2 hours when I finished this game (not the epilogue part, tho that made me cry too). Then I tried explaining why I cried so much to my parents, and I teared up again. I was depressed and empty for 2 fucking weeks, this game wrecked me! OK, so basically this game made soft, but damn it, it's worth it. The side characters, every litte story, every main mission, every detail, John Marston, and esspecially the one and only ARTHUR MORGAN were absolutely amazing! 
I never got attached to a character like this. He became one of my all time favorite fictional characters ever. 
I know that the price is a little bit high, but it's worth every penny of it. Definitely buy this game, and not watch story walkthroughs, cuz it's a whole other experience when you play it yourself. I can talk about this game for hours and hours, but I'm not gonna. So just buy the fricking game, and enjoy it.",1174180

19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"basically yee-haw GTA V, instead of helicopters and rocket launchers you have horses and cool revolvers.",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"mainly played on the playstation.
honestly one of the best stories ive seen in a game, an amazing experience.

red dead online, however, is more or less a grindy cash grab.",1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,yes,1174180
19,Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"This is the perfect story game.

I regret rushing through it like i did, completing the main story in 39 hours. There is so much to explore and do which could lead to 100+ hours of gameplay. Even so, the 39 hours that I did get through felt magical. This game is a living and breathing environment. Nothing felt cookie-cutter about the world. Everywhere I went felt new and fresh to the place I went last. 

The Van Der Linde gang members feel all unique, with all different personalities. I formed intricate attachments to each of them, which makes their fate feel all the more special, or tragic. Every cool thing they did felt great, and every sad moment felt heartbreaking. The Villains as well were perfectly made too. Every character you were meant to like, i liked, and every character you were meant to hate, i hated. That is perfect character development.

The soundtrack for this game is unreal also, really immersed me into the game. Normally in games i turn off the music, but i kept the RDR2 soundtrack on. Don't regret it one bit.

Even though I'm finished with the main story, and soon the Epilogue, this will no doubt not be the only time i play through the story. Some changes I'll make is that I'll explore more, its easy to get wrapped up in the story and I missed out on so many cool things to do. 

Rockstar outdid themselves with this game. Luckily I bought this on sale, but I would pay the £55 HAPPILY. After 2 years, the pricetag may be off-putting to some people, but they will not regret it. If Rockstar ever do a RDR3, they should double down on the prequel stuff, and go right back to 1865 where the Wild West is dawning and rampant characters are fighting for supremacy, would make for an awesome prequel to the prequel.

I cannot fault this game, aside from the Rockstar Launcher being trash, 10/10

21,Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"You wake in a tavern, replenish your ship's supplies (food, wood, cannon balls) and customize it's cosmetics.
You talk with an NPC who gives you a quest. You receive a map of an island with red crosses on it.
You go to your ship and search for that island on the world map. You find it, and figure out which way to sail.
You unfurl your sails and turn the helm towards the destination.

A few minutes pass. While you're in the middle of the ocean, trying to navigate around a storm, the water suddenly turns black. Combat music kicks in, as a pair of tentacles emerge from the depths.
A wild Kraken appears, and it thinks that your ship is tasty.
You grab a handful of cannonballs from storage and man the cannons.
With a few well placed shots and a couple shredded tentacles, the Kraken leaves you alone.
You repair the damage to your ship, and jump in the water to pick up the Kraken's meat.
Looking at the map, a short detour towards a trading post is possible.
You place the meat on a skillet to cook, while you turn your ship towards the merchants.
After selling the Kraken meat, you set sail towards your quest.
The rest of the voyage is uneventful, and you reach the island and drop the anchor.
With map in one hand and a shovel in another, you set foot on the tropical island before you.
With no minimap, you need to read the map and orient yourself based on landmarks you see.
Eventually you find one of the places where the treasure should be.
Enthusiastically, you swing your shovel in to the sand and hit wood!

You've found a wooden chest, that is one of the treasures on the island.
However, you also found a pack of animated skeletons who would rather you not take the treasure.
You draw your sword and fight the bones.
You notice a lone skeleton carry a big red barrel of gunpowder toward you. Without skipping a beat, you run a few paces away and draw your pistol.
With a single shot, you hit the barrel which promptly explodes, obliterating the nearby skeletons.
One of which drops a piece of parchment.
On the parchment there is a quest...

Sea of Thieves is a well polished multiplayer-only title about adventure. There's plenty of stuff to do, and the game always finds more activities to offer you.
The only downside is that it requires a crew to be viable in PVP (which can't be turned off), and to be effective the crew needs to communicate well. It can be hard to find such crew, so it's best played with friends you know in advance.",1172620

21,Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"I am really unsure whether I should recommend this game or not. 

Pro:
-Awesome piratey atmosphere
-Sailing is a lot of fun, especially with friends, but also single
-Cool stories and exploration is fun

Con:
-Toxic Community
-You're killed on sight, no matter if you have loot, are friendly or mind your own business, then made fun of
-There are no PVE servers, not even safezones
-No Roleplay except with your friends

Me and my friends lost interest in this game fairly quickly. We wanted to enjoy the game, not constantly participate in some waterbased pvp-arena, in which one is forced to compete because of nonexisting pve-guidelines, therefore the perfect hunting grounds for toxic-pvp players. While merely learning the basics, we have been killed countless times and had to learn many things from youtube, because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to play the game at all. 

@developers: I understand, that it's an important aspect in a pirate game to be able to freely murder and pillage, but why are there no safezones, at least where the traders are (almost every multiplayerbased game with pvp-elements has those or npc-guarded zones)? Please reconsider including more pve-friendly mechanics, maybe a pirates codex with rules, which are not optional to a certain degree or maybe an npc-based menace like the royal navy, where playergroups can join in a pirate alliance to take on npc-vessels. The game has a lot of potencial, sadly not so much for atmosphere-loving pve players. For now I therefore give this game no recommendation, because in the current state im not motivated to play it any further.",1172620

21,Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"This can be a fun game if you're into PvP and exploring.   The game is beautiful and you can have fun by yourself, however there is some bad stuff.

Bad Stuff - This is stuff that has happened to me more than once, so buyer beware:
You can easily end getting chased for an hour by a toxic group shouting obscenities that just wants to sink you and then hunt you down again and again which really can take the fun out of the game.  If you run a large boat by yourself a group of 2-3 people can join you, put you in the brig and sink your ship out of nowhere.  I've also had players who joined just randomly start throwing treasure you've gathered off the side of the boat while at full sail or try to burn down your ship by cooking a banana.  

The late game is difficult due to 3 hours spent grinding quests to get a chest for little to no reputation.  And if you're running the faction's flag (which gets you more reputation for turning in faction's treasure), players will attempt to hide on your boat to steal it from you.  I also found out that there is a PC cheat that does aimbot and can find ships / loot within a distance that you can't see normally. So a few of those times where a ship came out of nowhere at the end of my run when I had a lot of loot and sank me, I felt it might have happened due to that cheat.

But all in all I had a lot of fun playing the game.  I occasionally met some good chill players to hang out with.  I enjoyed exploring, puzzle solving and the PvE but I could really do without the PvP toxicity and griefing.",1172620

2. As this game Is expensive coming about 40eur Just think about different game that you wanted or other stuff.

3. And If you do decide purchase Sea Of Thieves then Myb wait some time until It goes on sale or If there's summer sale close then just wait till summer sale starts.

21,Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"It's an ok game. I played it on the xbox pass for a while with friends and I honestly can't say it's a game I'd play without at least one friend. The gameplay loop is very shallow and the PvE content is a bit bare bones (pun intended.) Basically PvE you run to location, figure out a basic riddle, then dig for treasure. You can then sell this treasure for some in-game cosmetics and congrats you've done the entire PvE loop. There are also some little ""raid""-like islands full of skeletons but the rewards just don't feel like they're worth it.
The community is full of toxic children, so be prepared to be called the r, f, n, and other various words I can't repeat on Steam a lot. You know how the ""Call of Duty"" experience is to have little kids say they slept with your mom and you need to get good? Yeah it's basically that.
PvP is fine, I suppose. The combat is pretty bare-bones that I really don't see myself soloing in this game at all, if ever. 
In the end I can't really recommend this game simply because the combat is shallow and a boring, and that's what you'll be doing half the time. The other half is sailing around, which they did do quite nicely. If you have a group of friends to mess around with, go for it. Otherwise as a solo player I'd give this a pass.",1172620

21,Sea of Thieves,Adventure,1172620,"It's an ok game. I played it on the xbox pass for a while with friends and I honestly can't say it's a game I'd play without at least one friend. The gameplay loop is very shallow and the PvE content is a bit bare bones (pun intended.) Basically PvE you run to location, figure out a basic riddle, then dig for treasure. You can then sell this treasure for some in-game cosmetics and congrats you've done the entire PvE loop. There are also some little ""raid""-like islands full of skeletons but the rewards just don't feel like they're worth it.
The community is full of toxic children, so be prepared to be called the r, f, n, and other various words I can't repeat on Steam a lot. You know how the ""Call of Duty"" experience is to have little kids say they slept with your mom and you need to get good? Yeah it's basically that.
PvP is fine, I suppose. The combat is pretty bare-bones that I really don't see myself soloing in this game at all, if ever. 
In the end I can't really recommend this game simply because the combat is shallow and a boring, and that's what you'll be doing half the time. The other half is sailing around, which they did do quite nicely. If you have a group of friends to mess around with, go for it. Otherwise as a solo player I'd give this a pass.",1172620

25,Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"[h1] Pros : [/h1]
(All the good stuff from the 2013 game is still here so i'm just going to copy the pros from my review of that game.)
+ Movements and controls are very fluid
+ Great combat system (you can play it stealthy but some missions forces you to go full on rambo mode)
+ A lot of ugradable skills and weapons
+ Parkour is great and fun
+ Puzzles are challenging
+ Open world with many things to explore and wander around
+ Great graphics and well optimized
+ Epic music that tells you sh*t's about to get down

[h1] Extra pros : [/h1]
+ Very fun fast-crafting mechanic for stealth and loud
+ A lot more variety of weapons to use
+ Better costumes
+ Story's not bad

[h1] Cons : [/h1]
- I've had some glitches here and there but it's not that bad
- Sometimes the assets doesn't load. (objectives, guards, etc.)
- Movements sometimes a bit glitchy and hard to control. (ledge jumping, etc.)

[b] Overall it's an amazing game with all the pros from its predecessor and some glitches.
Best adventure game i've played. [/b]
[h1] 10/10. [/h1]",391220
25,Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,damn the graphics..,391220
25,Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"First of all I have to say, Although it has been about 5 years since the production of this game, but we can still say with confidence that it is ahead of many new production games. 

Everything in this game is gathered like adventure - excitement. Thinking . Story and .... . 

 I emphasize again if you have not experienced this game for any reason. Do not hesitate and buy this game now.

Finally, I will mention some positive features of this game:

1- Lara croft's unique and lively design.
2- Beautiful artistic designs.
3- Attractive construction and upgrade system.
4- Appropriate story and characterization.
5- A glamorous world.
6- Return of temples and puzzles to their roots.
7- Low defect concealment system.
8- Very good artistic and technical graphics.

This game has definitely been one of my best purchases. I told you everything you needed to know. But the final decision is with you ....",391220
25,Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"I love this game so much.
So many improvements from the last game, and many fun activities and quests added.",391220
25,Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"The Rise of the Tomb Raider serves as the sequel to the 2013 Tomb Raider remake, following events of Lara Croft's first expedition to Yamatai. While the second game does not necessarily need the first to understand the events and story that unfold, having played the first game provides a better understanding of Lara's character development and some references brought up from the first game from time to time.

The most appealing aspects and strong points of Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider series remake is its cinematic graphics, the details on Lara Croft's design (with this game displaying an even better definition than the first game), and the breathtaking landscapes creating the world in Lara's journeys. New features are also introduced to make the gameplay more interesting and interactive when solving challenges and surviving brutal terrains in accomplishing optional objectives or progressing with the story. The story itself is typical for a thrilling escapade to hidden worlds waiting to be discovered, one fit for a Lara Croft adventure.

The Rise of the Tomb Raider also includes the ""Croft Manor: Blood Ties"", which is a great addition to the game that gives more depth to Lara, her family history, and her background. It gives a sense of people from Lara's past you never knew, some of who you never even see, but from whom you can feel emotion in relaying experiences, thoughts, and events, to create a history all leading to Lara's destiny.

25,Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"[h1] Pros : [/h1]
(All the good stuff from the 2013 game is still here so i'm just going to copy the pros from my review of that game.)
+ Movements and controls are very fluid
+ Great combat system (you can play it stealthy but some missions forces you to go full on rambo mode)
+ A lot of ugradable skills and weapons
+ Parkour is great and fun
+ Puzzles are challenging
+ Open world with many things to explore and wander around
+ Great graphics and well optimized
+ Epic music that tells you sh*t's about to get down

[h1] Extra pros : [/h1]
+ Very fun fast-crafting mechanic for stealth and loud
+ A lot more variety of weapons to use
+ Better costumes
+ Story's not bad

[h1] Cons : [/h1]
- I've had some glitches here and there but it's not that bad
- Sometimes the assets doesn't load. (objectives, guards, etc.)
- Movements sometimes a bit glitchy and hard to control. (ledge jumping, etc.)

[b] Overall it's an amazing game with all the pros from its predecessor and some glitches.
Best adventure game i've played. [/b]
[h1] 10/10. [/h1]",391220
25,Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,damn the graphics..,391220
25,Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"First of all I have to say, Although it has been about 5 years since the production of this game, but we can still say with confidence that it is ahead of many new production games. 

Everything in this game is gathered like adventure - excitement. Thinking . Story and .... . 

 I emphasize again if you have not experienced this game for any reason. Do not hesitate and buy this game now.

Finally, I will mention some positive features of this game:

1- Lara croft's unique and lively design.
2- Beautiful artistic designs.
3- Attractive construction and upgrade system.
4- Appropriate story and characterization.
5- A glamorous world.
6- Return of temples and puzzles to their roots.
7- Low defect concealment system.
8- Very good artistic and technical graphics.

This game has definitely been one of my best purchases. I told you everything you needed to know. But the final decision is with you ....",391220
25,Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"I love this game so much.
So many improvements from the last game, and many fun activities and quests added.",391220
25,Rise of the Tomb Raider™,Adventure,391220,"The Rise of the Tomb Raider serves as the sequel to the 2013 Tomb Raider remake, following events of Lara Croft's first expedition to Yamatai. While the second game does not necessarily need the first to understand the events and story that unfold, having played the first game provides a better understanding of Lara's character development and some references brought up from the first game from time to time.

The most appealing aspects and strong points of Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider series remake is its cinematic graphics, the details on Lara Croft's design (with this game displaying an even better definition than the first game), and the breathtaking landscapes creating the world in Lara's journeys. New features are also introduced to make the gameplay more interesting and interactive when solving challenges and surviving brutal terrains in accomplishing optional objectives or progressing with the story. The story itself is typical for a thrilling escapade to hidden worlds waiting to be discovered, one fit for a Lara Croft adventure.

The Rise of the Tomb Raider also includes the ""Croft Manor: Blood Ties"", which is a great addition to the game that gives more depth to Lara, her family history, and her background. It gives a sense of people from Lara's past you never knew, some of who you never even see, but from whom you can feel emotion in relaying experiences, thoughts, and events, to create a history all leading to Lara's destiny.

26,Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,A turkey jumped on my head.,546560
26,Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"Half-Life Alyx easily makes up for the 15+ years of waiting for Half-Life 3. I can only hope HL3 is this good. I highly recommend playing this on the Valve Index, as it is truly worth the price.

Graphics:
-Insane. I played on ultra fidelity at high refresh rate since my PC can handle it. There is a substantial difference between good graphics on a monitor VS in VR. I'm not quite sure how they accomplished it, as most areas look insanely real. Lighting with a flashlight or laser acts in the way my brain would expect it to, and the amount of detail on simple things such as a notification posted on a wall made me want to constantly stop and look around the environment. The environments alone make this game worth playing, and are a technological marvel.

Combat:
-Unlike anything I've ever played. Using iron sights on weapons requires you to use one eye, just as you would in real life. Manually having to eject a handgun magazine, grab a new one from your backpack, slam it into the gun, then chamber a round is incredibly fun and satisfying. Reloading in itself is a task that requires mastering, and never gets old. This creates a lot of tense moments of fun, such as being grabbed by a barnacle, only to realize you had two bullets left in the magazine and now need to panic reload. I dropped multiple magazines of ammo trying to panic reload in combat, and this only adds to the realism and tension. The shotgun is similar; having to manually chamber shells, then slam the bolt to load. Never gets old. Also, throwing grenades feels extremely intuitive and natural (IF USING THE VALVE INDEX), and objects throw in the way I'd expect them to. If you have a larger play space, you can physically move around to duck behind cover,  walk through doors with your gun ready, shoot around corners, dodge projectiles, etc.

Puzzles:
-Clever use of interaction and physics makes puzzles really interesting and fun in a way that you haven't encountered in other games. Defusing bombs for example is essentially a minigame of trying to carefully thread a needle through small rings without touching them, while being on a timer. Your success is purely based upon your dexterity, and if you fail it all blows up in your face (literally).

Audio:
-I played using the Valve Index, which has the built-in headphones that float near your ears. These provided the most realistic environmental sound I've ever experienced in a game. I'm not sure how Valve even accomplished this. There is excellent kick and bass to guns and things in the environment. At one point I took my VR headset off because I thought an actual bee was in my apartment, but it was the game.

Story:
-I don't want to spoil anything, but the story was FAR better than I thought it would be, and adds A LOT of intriguing questions to the series. There are some extremely key moments in the game that make you stop and be like O_O


TLDR:
-Half-Life Alyx is a technological marvel, and easily makes up for the 15+ year wait for Half-Life 3. I can only hope Half-Life 3 is this good. Far and away one of the most incredible experiences in gaming I've ever had. I 100% recommend buying a Valve Index to play this, since the game was designed specifically for it. Being able to fully open your hand to throw objects or sift through a box of supplies is FAR more immersive, and the built-in audio system of the Index is phenomenal. Even without it though, you will enjoy this.",546560

Update 6.18.21: Hungry,  going back in, must eat Snark...",546560
26,Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"I don't even know where to begin... as a long-time gamer and Half Life fan, and early adopter of VR (and all its shortcomings), I didn't understand the hype around this game.  I mean... a Half Life game that wasn't a shooter?  How would you get around the semi-stationary limitations of VR?  Would this be jumping from room to room, shooting at targets that pop out, then moving to the next stationary point?  How cool could that really be?

Well... let me assure you, this game is somehow better than all the (absurd amount of) hype, combined.  This is not only a showcase of what VR can be TODAY, but an incredible honor to the Half-Life franchise.  It's simply put, amazing.  The incredible detail and immersion of environments in this game, the puzzles incorporated throughout, and the semi RPG elements (customization of weapons), along with the scarcity of ammo and thus danger of encounters, makes for an amazingly tense game... and one in which I've spent far too long just looking around in awe.

This is currently THE game to try, hands down.  For the record, I'm 11 hours in and still not done - so this isn't the usual 1-2 hours of VR gameplay for $40-60.  Try it, be amazed, and get ready for what this spurs the VR industry to make next! :)

-I don't want to spoil anything, but the story was FAR better than I thought it would be, and adds A LOT of intriguing questions to the series. There are some extremely key moments in the game that make you stop and be like O_O


TLDR:
-Half-Life Alyx is a technological marvel, and easily makes up for the 15+ year wait for Half-Life 3. I can only hope Half-Life 3 is this good. Far and away one of the most incredible experiences in gaming I've ever had. I 100% recommend buying a Valve Index to play this, since the game was designed specifically for it. Being able to fully open your hand to throw objects or sift through a box of supplies is FAR more immersive, and the built-in audio system of the Index is phenomenal. Even without it though, you will enjoy this.",546560

suspense and lower grade battles to warm you up for dealing with Jeff on crack LOL.

No spoilers guys, I would highly recommend this if you are suited for single player / survival genre VR.

Update 6.18.21: Hungry,  going back in, must eat Snark...",546560
26,Half-Life: Alyx,Adventure,546560,"I don't even know where to begin... as a long-time gamer and Half Life fan, and early adopter of VR (and all its shortcomings), I didn't understand the hype around this game.  I mean... a Half Life game that wasn't a shooter?  How would you get around the semi-stationary limitations of VR?  Would this be jumping from room to room, shooting at targets that pop out, then moving to the next stationary point?  How cool could that really be?

Well... let me assure you, this game is somehow better than all the (absurd amount of) hype, combined.  This is not only a showcase of what VR can be TODAY, but an incredible honor to the Half-Life franchise.  It's simply put, amazing.  The incredible detail and immersion of environments in this game, the puzzles incorporated throughout, and the semi RPG elements (customization of weapons), along with the scarcity of ammo and thus danger of encounters, makes for an amazingly tense game... and one in which I've spent far too long just looking around in awe.

This is currently THE game to try, hands down.  For the record, I'm 11 hours in and still not done - so this isn't the usual 1-2 hours of VR gameplay for $40-60.  Try it, be amazed, and get ready for what this spurs the VR industry to make next! :)

28,Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,I was expecting not to like this series becoming a jrpg but boy was I wrong,1235140
28,Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,"I held off on getting this game for a while, I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy the turn based combat instead of the traditional beat em up. I'm glad I bought this game and I wish I had sooner. This has become my favorite of the franchise and one of the best games I've ever played. The story is incredible and filled with brilliantly written and acted characters. 

The protagonist, Ichiban, has quite the boots to fill now that we're not playing as Kiryu anymore. Ichiban is an amazing protagonist and without question does Kiryu justice. The emotional range is wider, and the positive outlook on everything that Ichiban invigorates sets him apart from Kiryu. They're both masterpieces of character development, writing and acting. 

The gameplay is incredibly fun and addicting. Leveling up your character as well as the Job you have set at any given time. Jobs are essentially specializations that incorporate different roles like healing, magic/melee, or even tanking. There's tons of loot, materials for crafting gear, and an enormous variety of enemy designs. Since the game has taken this turn into JRPG territory it's allowed more traditional aspects of other RPGs. There's dungeons, tons of bosses and minibosses, an endgame activity that's very difficult, and more. There's well over 100 hours worth of content here and it all improves you and your party's abilities. 

My complaints are negligible, there's sometimes too many enemies on the streets. That's pretty much it, Yakuza Like A Dragon is near perfect and a must play for anyone who's played the previous games and for anyone who wants to jump for the first time into this universe. Playing the previous games isn't necessary.",1235140
28,Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,Unironically one of the best games i've played so far,1235140
28,Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,"Right, where do I start...

Yakuza: Like a Dragon (later in this review Yakuza 7) has been my introduction to the Yakuza franchise as a whole. Prior to this, all I knew about was the Bakamitai meme, which I also only knew as the Dame Da Ne song. I was a bit sceptical about getting into it at first, as I knew absolutely nothing about the game and franchise as a whole, and Brawlers weren't really my thing, but then I heard that this game features a different protagonist, and instead of a Brawler, plays as a turn based RPG. I had some money left over from Christmas, and I'm a big fan of the old Final Fantasy games, so I thought I might as well give it a try. Could always refund it if I didn't enjoy it. 

In Yakuza 7, you play as Ichiban Kasuga, a Yakuza grunt who goes to jail to cover for a higher-ranking member of the Arakawa family, which he belongs to. Thinking that this would make him climb the Yakuza ladder, and that his patriarch will honour and appreciate his cover, he comes back after 18 years of prison time to find out that everybody had abandoned him. Former police officer Koichi Adachi researched about the Tojo Clan and the Arakawa Family, attempts to convince Ichiban to come with him to Yokohama to stay safe, but Ichiban refuses. Ichiban finds his way back to his former patriarch and is then met with an unfortunate fate.

Oh boy, I was immediately hooked from the start. ""That's a lot of cutscenes for a game, it's like I'm watching a movie"" was my first thought. I liked story heavy games, but I felt a little overwhelmed on my first day, as out of the probably 5 or 6 hours that I was playing, 4 of them were just watching cutscenes. Now this might turn some people down, especially if they just want to enjoy the gameplay, but all the introductory scenes got me more invested in finding out about the presented characters and I didn't just want to stop playing until I found a point where I thought ""Okay, now the actual game finally begins.""

The vast majority of this game takes plays in the streets of Yokohama, more specifically, Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama's red light district. The world is incredibly detailed and you'll be pleasantly surprised to know that there's things hidden in every single corner. I really enjoy exploring in video games, trying to see if there's things hidden in places nobody would think of and-- to my surprise, they really thought of everything here. I try sneaking into a corner that I think might not even be intended to go to, and yet, there's something there for me to pick up. 

I personally went for the ""50% main story, 50% side story"" approach, which to me means - I'll do 2 or 3 side quests, of which there are plenty in Yakuza 7, and then I'll do a few story quests so that I can keep up with what is happening. And trust me, there's a lot of content to burn through. All of the sidequests are very well designed, and most of them got at least a little bit of a chuckle from me, so I'd like to think that they are quite humorous. Once done with the sidequests, I grabbed my imaginary bucket of popcorn and started getting immersed in the story. 

After I arrived in Yokohama, and the game properly begun for me, I thought to myself that this would be a silly little hero adventure. One of a redemption arc where Ichiban becomes the hero of a big and epic tale. Well, it's kinda like that, it starts off slow and adventurous, but the more the story goes on, Ichiban falls deeper into this crime drama rabbit hole. I will not spoil anything for the sake of letting you enjoy it by yourself, but I can say you're in for a treat. A big one. 

The gameplay itself is, as mentioned earlier, a turn based RPG. I hit you, then I wait, then you hit me, and then you wait. Yakuza 7 adds a nice little twist to that by adding small, simple QTEs to most of your abilities. Sometimes you might have to press a button repeatedly to give it more power, sometimes you might need to press the button at the proper time instead. Sometimes even both! It's a very, very simple thing but it keeps the combat entertaining, which is the main purpose. All attack animations look nice and polished too, some of the names and descriptions are silly and will put a weird look on your face when you first see it, but all skills feels nice to use. You might not have many skills when you first start the game, but the more you progress, the more and more skills will be added to your arsenal.

This game works in a job system, which you might be familiar with if you played some Final Fantasy games. While each character has their own primary main job, they can also switch to other jobs, which in this game are gender locked. Male characters can choose from a variety of different jobs, and female characters have their own jobs to choose from, too. Some of these jobs exist for both genders, although slightly altered, such as Host for males and Hostess for females. They essentially do the same thing, yet they slightly differ from one another.

Now, apart from the amazing story that this game has to offer, and the ability to throw ridiculous-looking skills at your enemies, there's also plenty of minigames that you can play in this game. Of course, there's Karaoke (also with Bakamitai!), Mahjong, Shogi and Dragon Kart (yes, like actual kart racing) just to name a few. Each of these felt well thought out and they're fun to do, and you can seriously get invested in them if you're dedicated enough. Sometimes I booted this game up just to play a little bit of Mahjong...

But there's probably a few negatives about this game, right? Yes there are, but in my personal opinion, these are just minor things that probably won't even bother you unless you think really hard about it. What I disliked during my playthrough is that there's just. so. many. random. encounters. I was told by a friend that this is common in the Yakuza games, and that you'll have to just deal with it, but god there's just so many. Happens a lot that you walk down one street and you get hit with 3 or 4 different encounters that really badly want to murder you. There is an item in this game that completely removes random encounters, but I feel like you'll get access to it way too late. By the time you have it, you're probably able to finish the game for good already. Another issue that I had in this game is that there was one dungeon that just felt way too long to complete. It wasn't even challenging or anything, you just entered a new floor and thought ""this is it"", only to be hit with a wave of disappointment as you realize this is just another floor with the same enemies as the last one. It was a slog to get through it, but luckily it's only a one time thing.

So, what can I say to finalize this review? I think that Yakuza 7 is an amazing game, with a well written and properly thought out story that is guaranteed to keep you glued to your screen, fun and entertaining combat to keep you playing, and a wide variety of different minigames that you grind out, or even just relax with if you feel like. Ichiban and his party makes it feel like you're part of the crew, that his achievements and goals are yours too, and that you too can overcome any obstacle if you just believe in yourself and don't give up. Ichiban Kasuga has been one of the most relateable characters I have ever met and he's found a place in my heart that I will protect. This game has also made me buy all the other main Yakuza games and I'm motivated to play through all of them, at the time of this review I am currently on Yakuza 4 Remastered. As I found out while playing, there are plenty of references to the older Yakuza games that will make you go ""Oooh, I know this"" when you see them, and they still don't feel out of place when you're new to it. I am very happy that this game introduced me to the series and I have no shame admitting that I cried when it was over.",1235140
28,Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,"Heartfelt and great story telling with Final Fantasy/Dragon Quest combat? Awesome!
Never played a Dragon Quest before this one but I think I'll have to say that it's my favorite one.

Ichiban is NOT Kiryu, we trade super manly ideal super strong dad for a gold hearted goofball badass idiot, and its kind of okay, hes way less of a power fantasy and more of a relatable character thats struggling to make it in life, which at times hits too close to home.

28,Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,"[i]--This [b]will[/b] contain some big spoilers. Don't yell at me.--[/i]

The newest entry into the Yakuza franchise, and RGG's first foray into the jRPG genre -- and generally, what a blast this is. It's captivated me with every step and turn, and kept me hooked until the very end -- even with some of its questionable design decisions later in the main storyline.

The game starts out kind of slow, with you learning the ropes in a restrictive tutorial zone throughout Kamurocho. Luckily, this is not how the game stays, and Kamurocho is luckily only a bit of set dressing in this game. Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama, is where the real meat is at -- a delightfully large map (by RGG standards, being that it's four times the size of Kamurocho) with a lot to explore and take in. This is what the game really was designed around, and where the jRPG shenanigans really get into full swing.

Isezaki Ijincho is divided into districts -- each with their own taxi locations that you have to *discover* before you can use them to travel to those locations, making you actually explore and discover Isezaki Ijincho for yourself -- that all have their own ""threat levels."" These threat levels are the game's way of telling you how strong the enemies in an area are -- and thus, how much of a threat they are to you. I love this, I wish more jRPGs told me this info. It's fantastic, and makes the experience of roaming a lot easier, and grinding even easier.

The main story follows Kasuga and his ragtag group of friends throughout the bustling city of Yokohama, as they find themselves slowly wedged into a feud. Bleach Japan are a group that want to cleanse the city of its ""gray zones,"" by any means necessary -- including using Yakuza muscle. Their interactions with BJ, as well as their work for a soapland, eventually lead them to walk into a sprung trap; from there, they really devolve into their big feud, with many twists and turns abound. As always, these games will find a way to make you emotional, and this one might be the most effective at that yet.

As far as gameplay goes, RGG went for a simplistic, but delightful approach. You still roam about the city freely, like any Yakuza game, and the encounters still work similarly as the previous brawler entries -- but it's here where the big twist lies; Upon entering a battle, you are thrown into a very modern jRPG battle system: a simple menu divided into four halves, each for specific functions, your HP/MP counters, and a nice automatic battle system you can opt into and give light directions to. The four-button menu is neatly divided: Attack, Guard, Skills and Miscellaneous. The first three are fairly self-explanatory, and the latter brings you into a second menu for two more items, depending on whose turn it currently is: Items, and if you're Kasuga and have unlocked it, Poundmates. The poundmates are your summons, and include a wild variety from people you meet through sidequests and even a couple through the main story. They're awesome, and a great aid during battles.

Another core mechanic of the game is the Jobs system, which defines what skills, perks and weapons a character can use. Not all characters can have the same jobs, and most of them have in-game requirements to unlock; But rest assured, they're all great and with their own perks, and really allow you to build a good team for your preferred play style. Not to mention they're plenty wacky, with often goofy visuals and animations, to really ham up the silliness of the RPG battle system and its surrounding mechanics.

As I mentioned though, the game does have some critical flaws that have certainly gotten me a bit... [i]annoyed[/i] with the game -- namely how level scaling and difficulty curve intertwine. Up to chapter 9, so long as you do most of the provided content, you will have a breeze of a time, and no hitches. The boss of chapter 9 is where the issues start to arise, where I had to actually start grinding -- but available enemy groups gave little XP for the level I was at, and it was overall just a real slog to get my levels up. That's where a fair chunk of my playtime came from, as that took 32 hours across multiple days where I had the time to go grinding. Okay, so that done -- that was it, right? All good? Nah, it was a breeze up until Chapter 12 -- where it suddenly jumps the difficulty from your general level (Level 32-35 is what I've seen most at, at that stage), up to level 50, with two beefcake bosses that also dish out a friggin' BUTTLOAD of damage. At least this time they offer a battle arena with plenty of battles that dish out XP like scout cookies, and it made the grind a lot quicker! Only 12 hours, as opposed to 32, but that starts to show the issue -- levelling starts to require an inane amount of points, but the game is really stingy about handing that XP out unless you find very specific farming routines. This is where my fun started to fall apart, especially as I approached the final boss and was faced with the reality that I needed to grind again.

The biggest problem with this game, really is its climax. Any sense of satisfaction was taken away from me when I came to realise that the final boss has a conditional One-hit KO. One that favours targeting Kasuga, who, may I add, upon death, is an instant game over. This lead me to have to grind up my levels to a point where I can beat Mister Beefcake, Master of the OHKO, Tanker of All Damage, Owner of Almost All Resists, comfortably and stop his OHKO from actually being an OHKO. I don't know the statistics behind it, or what it's expecting, but it's a darn pain in the butt.

I really felt robbed of a fair chunk of my satisfaction, but even so, I recommend this game wholeheartedly. Just be ready to grind out a lot of stuff. Be ready to get annoyed at this game at spots, as it tells you ""you've not done enough yet!"" But even with all of those grievances, even with it being a slow burn at the start, this game is just a barrel of fun with an expertly written story. I didn't expect a lot of what had gone down in this story, and I'm glad I took my time to play it and enjoy it. Absolutely worth every cent, whether you buy it during a sale or at full price. Support RGG, show them we want more of this, because this was, and is an awesome experience. I'm sure I'll be replaying this with the Japanese VA soon.",1235140
28,Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,"I recommend it to:

-People who don't like JRPGs (vs Western RPGs) but want to find a JRPG they like.
-Similarly, people who are tired of the usual depiction of Japan in media. This game focusses more on the ""streets"" of Japan for lack of a better term, and the everyday people in them. The homeless, prostitutes, petty criminals, sleazy businessmen, etc...
-People who like Gintama, as the humour, setting and characters share many similar features, aesthetics and themes.
-Similarly, people who appreciate over the top and hammy combat as well as stories and situations (usually applies more to side content rather than the main story)
-People who are looking for a video game main character that isn't two googly eyes stuck on a potato. Ichiban is interesting, dynamic, likeable and in a few ways quite relatable.

Major battles don't feel as epic as any of the past game because it is restricted by the battle system.

However, the game is still fun and its first chapters will manage to pull you in with its charms. The battle system is alright but IMO it needs to be less traditional and more inventive, to capture more of what we expect of the Yakuza series when it comes to epic and emotional battles.

On the technical side, the game runs very well on my PC and during my 100+ hours I experienced only one crash. I hope that SEGA continues this quality of publishing on their future PC ports.",1235140

28,Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,"Overall, I really enjoyed this game, it was my entry point into the Yakuza series. It's got lots of heart and humour.

 The turn-based battle system is entertaining  at the onset but can get a bit tedious, mainly due to big spikes in difficulty in the last 3/4 into the game that force you through dungeons to level up.  That said, the endearing cast (well voiced) and interesting (albeit somewhat predictable) story-line kept me going. The cities in the game are lovingly crafted and there are plenty of side quests and mini games to indulge in if that's your kind of thing. 

The game was also really polished (I didn't encounter any bugs) and it ran over 60 fps at 4K (RTX 3080) with no issues whatsoever.  Refreshing in these days of buggy, poorly optimised games.

28,Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,"I held off on getting this game for a while, I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy the turn based combat instead of the traditional beat em up. I'm glad I bought this game and I wish I had sooner. This has become my favorite of the franchise and one of the best games I've ever played. The story is incredible and filled with brilliantly written and acted characters. 

The protagonist, Ichiban, has quite the boots to fill now that we're not playing as Kiryu anymore. Ichiban is an amazing protagonist and without question does Kiryu justice. The emotional range is wider, and the positive outlook on everything that Ichiban invigorates sets him apart from Kiryu. They're both masterpieces of character development, writing and acting. 

The gameplay is incredibly fun and addicting. Leveling up your character as well as the Job you have set at any given time. Jobs are essentially specializations that incorporate different roles like healing, magic/melee, or even tanking. There's tons of loot, materials for crafting gear, and an enormous variety of enemy designs. Since the game has taken this turn into JRPG territory it's allowed more traditional aspects of other RPGs. There's dungeons, tons of bosses and minibosses, an endgame activity that's very difficult, and more. There's well over 100 hours worth of content here and it all improves you and your party's abilities. 

My complaints are negligible, there's sometimes too many enemies on the streets. That's pretty much it, Yakuza Like A Dragon is near perfect and a must play for anyone who's played the previous games and for anyone who wants to jump for the first time into this universe. Playing the previous games isn't necessary.",1235140
28,Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,Unironically one of the best games i've played so far,1235140
28,Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,"Right, where do I start...

Yakuza: Like a Dragon (later in this review Yakuza 7) has been my introduction to the Yakuza franchise as a whole. Prior to this, all I knew about was the Bakamitai meme, which I also only knew as the Dame Da Ne song. I was a bit sceptical about getting into it at first, as I knew absolutely nothing about the game and franchise as a whole, and Brawlers weren't really my thing, but then I heard that this game features a different protagonist, and instead of a Brawler, plays as a turn based RPG. I had some money left over from Christmas, and I'm a big fan of the old Final Fantasy games, so I thought I might as well give it a try. Could always refund it if I didn't enjoy it. 

In Yakuza 7, you play as Ichiban Kasuga, a Yakuza grunt who goes to jail to cover for a higher-ranking member of the Arakawa family, which he belongs to. Thinking that this would make him climb the Yakuza ladder, and that his patriarch will honour and appreciate his cover, he comes back after 18 years of prison time to find out that everybody had abandoned him. Former police officer Koichi Adachi researched about the Tojo Clan and the Arakawa Family, attempts to convince Ichiban to come with him to Yokohama to stay safe, but Ichiban refuses. Ichiban finds his way back to his former patriarch and is then met with an unfortunate fate.

Oh boy, I was immediately hooked from the start. ""That's a lot of cutscenes for a game, it's like I'm watching a movie"" was my first thought. I liked story heavy games, but I felt a little overwhelmed on my first day, as out of the probably 5 or 6 hours that I was playing, 4 of them were just watching cutscenes. Now this might turn some people down, especially if they just want to enjoy the gameplay, but all the introductory scenes got me more invested in finding out about the presented characters and I didn't just want to stop playing until I found a point where I thought ""Okay, now the actual game finally begins.""

The vast majority of this game takes plays in the streets of Yokohama, more specifically, Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama's red light district. The world is incredibly detailed and you'll be pleasantly surprised to know that there's things hidden in every single corner. I really enjoy exploring in video games, trying to see if there's things hidden in places nobody would think of and-- to my surprise, they really thought of everything here. I try sneaking into a corner that I think might not even be intended to go to, and yet, there's something there for me to pick up. 

I personally went for the ""50% main story, 50% side story"" approach, which to me means - I'll do 2 or 3 side quests, of which there are plenty in Yakuza 7, and then I'll do a few story quests so that I can keep up with what is happening. And trust me, there's a lot of content to burn through. All of the sidequests are very well designed, and most of them got at least a little bit of a chuckle from me, so I'd like to think that they are quite humorous. Once done with the sidequests, I grabbed my imaginary bucket of popcorn and started getting immersed in the story. 

After I arrived in Yokohama, and the game properly begun for me, I thought to myself that this would be a silly little hero adventure. One of a redemption arc where Ichiban becomes the hero of a big and epic tale. Well, it's kinda like that, it starts off slow and adventurous, but the more the story goes on, Ichiban falls deeper into this crime drama rabbit hole. I will not spoil anything for the sake of letting you enjoy it by yourself, but I can say you're in for a treat. A big one. 

The gameplay itself is, as mentioned earlier, a turn based RPG. I hit you, then I wait, then you hit me, and then you wait. Yakuza 7 adds a nice little twist to that by adding small, simple QTEs to most of your abilities. Sometimes you might have to press a button repeatedly to give it more power, sometimes you might need to press the button at the proper time instead. Sometimes even both! It's a very, very simple thing but it keeps the combat entertaining, which is the main purpose. All attack animations look nice and polished too, some of the names and descriptions are silly and will put a weird look on your face when you first see it, but all skills feels nice to use. You might not have many skills when you first start the game, but the more you progress, the more and more skills will be added to your arsenal.

This game works in a job system, which you might be familiar with if you played some Final Fantasy games. While each character has their own primary main job, they can also switch to other jobs, which in this game are gender locked. Male characters can choose from a variety of different jobs, and female characters have their own jobs to choose from, too. Some of these jobs exist for both genders, although slightly altered, such as Host for males and Hostess for females. They essentially do the same thing, yet they slightly differ from one another.

Now, apart from the amazing story that this game has to offer, and the ability to throw ridiculous-looking skills at your enemies, there's also plenty of minigames that you can play in this game. Of course, there's Karaoke (also with Bakamitai!), Mahjong, Shogi and Dragon Kart (yes, like actual kart racing) just to name a few. Each of these felt well thought out and they're fun to do, and you can seriously get invested in them if you're dedicated enough. Sometimes I booted this game up just to play a little bit of Mahjong...

But there's probably a few negatives about this game, right? Yes there are, but in my personal opinion, these are just minor things that probably won't even bother you unless you think really hard about it. What I disliked during my playthrough is that there's just. so. many. random. encounters. I was told by a friend that this is common in the Yakuza games, and that you'll have to just deal with it, but god there's just so many. Happens a lot that you walk down one street and you get hit with 3 or 4 different encounters that really badly want to murder you. There is an item in this game that completely removes random encounters, but I feel like you'll get access to it way too late. By the time you have it, you're probably able to finish the game for good already. Another issue that I had in this game is that there was one dungeon that just felt way too long to complete. It wasn't even challenging or anything, you just entered a new floor and thought ""this is it"", only to be hit with a wave of disappointment as you realize this is just another floor with the same enemies as the last one. It was a slog to get through it, but luckily it's only a one time thing.

So, what can I say to finalize this review? I think that Yakuza 7 is an amazing game, with a well written and properly thought out story that is guaranteed to keep you glued to your screen, fun and entertaining combat to keep you playing, and a wide variety of different minigames that you grind out, or even just relax with if you feel like. Ichiban and his party makes it feel like you're part of the crew, that his achievements and goals are yours too, and that you too can overcome any obstacle if you just believe in yourself and don't give up. Ichiban Kasuga has been one of the most relateable characters I have ever met and he's found a place in my heart that I will protect. This game has also made me buy all the other main Yakuza games and I'm motivated to play through all of them, at the time of this review I am currently on Yakuza 4 Remastered. As I found out while playing, there are plenty of references to the older Yakuza games that will make you go ""Oooh, I know this"" when you see them, and they still don't feel out of place when you're new to it. I am very happy that this game introduced me to the series and I have no shame admitting that I cried when it was over.",1235140

However, the game is still fun and its first chapters will manage to pull you in with its charms. The battle system is alright but IMO it needs to be less traditional and more inventive, to capture more of what we expect of the Yakuza series when it comes to epic and emotional battles.

On the technical side, the game runs very well on my PC and during my 100+ hours I experienced only one crash. I hope that SEGA continues this quality of publishing on their future PC ports.",1235140

28,Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,"Overall, I really enjoyed this game, it was my entry point into the Yakuza series. It's got lots of heart and humour.

 The turn-based battle system is entertaining  at the onset but can get a bit tedious, mainly due to big spikes in difficulty in the last 3/4 into the game that force you through dungeons to level up.  That said, the endearing cast (well voiced) and interesting (albeit somewhat predictable) story-line kept me going. The cities in the game are lovingly crafted and there are plenty of side quests and mini games to indulge in if that's your kind of thing. 

The game was also really polished (I didn't encounter any bugs) and it ran over 60 fps at 4K (RTX 3080) with no issues whatsoever.  Refreshing in these days of buggy, poorly optimised games.

30,Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition,Strategy,3590,"Plants vs. Zombies is quite the addictive tower defense game, where you protect the house from goofy-looking zombies, using a variety of flowers and varierty of plants, mushrooms and such. It's quite the relaxing game, and if well the adventure mode is short, it has a lot of replayability with the Adventure Mode replay mode, the Mini-Games, the Puzzle modes, Survival Mode, and also getting upgrades for plants and taking care of stuff at the Zen Garden for some pretty pennies. For a simple game, it has a lot of depth, and the variety of plants makes it open for various strategies.

The graphics are cartoony and vibrant, quite the charming game for his age. As for the music, it has a lot of catchy tunes, composed by Laura Shigihara, bringing a lot of the charm for the music composed for this game.

33,Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,tbh there's not much to say. You develop games. You can choose genres and platforms.  You can follow wiki's combos if you don't want to test them out yourselves. Make money and build up your fan base. Solid time killer 👍,239820
33,Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"This game is great, but provides some ridiculous expectations. While helming my company, Speed Racist, I hired a few programmers that were apparent morons who had never seen computers before. I had to pay these bags of idiocy $35,000 a month just to have a functioning studio. As someone who's worked in the industry, you can put an entire QA team in indentured servitude for a whole year for this amount - just ask CD Project Red.

Additionally, my first game, the dancing simulation wonder Dance France Revolution, had underwhelming sales. I assigned perfect sliders and marketed exclusively to rebellious teenagers trying to break their puritanical roots, but it still flopped. Frankly, I can't fathom a time and place this game wouldn't be a resounding success.

My next foray into gaming, NBA 0K: Christ Rises 4 the Jam, also flopped. Again, due to the considerable idiocy of my team, who spent literal weeks scratching their heads, we scored a solid 3/10 on a genuine gold mine of a franchise. If 2K has taught me anything, it's that it takes no effort to make a sequel to a sports game. 

Overall, it's a fun but frustrating simulation. Obviously, it mimics game development 100%, so if you can succeed at this game you can make a game dev studio. I recommend that we all spend our entire life savings making a game studio that develops game development simulations development. It's a guaranteed success - I know this because my attempt at it scored an 11/10 in Game Dev Tycoon.",239820
33,Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"Quite fun. With plenty of opportunity to test out a different genres and mix them up in the weirdest of ways, a nice way exploring the game developers world. There's plenty of stuffs to do, even after you get the ""victory"" message. Definitely recommended.",239820
33,Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"I've played this game for far longer than 4 hours before I purchased it here (cough). The game is good in theory, but the disconnect between what the game appears to be about (trying to make good games while balancing your time and budget) and is actually about (trying to maximize the difference in quality between the games you make) is incredibly disorienting and frustrating.

Ironically, my first few playthroughs were far more successful than my more recent playthroughs because I got better at making games as the campaign progressed, but once I was able to make a perfect games every time and for lest cost I started getting terrible reviews for every game I made and going bankrupt.

This is because there is no in-game market which your games are compared against, only your own. So, if you make good games early on, your first game will get good reviews and all subsequent games will get mediocre and progressively-worse reviews. If you improve the quality of your games incrementally, this will not outweigh the bad reviews, until you slowly go bankrupt. The game essentially forces you to make bad games and release quality improvements slowly, even if you're capable of doing tons better.

So, basically I find this game very frustrating to play because the way the game expects you to play is so different from the way which is both most intuitive, and in my opinion, the most fun to play. I would recommend against buying or playing it. If you disagree, that's fine, but I'm leaving my review nonetheless in hopes of warning any potential future players.",239820

This game focuses on simple mechanics. You simply put your limited time/resources into focusing on certain aspects of a game which depends on the genre/topic combination. The correct/appealing combinations are generally intuitive to real life, as making an action game with no graphics but a good story is probably gonna be a flop. You have to balance skill/time/money with features and quality. (Features where you decide ""hmm open world or in game economy?""). All of this combines to bring about a really enjoyable experience, and really nails down the point ""you cannot make a game everything.""

Balancing game creation with research is a great balancing act. In-between developing games, you can decide to research certain game features over others, gaining the ability to incorporate it into a gaming engine. You can maximize your time by specializing your research and engines to have features for specific genres and topics (Genres being casual/action/RPG and topics being horror/expeditions/superheros). It also slightly punishes you for being focused on singular topics, as repeating the same old games will get negative reviews, but more than that, it hurts your staff from gaining experience. It all results in an engaging balancing act that encourages your company to focus on specific types of games while trying to explore new ground.

Company building in this game is satisfying, but I was left with wanting more. As you get bigger and better, so does the technology and your competitors. You have to get skilled staff in order to keep up, while also paying them six figure salaries for said staff. You will gradually grow you business to have new tech and offices, even starting your own RnD department to research tech no one has or developing your own hardware. During the later game, I was left with wanting more, to grow my company further. Moreover, the extra departments you only get right when the game ends and the tech advances slow to a halt. Moreover, the mechanics of each department are ""Invest x money and it goes faster"" which is not very satisfying, I was left with wanting more, but it is nice to have what you get.

Bye no means is the game ""10 out of 10, now take my money, all of it."" It will seriously lag when you get four employees, and this is a 2d sim game on my beefcake computer. Moreover, the reviews and little story events eventually become ""click here to gain risk/bonus."" I wish there were more story events to keep me engaged and feeling immersed while I watch little number bubbles tick up to finish a game. There was a lot of potential here and the lack of the story makes this game fall short of the Russian border guard sim ""Papers, Please"" Now, I was not expecting as good of a story or events, but it would have been nice, instead of min-maxing events that have a correct/incorrect answer. Say there is a reviewer that comes along and shits on your game for no reason, or that a competitor copies your game, hurting your sales, and you have branching decisions to deal with. Being now a master gamer developer myself, it does not seem hard to add it with some lines of text and/ codes for debuffs.

Overall, this game is not expensive and is an engaging but simplistic. It does not look like much in the screenshots, but you will generally feel like you are developing video games.

33,Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,tbh there's not much to say. You develop games. You can choose genres and platforms.  You can follow wiki's combos if you don't want to test them out yourselves. Make money and build up your fan base. Solid time killer 👍,239820
33,Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"This game is great, but provides some ridiculous expectations. While helming my company, Speed Racist, I hired a few programmers that were apparent morons who had never seen computers before. I had to pay these bags of idiocy $35,000 a month just to have a functioning studio. As someone who's worked in the industry, you can put an entire QA team in indentured servitude for a whole year for this amount - just ask CD Project Red.

Additionally, my first game, the dancing simulation wonder Dance France Revolution, had underwhelming sales. I assigned perfect sliders and marketed exclusively to rebellious teenagers trying to break their puritanical roots, but it still flopped. Frankly, I can't fathom a time and place this game wouldn't be a resounding success.

My next foray into gaming, NBA 0K: Christ Rises 4 the Jam, also flopped. Again, due to the considerable idiocy of my team, who spent literal weeks scratching their heads, we scored a solid 3/10 on a genuine gold mine of a franchise. If 2K has taught me anything, it's that it takes no effort to make a sequel to a sports game. 

Overall, it's a fun but frustrating simulation. Obviously, it mimics game development 100%, so if you can succeed at this game you can make a game dev studio. I recommend that we all spend our entire life savings making a game studio that develops game development simulations development. It's a guaranteed success - I know this because my attempt at it scored an 11/10 in Game Dev Tycoon.",239820
33,Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"Quite fun. With plenty of opportunity to test out a different genres and mix them up in the weirdest of ways, a nice way exploring the game developers world. There's plenty of stuffs to do, even after you get the ""victory"" message. Definitely recommended.",239820
33,Game Dev Tycoon,Simulation,239820,"I've played this game for far longer than 4 hours before I purchased it here (cough). The game is good in theory, but the disconnect between what the game appears to be about (trying to make good games while balancing your time and budget) and is actually about (trying to maximize the difference in quality between the games you make) is incredibly disorienting and frustrating.

Ironically, my first few playthroughs were far more successful than my more recent playthroughs because I got better at making games as the campaign progressed, but once I was able to make a perfect games every time and for lest cost I started getting terrible reviews for every game I made and going bankrupt.

Play casually, or challenge yourself by meeting the level conditions in order to get the achievement(s) for the stage. Earning the stage achievement(s) seems to give you more experience than without earning them, and goes towards unlocking songs with each level up. Regardless of whether or not you actually get the stage achievement(s), you still earn experience, and you obtain miscellaneous items that are used to unlock characters, companions, etc.

-Great sync and flow to the maps
-Overall very fitting songs to the game

-The style to unlock more songs and difficult songs
-Unnecessary fanservice that can leave an odd taste in your mouth should you stumble upon it.
-A lot of maps are restricted and you need to buy the DLC to get them, and that thing is EXPENSIVE

34,Muse Dash,Casual,774171,"If you're looking for a non-bland rhythm game, this is a must-try. Vibrant colors, exciting music, unusual music notes, and horizontal gameplay, are what made Muse Dash a unique rhythm game.

From my 15 hours of playing, Muse Dash is quite easy to get a grasp since it only has 2 lines of notes, but quite difficult to master, especially the speed and patterns in higher difficulties. There are up to 3 difficulties in a single song, which leaves you no worries of not being able to complete your favorite song.

It might take quite a time to get used to the game due to its unusual music notes and horizontal gameplay. Also, high refresh rate monitors (120Hz+) are recommended.

For the cons, the game has specific characters and elfins (a creature floating next to the character) which can help boost your score. Simply, the score isn't solely based on your ability, but also the character and elfin selection, which is the feature I quite dislike.

I also hope for the game to make more use of the Steam features not just putting the game up in the store, for example, Steam achievements, collectible cards, and ranking between friends.

Overall, Muse Dash is really an exciting game with many pros and a cheap price that anyone can try. If you really love the game, there is a DLC for you to pick up, which helps you level up faster, unlocks tons of more songs, and a few characters.",774171

So, this is a very good game so far. I love cleaning things with a pressure washer.
The level´s are very cool and the gameplay is really fun. I would like to see a lot more missions in the future.
The only thing that !bothers! me is just that the game steals the dirt. Just before finishing a component, the game washes away the dirt on its own.
That takes the fun a little out of the game, because you want to clean up the dirt by yourself.

37,PowerWash Simulator,Casual,1290000,"As someone who enjoys the cleaning portion of House Flipper more than the decorating and selling parts... man, this game was a dream come true.

The game is early access, so I can only hope that it'll be improved over time, but I think it's a great game if you want to do something peaceful and monotonous for a few hours. It seems like it takes ~15-16 hours to finish the available jobs.

My current criticisms are that the game really needs to balance out its criteria for enough dirt having been washed away to consider a segment complete--it'll either jump to finished with a substantial chunk left to clean and deprive you of that experience, or you'll spend forever walking around in circles, hitting tab, trying to find the angle that'll show you the minuscule speck of dirt that's left to clean up. 

Definitely recommend if you like the cleaning portions of House Flipper or Viscera Cleanup Detail, although it's a little flatter on the ground so far than either of those.",1290000

The premise is simple you have to Jet Wash random things from motorbikes to giant houses and you'd think that sounds really boring but it's actually really fun!  The graphics are awesome, the effect of the water cleaning stuff on different surfaces is really cool, being able to upgrade your Jet with different parts and is cool, but the best part is most definitely the feeling of accomplishment you get when you hear the 'ding' after finishing a section.",1290000

37,PowerWash Simulator,Casual,1290000,"This game is great for when you need to sit back and let your ADHD brain experience something soothing and something you can completely sink into. Similar feeling to using a real power washer or watching a video of one. I am a completionist myself and I speed through games like nobody's business; however, for some maps it takes me days to complete. It makes me want to take a break and come back to it the next day and most games can't hold my attention like that. Once again def get this game.",1290000

37,PowerWash Simulator,Casual,1290000,"Hello Dev´s.
So, this is a very good game so far. I love cleaning things with a pressure washer.
The level´s are very cool and the gameplay is really fun. I would like to see a lot more missions in the future.
The only thing that !bothers! me is just that the game steals the dirt. Just before finishing a component, the game washes away the dirt on its own.
That takes the fun a little out of the game, because you want to clean up the dirt by yourself.

So, greetings. Ya Raccoon.",1290000

37,PowerWash Simulator,Casual,1290000,"As someone who enjoys the cleaning portion of House Flipper more than the decorating and selling parts... man, this game was a dream come true.

The game is early access, so I can only hope that it'll be improved over time, but I think it's a great game if you want to do something peaceful and monotonous for a few hours. It seems like it takes ~15-16 hours to finish the available jobs.

My current criticisms are that the game really needs to balance out its criteria for enough dirt having been washed away to consider a segment complete--it'll either jump to finished with a substantial chunk left to clean and deprive you of that experience, or you'll spend forever walking around in circles, hitting tab, trying to find the angle that'll show you the minuscule speck of dirt that's left to clean up. 

Definitely recommend if you like the cleaning portions of House Flipper or Viscera Cleanup Detail, although it's a little flatter on the ground so far than either of those.",1290000
37,PowerWash Simulator,Casual,1290000,"Ok so when I first went to purchase this I thought it's gonna be one of those sims I spend 10 mins in and get bored but its 6 hours in and I can't get enough! haha.  The premise is simple you have to Jet Wash random things from motorbikes to giant houses and you'd think that sounds really boring but it's actually really fun!  The graphics are awesome, the effect of the water cleaning stuff on different surfaces is really cool, being able to upgrade your Jet with different parts and is cool, but the best part is most definitely the feeling of accomplishment you get when you hear the 'ding' after finishing a section.",1290000
37,PowerWash Simulator,Casual,1290000,"If you enjoyed the cleaning portion of House Flipper, I think you would like this game. It's very fun and relaxing. It's the perfect game to play while listening to a podcast. And it's very satisfying seeing the stuff you clean become nice and shiny.",1290000

38,Super Animal Royale,Massively%20Multiplayer,843380,"Alright so I've seen a lot of my friends finally start playing this game so I might as well write this review.

I've been addicted to this game for a while now and there are only a couple of small issues with the game that aren't game breaking. The game is fun, a lot of fun with friends. It's the only battle royale game I like and I dont feel bad about playing it often.

I've met a ton of friends on this game as well, some insanely close friends and I always look forward to playing it with them. The developers of this game are also so kind and caring and I'm glad to even know a couple.

This is definitely a game worth your time to check out, it's free as well so why not give it a try?",843380
38,Super Animal Royale,Massively%20Multiplayer,843380,"Honestly, I love this game.  It's fast, cute, hilarious and fun.  With that said, and I hate that I'm leaving a negative review for this, I feel like I've been lied to by the developers.

The recent update brought 'cross-play' to the game.  To quote the developers, this means 'cross-play matchmaking support for Steam and Xbox players to play together'.  In literally every game that's ever been cross-play (that I can remember at least), that means you and your console peasant friends on different systems can finally play a game together.

But that's not the case here- you will play -against- people from other platforms (with PC having the obvious advantage), but you cannot play -with- people from other platforms.  This was never explained pre-update, nor has it been explained since.  After talking this game up for over a month with my Xbox friends (who I can never game with as I'm a PC master race guy), I discovered that you cannot party up with people on other platforms- you can only (possibly) play against them at random.  Oh, and half of my unlocks that I spent weeks/months on magically disappeared, so that was cool too.

This is confusing at best, misleading at worst, and regardless of where your personal thoughts fall on this scale, ultimately disappointing.  Please devs, if you're reading this or hearing similar feedback, fix this or at least explain it.",843380

No, not even close, it can be really intense and crazy despite the looks of the game. And when you down to the wire everyone flying over the place maneuvering and trying to outshout and outplay you it's such an adrenaline rush sometimes. And when you come out on top whether solo or with a squad and the match is over. It just makes you go ""whew, that was crazy!"", then you just want to keep playing more. 

Also, matches are pretty quick too (5-10 minutes if you were to reach it to the end) and thats a major thing I like. Also, unlike most BR/Multiplayer games where if you quit you may get a temporary suspension or put into a ""bad player lobby"" like major retail games, you don't get penalized other than you won't recieve XP/drops. Not that I like quitters, but if you are a person with bad internet/disconnection, or if something comes up urgently, or if you have to get off the computer expecting an average game of ~45 minutes turns into a 2 hour match for no real good reason  (*cough cough* Dota 2, LoL, etc. etc.), its the worst feeling getting penalized for it.",843380

39,There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension,Casual,1240210,"In [i]There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension[/i], you play as a User who is attempting to play a video game only to be dissuaded by the narrator, known only as The Game, who says that there is in fact no game and the User should just do something else. The User attempts to do an end-run around The Game which only unleashes a glitch in the programming and sets the duo off on a bizarre, meta, and comedic adventure through gaming.

This game is an expansion of the short and similarly titled [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1241700/There_Is_No_Game_Jam_Edition_2015/]There Is No Game[/url][/i] (2015). It is mainly a comedy type game parodying video gaming while also containing several puzzles to solve.

To start with one of the best aspects of this game, the art used is excellent throughout. The style throughout most of the game is stylized pixel art. I found that the art was beautifully done in all respects not just for the main scenes of the game, but it also nails different styles of art from the games it parodies from the 1990s. The game's creators really did a great job of mostly sticking to pixel art, but using it in a variety of creative ways to create different types of scenes.

The sound design works quite well in multiple respects, too. The music in the game is a joy to listen to. As with the artwork, there are many types of musical tracks depending on the section of the game from a heartfelt song about love and loss to a hilarious rap track. The sound in the game is bolstered by the excellent narration work done by Pascal Cammisotto playing The Game and a few other characters as well (and who also was a writer).

The real meat of this game would be the writing and story. As mentioned above, this is mainly a comedy and parody game. I will try to avoid spoilers here as it is best to go into the game knowing little for the fullest enjoyment. I will say that the writing and experience of the game is quite enjoyable. At its core, the game is essentially a parody of video games much in the same vein as [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/221910/The_Stanley_Parable]The Stanley Parable[/url][/i] (2013). Indeed, it seems that [i]There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension[/i] took much inspiration from [i]The Stanley Parable[/i] from the over-the-top narrator frustrating or being frustrated by the human player to the meta humor and commentary on video gaming as a medium. Suffice it to say that if you liked the type of humor and writing in a game like [i]The Stanley Parable[/i], you will enjoy [i]There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension[/i].

In addition to the meta-humor, the game nails its parodies of video games themselves taking a good amount of inspiration from games of the 1990s. These parodies include a sequence based on LucasArts adventure games such as [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/388210/Day_of_the_Tentacle_Remastered/]Day of the Tentacle[/url][/i] (1993) and some of the earlier titles of [i]The Legend of Zelda[/i] series. The game does a good job of evoking the styles, including art and sound, of these games.

While mostly a comedic game, this also contains many puzzles to solve to progress the story. I found that the puzzles were enjoyable and not so difficult as to be aggravating. The game does have a built-in hint system if you truly get stuck while the narration will offer a few subtle clues to push you in the right direction. Some of the puzzles were definitely on the easier side, though, so if you really want to play this specifically for the puzzles, you may be disappointed.

Overall, I really enjoyed what this game had to offer with its bizarre and meta sense of humor, stunning graphics, and enjoyable music. I only scratched the surface with the type of writing to expect in this game as there is much to discover. I would recommend this game to those looking for something comedic with some puzzle solving along the way.",1240210

While I love this game, and spend lots of hours practising, but it seems the game has a lot to do with lucky and skill. I can take criticism time and time again and improve my scores only so much on a recognised course, but I fail to see how some unthinkable score cards are a reflection of my ability to play your game. We all have very basic access to the likely basic controls of the game.

This has led me to understand and notice some understandable yet doable updates. 
1. Improve the speed at which we painlessly can watch our ball roll to any place on the map that isn't in the hole. Yes this would include out of bounds areas that auto glitch to last play position. I am aware there are sweet points off grid course. I don't need to see it roll along...or float...I know this is possible as older games have it. Just a thought. please.

2. More direction on the course. You offer a brief ability to skim the course ahead. 15 sec. In many cases this is not long enough for me. In turn, I fail to get an appropriate angle at a shot. Assuming I haven't used all my view time. If there is a way to keep the flag option on during play that would make a huge difference.

3. The roll and bounce of the ball is a little too much. I'm not sure if there will or can be settings which would allow for more realistic bounce. Its a little tricky to gauge the need of shot at times. Even with the meter level reader. The problem may be in the environment settings and not the game play. Shot which roll in different points of any course have varying effects. Not sure if a settings open in general can be added to reduce realistic values if this is a standard mode. Perhaps a more relaxed version.

4. Great game Overall. I would enjoy it more if it had more holes by steam as well. Super awesome this came out. A nice way to sit back and hound away at a ball. or Puck. Golf With your Friends 2 will be great with all the other suggestions i've seen. The workshop has been a blast to play.

42,VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"-I bought this game and played it YEARS ago. It was featured a lot at the 2016 vidya gaem awards and I though it looked really cute. 

-I never played a VN before so I was afraid I wasn't going to be kept engaged in the story, but that's why the drink mixing minigame is there. Serving as an incentive to keep you focused to receive optimal dialogue between Jill and her clients and it works perfectly. I found myself being invested in some of the characters hoping I'd be able to see them again soon, or being riddled with curiosity when a new customer stumbled into the bar and what their story was. I was encapsulated and didn't want to put the game down back then, but I did, I'll talk about that later and with a spoiler warning. 
-VA-11 Hall-A, provides probably one of the most human experiences in a video game that I can think of. Working in a service style job and listening to the everyday problems of , for the most part, regular people. They're so well established as people with their own lives that sometimes you don't get conclusions to some of their stories. As it currently stands, some of them are still working their jobs and have their ongoing problems. It's really bittersweet. I may never know how their story concludes, but I'm happy they came across Valhalla however they did, and felt comfortable enough to share their stories with me.

[b]Warning spoilers ahead for one of the major themes of the story[/b]
[spoiler]I want to preface this with a personal story, I stopped talking with my mother a couple of years before this game. I don't really remember the reason, but she wasn't evil and didn't do anything that made me distrust her. I was just incredibly frustrated and hurt one day, and I left her to live with my dad. Years passed and I started wondering I left so abruptly and without word, and I started to feel bad about it. However, I couldn't bring myself to talk to her. I felt so much fear, anxiety, anger(?) with the idea of finally confronting her and talking about it.[/spoiler]
[spoiler]Those that have played the game probably know why I'd bother bringing this up. Jill's relationship with Lenore and Gaby and how that ended, before resurfacing years later forcing Jill to confront Gaby and talk about what happened, reminded me of my situation with my mother. I cried for a while before saving my progress and quitting the game. I didn't resume my playthrough for a while after that.[/spoiler]

-Years later after an emotional break, that I eventually solved, I came back to finish the game I was so invested with from the beginning. It only felt fair to give the game a fair completion for what it had provided me. With a fresh start with the intention to get the good ending, I set off to experience the world again. Remembering all the ups and downs as I had experienced them initially.  Finally finishing the base game recently, I'm finally comfortable enough to try and put my feelings into positive words for the game.
-My words may be jumbled and excessive, but I don't know how else to express how much I love what this game offers and what it means to me.",447530

42,VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,Casual,447530,"[i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] was a surprisingly potent and intelligent game, even if it did have some misses here and there.

Going into this title, I did not have any sort of expectations as to how the game would go. Seeing as it was a bartending game, I wasn't positive if it would be a very involved or overly simplistic approach to said genre of food preparation releases. Well, the gameplay is a bit strange at first and you might need to practice with the system for a few minutes, but after you get a basic grasp of it, the game is rather simple. Sure, there are some orders you must know to serve with intuition and deduction skills, but besides this, it would be hard to fail a day or somehow manage not to pay your rent on time, which is the main objective of the game. There are items you can buy to increase your performance later on during your shift, websites you can visit to squeeze out more lore from the game, and even a mini-game you can attempt to complete on the side after purchasing the game console in the aforementioned store. Luckily, the main focus is not on the gameplay, but rather, the characters and the narrative they are all intertwined in in some way or another, as the gameplay, in all honest, would not be strong enough to carry an entire game. 

[i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] is more so about the people that walk into your place of work and tell you about recent news, personal information, and just small talk about whatever they find worthwhile. You can build relationships with them through getting their orders correct, and in some cases, deciding what is best for them under certain circumstances, which can unlock their respective endings if you guess correctly. What I did not really expect from this game that I got was a sense of maturity when handling certain subject matters, such as dealing with grief and moving forward in life. What I did sort of expect, however, were unrealistic fantastical elements that are reminiscent of other anime-inspired pieces. When I say fantastical, it is not to say that it is enchanting, but rather unrealistic. Obviously, this game is not meant to be realistic in the slightest when it comes to the premise, but there are good and bad qualities pertaining to being unrealistic one must compare to understand what I mean. Cat woman cyborg hybrids and talking dogs with Hawaiian shirts and sunglasses can be charming and creative additions to a game, but when you attempt to create a game or really any media that is both funny and serious, there had to be a good balancing act taking place. Most of the time, the game does a great job, but sometimes, it misses and I was left with either a bad taste in my mouth or just bored and uninvolved.

During the game, there will be very eventful days and some throwaway ones. Since the game is focused on the rather mundane goal of being able to afford a porn subscription (yes, that is the first primary objective) and ultimately pay your rent, the ending feels rather anticlimactic as a result. Even though there is a main plot point that takes hold around the halfway point which gives the player a look further into the protagonist's  past and present personal life and this leads the rest of the story to this specific concluding point, the point still stands that this piece can lack direction at times. Now, if you have seen any type of story in which this type of character development takes place (meaning the one [i]Jill[/i], the protagonist, faces), you won't really get that much more out of the way this story goes through the same motions, especially because it doesn't try to do anything but the bare minimum to get across its message. Some other characters fell flat for me as well, such as [i]Dana[/i], the boss, and [i]Gillian[/i], your co-bartender, leaving two core characters I was supposed to be acquainted with not fulfilling their purpose, which is rather disappointing in its own right.

Besides these two main gripes, though, I really did have a good time with this game. It surprised me in some ways that I didn't really expect and made up for its flaws in other ways, such as the brilliant art design, sound direction, and character interaction. A lot can be forgiven since it is not supposed to be some brilliant or profound work, which is why I only really fault it for what it lacks as far as the [i]Slice of Life[/i] and [i]Visual Novel[/i] genres go because that is what it is at its core. [i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] is a quaint and heartfelt hybrid that is worthwhile to play through, even if it may not seem life your type of game, as it is more mature than many of its contemporaries and makes an attempt at being human even when dealing with a cybernetic and perhaps even dystopian future.

Most of the time, the game does a great job, but sometimes, it misses and I was left with either a bad taste in my mouth or just bored and uninvolved.

During the game, there will be very eventful days and some throwaway ones. Since the game is focused on the rather mundane goal of being able to afford a porn subscription (yes, that is the first primary objective) and ultimately pay your rent, the ending feels rather anticlimactic as a result. Even though there is a main plot point that takes hold around the halfway point which gives the player a look further into the protagonist's  past and present personal life and this leads the rest of the story to this specific concluding point, the point still stands that this piece can lack direction at times. Now, if you have seen any type of story in which this type of character development takes place (meaning the one [i]Jill[/i], the protagonist, faces), you won't really get that much more out of the way this story goes through the same motions, especially because it doesn't try to do anything but the bare minimum to get across its message. Some other characters fell flat for me as well, such as [i]Dana[/i], the boss, and [i]Gillian[/i], your co-bartender, leaving two core characters I was supposed to be acquainted with not fulfilling their purpose, which is rather disappointing in its own right.

Besides these two main gripes, though, I really did have a good time with this game. It surprised me in some ways that I didn't really expect and made up for its flaws in other ways, such as the brilliant art design, sound direction, and character interaction. A lot can be forgiven since it is not supposed to be some brilliant or profound work, which is why I only really fault it for what it lacks as far as the [i]Slice of Life[/i] and [i]Visual Novel[/i] genres go because that is what it is at its core. [i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] is a quaint and heartfelt hybrid that is worthwhile to play through, even if it may not seem life your type of game, as it is more mature than many of its contemporaries and makes an attempt at being human even when dealing with a cybernetic and perhaps even dystopian future.

It's a lot more.
It's an anonymous network that allows people from all over the world to share their woes, or hear a kind word or two to brighten up their day.
I need to seriously define this right away: 
[b]This game is NOT a source of professional mental help, and must not be treated as such.[/b]
This is a way to express your current feelings/worries, be it happyness or apathy, but it nonetheless provides a way to find professional support easier -- there are several sources listed in this game, and should a request be beyond one's competence, you can always report it as ""Worrying"" to have the game's moderators send a list of helpful sources to the person in question.
Still -- it's a pleasing little zen-microcosm with a warm and endearing colour palette, and a lovely soundtrack composed by Clark Aboude.
And it's a place you can always turn to when you just need to hear an uplifting word or two. There's people from all walks of life here, and if you have a problem, you can surely at least discuss it here.
Whatever the case, someone in Kind Words is always all-ears. As an exception to what you may expect from the Internet, the letters here are sincere, genuine, even heartfelt. The friendly community that this game has created given its complete anonymity is nothing short of a wonder.
Sadly, there's the odd outliers every once in a while, but they're definitely a minority. There's so many nice people here that you'll be surprised -- I sure was. These people helped me out immensely with things I'd find hard to even spill to people I hold closest.
Still, as said before:
[b]Kind Words is not fit for replacement of professional mental aid, be it therapy, or counseling, but Kind Words is a perfect additive to such treatment, or even your life in general.[/b]
And, well, it costs less than a coffee. Definitely try it out.

43,Kind Words (lo fi chill beats to write to),Casual,1070710,"Kind Words made me feel very special when I first launched it. I had never seen a place on the Internet where everyone was so nice and friendly while also remaining completely anonymous. Most of us know from first-hand experience that anonymity tends to bring forth the worst in people, but something about this app keeps the vile and the bitter at bay. Suffice it to say that I [i]almost[/i] shed a single manly tear while going through paper aeroplane letters with simple encouragements and words of wisdom. This was a special moment; I was thinking to myself that I'd found the ultimate way of spending my free time – writing supportive letters to strangers, asking for advice and guidance myself, using screensavers with chill lo-fi music while I'm working or studying. However, what felt like love turned out to be a mere infatuation that died as quickly as it had come – four hours later it was gone without a trace. If you look at other reviewers, you will notice a similar trend.

[h1]Why?[/h1]

Well, ask yourself: [b]do you [i]actually[/i] need Kind Words?[/b] I mean, have you got something gnawing away at your heart, something that keeps you awake at night, the burden you want to get off your chest? Maybe the stuff that you wouldn't share with your dearest friend or even your loved ones for fear of judgement or ridicule? Do you have any mental health issues; are you depressed? If so, then this application might be just the right thing for you, and it's the main reason I recommend it. However, I'm happy to say that I don't really need any help or words of support; I'm doing all right, have been for a long time now, and I'm planning to keep it that way. The only option for me (and for many of you as well, I suppose) would then be to respond to requests submitted by those whom I described above. This might be very rewarding for a couple of hours and you might feel like you're actually making a bit of a difference, but...
[list]

[*]...the requests are a mess. [i]""What's your favourite band/videogame/book?"", ""Tell me about something good/bad that happened to you today"", ""I want stickers, send me stickers!"", ""Tell me a joke – looking to laugh out loud!""[/i] – these are so common that sifting through the list gets a bit frustrating at times. People forget that Kind Words is not supposed to be a run-of-the-mill chat app, but a safe space for those who are struggling. Problems don't end there; if you are hurting and you want to submit a request, you're only allowed to do so in a very limited number of lines. This drives many people to send multiple requests as parts of one story and give them numbers: 1/3, 2/3, 3/3... Unfortunately, you view a random selection of requests in no particular order, and oftentimes stumble upon a ""2/3"" with no way of knowing what the person is talking about as there is no way to read neither the beginning nor the end of it;

[*]...your letters can only be 14 lines long, and the influence of this limitation is tremendous. I understand that the developers made a conscious choice here and I see why they would do that – no need to write a scientific thesis in reply to a simple request asking for a piece of advice – but what I've found is that this restriction kills the uniqueness of each letter and stifles its potential impact. Most things you'll send are bound to be generic [i]""Don't worry, it'll be all right"".[/i] [u]The person who's hurting is not allowed to express their feelings completely,[/u] thus forced to send multiple requests and have their voices not be heard, and [u]you're barely able to offer anything other than a few watery clichés,[/u] those hang ons and stay strongs, with very few exceptions.
[/list]

By and large, if you're doing fine and life is good, Kind Words will test the very nature of your supposed altruism. Are you able to put up with these things that turned me away so fast? Maybe. But I still think that if you want to [b][i]give[/i][/b], you also need to be able to [b][i]receive[/i][/b] in return – at least that's how I believe it works with most people. Only replying to requests and not leaving any will create an imbalance, the feeling of an annoying chore which is bound to get old fairly quickly, and the issues I told you about won't make it any easier. Keep this in mind when you decide to purchase. 

However, if it takes everything that you have to face the day, if you feel like a disappointment, if your heart is broken, if your loved one is sick – there is probably no better virtual place you can be, even with all its shortcomings. Nothing beats professional help, of course, but Kind Words comes to your aid if seeking counsel is not an option.

44,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,its ok,250900
44,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"Alright, I've waited years to do this, and finally it's time to put forth a review here.

For context, Isaac was one of the two games (the other being Spelunky) that got me to dump AAA games and switch to almost exclusively playing indies (AAA games getting progressively more slimy and worthless also helped though).  That was the ORIGINAL Isaac, and it was seriously just THAT DARNED GOOD.  And then Rebirth came out and upgraded EVERYTHING.  Needless to say, this is by far one of my favorite games of all time.  Top 3, I'd say.  Considering I've been gaming since the days of the 2600... that's extremely high praise.

So yeah.  I like it.  But I'm going to do this review a bit different.  Instead of talking about what the game is like and all of that like I usually do, let's just go over some good/bad points, and maybe a bit about the expansions.

First, the good.  Well, there is a LOT of good here.  The design of basically everything is outright masterful, and there is an absolutely stupid amount of content here.  An absolutely astonishing number of items, enemies, bosses, areas, and so on.  Getting 1000+ hours out of this game isnt exactly unheard of, and it's very easy to see why.

What's more, despite the roguelike nature of it, Isaac is a skill-based game.  RNG cant kill you... unless you let it.  Skill, knowledge, and making good decisions... like any good roguelike, that's what wins runs for you here.  This is a game that gets it RIGHT.  ...Mostly.  With 20 bazillionty enemies/bosses/rooms you do get a dud here and there, occaisional things that rather need an overhaul as they can produce unavoidable attacks.  Fortunately, this is quite rare (and expansions make it more rare).  But still, it DOES happen every now and then.  

Also, the items you find are often just lots of fun to use.  So many creative concepts here.  And the concept of wild synergies just adds to the fun, and makes it so that runs can be so wildly different from one another that even 800+ hours in (I have the game on other platforms) I *still* am surprised by it at times.

Character variety also goes a long way here... there's a darned wide cast of dudes to pick from, and drastically moreso if you buy the expansions.  

The controls are superb, though one small issue is that Isaac's hitbox is... strange.  Even to this day I sometimes find myself not *quite* sure just where it is, particularly as his sprite evolves and warps as you get items.  That's a pretty minor issue though.

And the game can be so darned exciting... when it's being challenging.

One major issue that I've always had with Isaac is that, by default, it is simply far, far too easy.  If you're used to other roguelikes, this one in its base state will be child's play to you.  It has ""balance issues"", and that's putting it VERY mildly.  The game is FAR too easy, allowing the player to become an overpowered disaster almost every run once you know how (and it sure aint hard to figure out how).  While some players like that, I've always found it fantastically boring... I'm sorry, but ""enter room and push win button"" over and over again in 70% of runs isnt very interesting and I find that my interest fades very fast... up until recently, while I love the game, I didnt PLAY it all that often due to the fact that the absolute lack of challenge would cause me to lose interest fast.

Fortunately, that changed with Repentance.  That DLC performs an absolute overhaul of the game's balance, and turns it into more of a PROPER roguelike... darned difficult, and drastically less common that you will get overpowered.  It becomes more in line with other games in this genre, and to me that is a very good thing.  Not to mention that DLC also just adds tons of amazing content.  So, if you want any actual challenge... make sure to pick that up, otherwise you really wont find much of any.  The game is seriously mindless without it.

But, even with that, there are still other issues.  Two particular things stand out to me:  The absolutely atrocious unlock system, and the fact that the game NEVER EXPLAINS ANYTHING.  Wanna know what that item there does?  Well TOO BAD because it will not tell you.  Better learn by trial and error and then MEMORIZE the many 100s of items in here.  Or, better yet, get Afterbirth+ (which adds mod support) and just get the item description mod.  Without that... hoboy, better get used to alt-tabbing.

But then there's the unlock system... I hate it.  I *HATE* it.  Look, I grew up in the days of really primitive games... the 2600 and NES for instance.  I do not, and never will, understand modern gaming's obsession with achievements and unlocks.  But honestly, even for those who DO understand, this is likely to still be a massive source of frustration.  SO MANY FREAKING THINGS are locked behind arbitrary and often irritating nonsense, some of which genuinely does require that the RNG be very kind to you.  Other things are just stupidly annoying, like trying to beat X final boss with The Lost (a challenge character who dies if you look at him too hard).  Or doing ANYTHING with Jacob and Esau (from Repentance) who are fun enough, but who DO NOT work well with unlocks, as the game is not formatted for their bizarre dual hitbox.  An absolutely astonishing amount of things require that you unlock them before using them, and that is... irritating.  It is by far my biggest complaint with the game.

Also, there are expansions!  Great stuff really.  Afterbirth is pretty basic... it is MOAR STUFF, lots of fun things.  Afterbirth+ also adds MOAR STUFF, but is truly about modding the game.  You can customize your experience and play it how YOU want to!  People have come up with some incredibly creative and fun things.  One thing to note: you MUST have Afterbirth+ to use Repentance.

And Repentance itself is, to me, the best of all.  It is Antibirth integrated officially into the game, with way more added on top.  And like I said, it rebalances EVERYTHING.  OP broken things are nerfed, but even moreso, about a bazillion items got buffed.  The game is far harder, and there are alternate levels, even more endings, and ALL of the content is just SO FREAKING GOOD.

One thing I do want to mention though:  particularly with Repentance, this game is at its best when you DONT just stick to ""the meta"" (which is frankly something I say about all roguelikes).  EXPERIMENT with the different items.  Despite what some players may say, I genuinely think there are very, very few ACTUALLY bad items in the game.  Like, less than 10.  There are certainly some situational items out there (and deciding when to take something and when NOT to is a big part of the game!) but that sure doesnt make them bad... learn when they work well, and when they dont.  USE EVERYTHING... even if you've used it before and it seemed bad.  Again, this is seriously advice for the entire genre.  But this DLC *really* ups the need to approach it this way, if you want the best experience and the most fun.

And dont be afraid of losing.  Dont let it bother you when it happens.  Again, good advice for the entire genre, not just this.

There is honestly sooo much more I could say about this game, and almost all of it is positive.  But you know, Steam character limit.

One way or another... it is fantastic.  One of the best.  And the DLC just makes it way better.  It does have a couple of odd issues, sure, but those can be fixed in many cases (with the DLCs) and for those that cant be fixed, well... the rest is just so darned good that those problems get a pass.

Just amazing.  Congratulations to Edmund and his team for creating something so incredible.  And then improving on it even further.

...Seriously get the DLCs though. They are great.",250900

44,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"i have to say, this is a DAMN good game. this was the first game that got me into roguelike games and it did an amazing job at introducing me to the genre. the story of the game is that there is a boy named Isaac who lives with his mother alone, one day however, god tells Isaac's mother to kill him as a way to prove her devotion to him. if you couldn't already tell, this game has a big take on religion. I won't go too in depth with the story or anything but what is a simple story turns into something way more sinister as you keep playing. the game has multiple endings which each tell a part of the story and let me tell you, there are a lot of endings, you get a new one each time you complete a run however later on you will need to do more than just finish a run to achieve the last few endings, some endings will require you to get certain items but you won't need to worry about that until much later on.

just like other roguelike games, when you die, you lose everything and have to restart from the beginning however there are items that can be obtained which allow you to die more than once but I've only ever got those on rare occasions. you may not like it at first because of the whole 1 life thing but just keep playing and you'll get better, that's how i went about playing this anyway and it's one of my favourite games of all time now",250900

44,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"Alright, I've waited years to do this, and finally it's time to put forth a review here.

For context, Isaac was one of the two games (the other being Spelunky) that got me to dump AAA games and switch to almost exclusively playing indies (AAA games getting progressively more slimy and worthless also helped though).  That was the ORIGINAL Isaac, and it was seriously just THAT DARNED GOOD.  And then Rebirth came out and upgraded EVERYTHING.  Needless to say, this is by far one of my favorite games of all time.  Top 3, I'd say.  Considering I've been gaming since the days of the 2600... that's extremely high praise.

So yeah.  I like it.  But I'm going to do this review a bit different.  Instead of talking about what the game is like and all of that like I usually do, let's just go over some good/bad points, and maybe a bit about the expansions.

First, the good.  Well, there is a LOT of good here.  The design of basically everything is outright masterful, and there is an absolutely stupid amount of content here.  An absolutely astonishing number of items, enemies, bosses, areas, and so on.  Getting 1000+ hours out of this game isnt exactly unheard of, and it's very easy to see why.

What's more, despite the roguelike nature of it, Isaac is a skill-based game.  RNG cant kill you... unless you let it.  Skill, knowledge, and making good decisions... like any good roguelike, that's what wins runs for you here.  This is a game that gets it RIGHT.  ...Mostly.

I started playing this so much to the point that going beyond extremely difficult bosses made me empty inside, I have no more desires and no emotions while playing this because it's like I suffered long term hypnosis and didn't realize that I spent every afternoon of my week playing again... and again... and again...
It took me a long time to decide to write a review about this game, but I can't blame myself for that, as I was too busy getting hooked on it to remember to do anything else important in my life.
I spent days forgetting to eat lunch while playing this wonder, and after Hollow Knight became my favorite game, I realized it's a path of no return... but not a path of pain like the one in the game, but a path of emotion and happiness, and that's why you should stop looking at the reviews and buy this work of art right away, because every second looking at them, it's a second longer that you're away from Hollow Knight.

45,Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"REALLY LOVE THIS GAME <3 I came to know about this game because i first played Ori and Blind Forest and thought they were similar in concept, but this game is amazing and unique in its own away, i love the story, the characters, the gameplay and especially the art style! Before i played Hollow Knight i never was a person who would play games that have tons of boss fights (i even tend to avoid them as much as possible) but HK really opened up my eyes to the joy of taking on a boss, even though it would frustrate me to have to walk the long ass distance from the last bench to where i died especially when there were platforming challenges or tough enemies to get to my shade and hopefully not die, i always felt super happy when i finally beat a boss and get whatever reward for defeating the boss. As of this review i am only at 94% completion so i am still gonna finish all the other content that i haven't touched yet like godmaster and grimm troupe, both of which i am looking foward to completing :D Im so gonna get Silk Song when it comes out.

this right here is not a game but instead a masterpiece, something that the average human brain can not understand this is something that only the mightiest of the mightiest could ever desire.

jokes aside, i think Hollow Knight was one of (if not THE) most incredible experiences i've had with a game. the perfect mix between Metroidvania and Souls-Like. If i were to list every single aspect that i loved in this game i would be writing this for hours, but i have to give imense props to the story and sound design, never been so proud of buying a soundtrack bundle as i was with this game's. this is truly a game that i've fell completely in love, and am willing to come back to it later for the 120%.

Haven't revisited it to get the achievements, and I've never been interested in speedrunning of any kind. When I have time to game, it's usually with my friends, or I really hunker down and consume a single player game out of the many yet untouched in my library. I love a good story, and I miss the days when responsibilities were few and I could spend as much time as I could imagine just taking in every moment of every game that I felt like. Despite these things, I imagine one day when my hands don't work as well as they did when I was young, and responsibilities become fewer again, and time is still precious but the days empty, I will play Hollow Knight again. And I'll play it the way I did the first time. Slow, without any goals in mind, heights to reach, or anything of the sort. I'll play it again just to experience it again, because in all my years of playing across every console generation from all 3 brands from NES to the current gen and PC for nearly 30 years, likely approaching the completion of 1000 different video games, Hollow Knight is my indisputable favorite.",367520
45,Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,Not for everyone since it's full of bugs :),367520
45,Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"Hollow Knight is a deeply moody game that sits on the threshhold of souls-like and metroidvania, taking aspects from both genres into one game. It is also a game that has no desire to hold back punches, and gets remarkably difficult in some of its optional content, demanding a level of mastery from the player in both platforming and combat. If you're looking for an 'easy' game, or a game that guides you in any degree beyond dialogues and looking at a map, then Hollow Knight is not for you.

Hollow Knight places you in the shows of a little bug, running around with a sword in a lost bug-kingdom. Soon, you get caught up in the goings on of that ancient place, as it falls to the grips of the ""Corruption"", a glowing, ghostly alien orange light that seems to infect bugs and turn them into insane, mindless creatures, but also offering them incredible strength. A taller beetle named Hornet becomes your sometimes-guide, sometimes rival through the area, along with other NPCs you'll come across. It's again, very similar to seeing the different NPCs throughout the Dark Souls game, and the comparisons come easy and often. You learn about the story in small cutscenes, snippets of dialogue, and item descriptions - something which likely sounds familiar by now.

The game has you roaming around the world, and swiftly gives you access to fast travel, and equipment to make traversing the world easier. Over time, you'll get access to double jumps, wall climbing, dashes, and more, giving you very swift movement throughout the world - though as always, backtracking will be happening, especially for those looking for high percentage clears. Combat is fast, and enemies generally have 0 i-frames whatsoever, meaning combat can be as greedy as you want it to be - something which will quickly get you kiled against the game's many bosses. Various battle techniques will become apparent, such as using your sword in the air to ""pogo"" off of enemies and spikes to bounce endlessly off their heads, or off of the spikes. This technique becomes mandatory later on for some content, so learn it early and use it constantly. Magic is very powerful, and I found great success using equipment (""Charms"") that boosted my magic power early on, later transitioning into a pure sword (""Nail"") focused build for very rapid, long range melee attacks.

The music and sound effects are wonderful, especially in the Deepnest, a downright spooky and spine-tingling area of the game. While jump scares aren't built into the game, there are several points where the game works to make your skin crawl - but just as many other places where it wants you to admire an ancient kingdom, deep, deep underground, covered in dust but in many ways unharmed by time. Every area ha a color pallette unique to it, and area transitions are readily identifiable - at all times the player is alwys perfectly aware of where they are, and how areas connect to each other, which is critical for a metroidvania. It's also doubly crucial, as seeing where you are on the minimap actually requires you to use a Charm equipment slot, which you can only do at a bench/""Bonfire"". This is a controversial decision, and I'll openly admit I spent the vast majority of the game with it equipped to make my life easier.

There is a very large amount of sequence breaking that can occur throughout the game. It is wildly open even from the very start, and openly welcomes attempts to circumvent its usual progression. For those who play metroidvanias to do things like that, as long as you've got the skill and guts to pull it off, Hollow Knight is willing to accomodate. There is also a vast amount of optional content in the game, both story related, and non-main story, in the form of several DLCs, including boss rushes, and an entire side story about a mysterious carnival. The game also commits my least favorite thing about metroidvanias, which is ""invisible walls with nothing around to point out that you can walk through them"", so be ready to press against walls from time to time, looking for side entries and special hidden areas.

I would recommend Hollow Knight to anyone looking for a thoughtful, and challenging Metroidvania, especially for anyone who is willing to put in the time to do all of the optional and extra content - there is a wealth of things to accomplish and see, and it'd be a shame to leave it half done.",367520

45,Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game.

I've sunk 30 hours into it already and still only have a 70% completion score.
The problem is, only about 10 of those hours or so were actually spent exploring new areas, fighting new bosses, learning new skills... you know, the fun stuff.

The majority of your playtime in this game is going to be backtracking. And I get it, it's a Metroidvania. But this is too much. Too unclear. Too many dead-ends. You check your map and see there were fifteen paths where an obstacle blocked you, but there's no way you're going to remember what exactly each obstacle was. So when you FINALLY stumble upon a new ability, you have to recheck all your old obstructions, one-by-one. Powerups/other useful items are given way too infrequently. Even after 30 hours of gameplay, the story is still pretty cryptic.

Basically there's too much backtracking. My sense of direction in games may not be the best but come on. The majority of your gameplay shouldn't be wandering through the same areas swatting the same mooks you've had to encounter one hundred million times over and over and over again.

The actual gameplay (when you're actually encountering something new, that is) is amazing and crisp. I absolutely adore the art style and aesthetic. The combat is tight and strategic, frantic, and exciting. So much to love about this game. But God, so much to hate also.

I recommend keeping a detailed map open in MS paint where you can fill in notes along the way to help you remember certain obstacles. Or just use a walkthrough. Because fuuuuccccckkkk all this backtracking.",367520

45,Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"After playing this game for 105 hours, I realized something... I am the Hollow Knight...
I started playing this so much to the point that going beyond extremely difficult bosses made me empty inside, I have no more desires and no emotions while playing this because it's like I suffered long term hypnosis and didn't realize that I spent every afternoon of my week playing again... and again... and again...
It took me a long time to decide to write a review about this game, but I can't blame myself for that, as I was too busy getting hooked on it to remember to do anything else important in my life.
I spent days forgetting to eat lunch while playing this wonder, and after Hollow Knight became my favorite game, I realized it's a path of no return... but not a path of pain like the one in the game, but a path of emotion and happiness, and that's why you should stop looking at the reviews and buy this work of art right away, because every second looking at them, it's a second longer that you're away from Hollow Knight.

45,Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"REALLY LOVE THIS GAME <3 I came to know about this game because i first played Ori and Blind Forest and thought they were similar in concept, but this game is amazing and unique in its own away, i love the story, the characters, the gameplay and especially the art style! Before i played Hollow Knight i never was a person who would play games that have tons of boss fights (i even tend to avoid them as much as possible) but HK really opened up my eyes to the joy of taking on a boss, even though it would frustrate me to have to walk the long ass distance from the last bench to where i died especially when there were platforming challenges or tough enemies to get to my shade and hopefully not die, i always felt super happy when i finally beat a boss and get whatever reward for defeating the boss. As of this review i am only at 94% completion so i am still gonna finish all the other content that i haven't touched yet like godmaster and grimm troupe, both of which i am looking foward to completing :D Im so gonna get Silk Song when it comes out. ALSO CAN I JUST SAY I LOVE THE WHOLE GAME'S SOUNDTRACK KTHXBYE",367520
45,Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"yes, yes, yes YES a thousand times yes. 
this right here is not a game but instead a masterpiece, something that the average human brain can not understand this is something that only the mightiest of the mightiest could ever desire.

jokes aside, i think Hollow Knight was one of (if not THE) most incredible experiences i've had with a game. the perfect mix between Metroidvania and Souls-Like. If i were to list every single aspect that i loved in this game i would be writing this for hours, but i have to give imense props to the story and sound design, never been so proud of buying a soundtrack bundle as i was with this game's. this is truly a game that i've fell completely in love, and am willing to come back to it later for the 120%.

45,Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"I feel old now. Not enough time to play the games I want to play to the extent I want to play them. I haven't sat down and really enjoyed Hollow Knight in a long time. Haven't revisited it to get the achievements, and I've never been interested in speedrunning of any kind. When I have time to game, it's usually with my friends, or I really hunker down and consume a single player game out of the many yet untouched in my library. I love a good story, and I miss the days when responsibilities were few and I could spend as much time as I could imagine just taking in every moment of every game that I felt like. Despite these things, I imagine one day when my hands don't work as well as they did when I was young, and responsibilities become fewer again, and time is still precious but the days empty, I will play Hollow Knight again. And I'll play it the way I did the first time. Slow, without any goals in mind, heights to reach, or anything of the sort. I'll play it again just to experience it again, because in all my years of playing across every console generation from all 3 brands from NES to the current gen and PC for nearly 30 years, likely approaching the completion of 1000 different video games, Hollow Knight is my indisputable favorite.",367520
45,Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,Not for everyone since it's full of bugs :),367520
45,Hollow Knight,Indie,367520,"Hollow Knight is a deeply moody game that sits on the threshhold of souls-like and metroidvania, taking aspects from both genres into one game. It is also a game that has no desire to hold back punches, and gets remarkably difficult in some of its optional content, demanding a level of mastery from the player in both platforming and combat. If you're looking for an 'easy' game, or a game that guides you in any degree beyond dialogues and looking at a map, then Hollow Knight is not for you.

Hollow Knight places you in the shows of a little bug, running around with a sword in a lost bug-kingdom. Soon, you get caught up in the goings on of that ancient place, as it falls to the grips of the ""Corruption"", a glowing, ghostly alien orange light that seems to infect bugs and turn them into insane, mindless creatures, but also offering them incredible strength. A taller beetle named Hornet becomes your sometimes-guide, sometimes rival through the area, along with other NPCs you'll come across. It's again, very similar to seeing the different NPCs throughout the Dark Souls game, and the comparisons come easy and often. You learn about the story in small cutscenes, snippets of dialogue, and item descriptions - something which likely sounds familiar by now.

The game has you roaming around the world, and swiftly gives you access to fast travel, and equipment to make traversing the world easier. Over time, you'll get access to double jumps, wall climbing, dashes, and more, giving you very swift movement throughout the world - though as always, backtracking will be happening, especially for those looking for high percentage clears. Combat is fast, and enemies generally have 0 i-frames whatsoever, meaning combat can be as greedy as you want it to be - something which will quickly get you kiled against the game's many bosses. Various battle techniques will become apparent, such as using your sword in the air to ""pogo"" off of enemies and spikes to bounce endlessly off their heads, or off of the spikes. This technique becomes mandatory later on for some content, so learn it early and use it constantly. Magic is very powerful, and I found great success using equipment (""Charms"") that boosted my magic power early on, later transitioning into a pure sword (""Nail"") focused build for very rapid, long range melee attacks.

The music and sound effects are wonderful, especially in the Deepnest, a downright spooky and spine-tingling area of the game. While jump scares aren't built into the game, there are several points where the game works to make your skin crawl - but just as many other places where it wants you to admire an ancient kingdom, deep, deep underground, covered in dust but in many ways unharmed by time.

Memes, a flower that is a jerkwad arsehole, pixel graphics, and a sitcom-like feel.
It's also easy to get smashed by enemies, especially in certain situations.


Standard review:
I've not really ever played a game quite like this, so I've not really much to compare it to, but if Seinfeld (or similar) were made into an RPG, it would be something like this. It's meant to seem more comedic than dark and serious, and it pulls that off very well, even if there are some elements that are not clearly explained and/or can be figured out easily.

The battle mechanics are quite unique; I've never encountered any other system like it. Being able to spare one's opponent is actually a nice touch, though it never works right off the bat, apparently. There's also the defense system, which for me, is one of those things I'm fond of, but I'd improve upon in a couple ways:

1) Larger box for multiple enemies (since they all attack at once and it really makes it difficult to avoid attacks at times)
2) More chances for healing when being kind/merciful (often times one grabs the green only to get hit for more damage than what was healed and that's just bad-especially at 20 MAX HP)

The different soul/heart types are neat and those I'd not alter in any way, but DAMN, are you SLOW as MOLASSES when you do platforming (blue). Caused me to overestimate many of my jumps. Eh, nitpicky.

Ah, yes, the main character. Very ambiguous, kinda reminds me of another novella main character I love, only much cuter and far more benign on the surface (nothing is said about their past before the trip down into Mt. Ebott)...and the fact that everyone refers to the main character as they/them is a really good idea considering the main character is the 'silent protagonist' type (is there really a protagonist here?).

What name did I give the main character? 'Jess'. Not sure why you actually care, but yeah.

There's a lot more I could say, but it would be considered prattling.

So, play it. It's worth getting. Worth the frustration, worth Flowey's condescending and very inaccurate wisdom.",391540

Is there any way I can just totally disable updates on steam for beat saber? I don't care what fancy new features they want to add. I just want to hit blocks with my mods enabled.

This horrible update just made over night, and lots of people are reporting crashes.
 
My case, game actually got started, but every single click I made, I saw steam VR idle background every time.
Beat Saber was running so slow, and my eyes were getting tired by switching scenes.

Every update so far, I didn't like it much, yet I could bare few days till the mode gets updated.
However, this time I couldn't wait. I mean, the mode couldn't fix the fundamental problem with loading and switching scenes between in game and steam VR loading scenes. I spent few hours to downgrade, and I went back to 1.15, I am so satisfied with this downgrade.

Great works Beat Saber Team, you guys motivated me to downgrade this game.

I know the devs are just trying to improve the game, but it's insulting that they periodically break the game and all the mods and don't even offer a ""betas"" option on steam so I can avoid updates until all hot fixes are in and mod support is ready.

Is there any way I can just totally disable updates on steam for beat saber? I don't care what fancy new features they want to add. I just want to hit blocks with my mods enabled.

51,Grimm,Indie,252150,"For me, this game is a guilty pleasure. It's not the best or complex game but its a fine casual game for those who enjoy games where you grow more powerful and warp the world around you.

The concept of returning to classic tales to their gritty roots is a fun concept and it's great seeing the world twist around you. It's like playing De Blob or Katamari Damacy but with lower stakes. It's amusing to see the contrast as Grimm corrupts each story but the novelty wears off after awhile. The few platforming sections aren't that great but the levels do offer plenty of variety.

Overall, I think this game is okay and worth at least playing the demo. It offers plenty of content but it can feel monotonous at times.",252150

But I guess I'll start with the fact that I've played and loved many games of varying genres over the years, but this is the first time I've taken a moment to actually write a review on one. This game was just THAT good and carried so much meaning. I can't stop thinking about it. I know some people complain about ""the lack of game play"" and state that ""the puzzles are too easy, and they get bored without more of a challenge"" ... fine. But personally, I can't relate because when I dive into a visual novel, I expect an immersive story and to FEEL things above everything else, and that's exactly what I got from this game. 

If you love a unique, overwhelmingly beautiful, poetic, joyful, sad, even at times twisted and haunting, but still emotionally rewarding and heartwarming story: don't hesitate.
The dialogue was well written, bringing humor and bits of romance into a tragedy and time of death. I not only fell in love with several quotes and beautiful scenes from this story, but also spent about an hour or so crying at the end of it. Not sure if it was from sadness, or joy, or a combination of both.. but this story made me reflect on life in a deep way and left me wanting more. 
The added dlc episodes were simple but great too and I'm now about to play the follow up ""finding paradise"" and I'm really hopeful that I'll feel even half of what I felt from playing To the Moon.

To make a long story short: if you are a human with empathy and feelings, and just want a relaxing visual novel game that you can play to take a break from your busy life or whatever chaotic combat-heavy games you usually find yourself playing: this is it. Relax, soak it in, embrace it, and feel the emotions. It's kind of therapeutic, really.

I found the game play to be fairly repetitive. While I appreciate the mini games when going back through the memories, they lost their charm after the 4th or 5th one.

55,The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"So, this is going to be a bit long but I'll try to break things up in to categories for those that even care to read.
[h1] Pros: [/h1] 
1) I paid $8 for the game on sale a while back. I've played almost 300 hours.
2) Said $8 buys you a fair number of zones to explore, all of which scale to your character level - go anywhere, do anything, right from the start.
3) The community is usually friendly and helpful. You meet the occasional troll, they become more common as you explore further from starting areas, but more or less people are willing to provide helpful information if you ask in zone chat which is more than can be said about several other MMO's I've played.

[h1] Cons [/h1] 
1) [b] Crafting: [/b]
   I've played almost 300 hours but have accomplished almost nothing in game. I can't even craft a suit of what is considered ENTRY level armor having reached max level. With research speed maxed out it still takes around 12 real world days to research one piece of gear enough to craft a set item, you can research three items at once (with max research) and there are nine slots to fill for an ""entry"" level build to start powering up towards ""end game"" content. This means roughly 36 real life days of time must pass (likely more, as research may finish while you sleep, etc) to make your own stuff.

You also can't craft, research, or disassemble jewelry unless you buy the Summerset Chapter, or pay for ESO+ which leads me to my next topic.

Oh, and if you instead want to try and buy gear (which is insanely expensive to those starting out) there is no centralized market or Auction House. Instead you have individual Guild Traders that will let you browse items posted by the members of that Guild. This can be anything in game that isn't Bound to your character or account. With hundreds of Traders, that can have pretty much any item under the sun, spread out across all the zones in the game you have to rely on third party websites and addons to search for items that may or may not still be present by the time you travel to whichever zone and town that Guild Trader is in. It turns what should be a three minute shopping trip in to a three hour struggle.

2) [b] Monetization: [/b]
    I'm all for folks getting paid for their work, however publishers tend to push that to the extremes for the sake of their share holders. Monetization in this game feels scummy, bordering on predatory. You want to increase the speed of your mount, how much your mount can help you carry, or how long it can run? Great! Wait 3,600 real life hours (150 days, if you don't miss a single minute of upgrade time, but more realistically 180 days) to reach max attributes or pay real world currency (RWC) for instant upgrades. 

You want to hold all those crafting ingredients so you can (attempt to) make things? Great! Pay for ESO+ so you have access to a crafting storage bag, or constantly be throwing things away as character bag space is limited to 60 slots to start, upgraded with a non-inconsequential amount of gold or (you guessed it!) RWC to 140 slots which sounds like a lot, but for Provisioning (making foods and drinks) alone there are 50 different ingredients. Say you buy the first six bag upgrades to save 2/3rd the gold cost, you'd still spend 2,000 Crowns (~$20 USD) PER CHARACTER to upgrade your bags the last two ranks.

The list goes on but the worst of all (in my opinion) Crown Crates - loot boxes which provide random items upon opening. To make it even more enjoyable those Crown Crate items can be scrapped in to an alternate currency, only obtainable (to my knowledge) by opening Crates, which are used for purchasing other items from the in-game store. Granted, I haven't delved too deeply in to that aspect of things as I do not have any desire to waste money on in-game gambling for pixels but to lock things behind a currency that requires you to gamble seems rapacious.

3) [b] Repetative: [/b]
   Yes, it's an MMO so it's mostly what you make of it however each of your characters has to go through the same Public Dungeons, Delves, Quests, and Zones. Delves, Dungeons and Zone exploration are essentially required to collect Sky Shards which award extra Skill Points (used to learn combat or crafting skills) outside of the Skill points you receive while leveling. You get 64 Skill Points in total by the time you reach level 50 (max character level) however crafting skills alone can require well over 100 Points (ignoring some of the traits I find less useful) meaning you will spend hours and hours grinding. But hey, once you collect all the Sky Shards from a zone you can use RWC to buy those same shard unlocks on an alt to save time. It'll only cost you $5 per zone you've already cleared and with a dozen or so major zones only $60 per character. Yay?

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]
All in all, for $8 it's not a bad game though it does feel like any old generic MMO with an Elder Scrolls skin stretched over top of it. I personally refuse to spend a single penny more on anything else related to this game even though ESO+ feels almost mandatory (+10% gold, XP gains, crafting progression and research, double bank storage space, the ability to actually customize your armor appearance, and more) if you want to actually play without dipping in to your bag every 5 minutes to make space. I am however going to leave this as a negative review as their monetization offends me to such a degree that an otherwise okay game can not be something I recommend to others wholeheartedly but you can't go wrong for $8.

55,The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"ESO is a fantastic MMO. The community is great, and the game is just stunning. I am an old WOW player from the vanilla days and I remember just going to hilltops or on top of buildings and being in aw of the graphics. I get that feeling again in ESO. Sometimes I just watch the sun set over the water while casting a line in the water. here are some bullet points of why i love ESO.

- use any weapon you want. You want to be a greatsword wielding mage with light armor pants but a heavy helm? ok. sure. you want to craft EVERYTHING? ok. You can get all the crafting lines!
-such a pretty game as I said above. A well put together world 
-quests are not boring like go and kill 20 murlocs. There is always a neat story of why you are doing things, and its never just go kill mobs of X monsters. I spent a while last night just pickpocketing people and running from the law to get into the thieves guild. then I killed some people for the assassins' guild. want to just read books? go to a bookshelf and open one up! 
-LORE. lots of lovely LORE
- mostly free. People that complain about expansions costing money don't know how the world works. You can play this game (besides the actual game cost) for free. there is no real need for paying the month script fees unless you want to get cosmetic items for your or your house. BUT that being said, its a great deal if you want to get levels faster, and you get some crowns thrown in for that sweet sweet flaming dog mount. But, you get a free horse that goes just as fast, so again, you don't have to spend money. 
- you can solo. I am a solo player mostly. I am old and not good at video games, but that's ok. Its not a hard game to play, and most content is solo-able. I will eventually try to join a guild, but I am a filthy casual. dungeon finders work well and I never think I am missing something.

55,The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"TESO did not come up with anything radically new and actually just dusted off the familiar mechanics of the MMO genre. But it offers them in a greatly improved coat of an otherwise traditional concept and, of course, in the popular world of Tamriel. For some it may be little, for others a sufficient reason to pay monthly fees and have fun.

Jailbreaking and knowing that you have a higher goal is a big cliché in itself. What kind of chosen hero are you when you see dozens of similarly chosen people passing by? In previous The Elder Scrolls games, this model was accepted because it was a singleplayer game. But online with hundreds of thousands of players? And they are all chosen.

Tamriel and his states create the impression of pomp, but later you find out that a large area also suffers from inner emptiness. To some extent, this is due to a graphic concept that lacks the hallmark of originality. The world around is desperately monotonous over time. What bothered me the most was when I came to a town or settlement and found that it looked exactly like the previous one. However, I would expect some specific landmarks or architectural differences - in short, more interesting ideas.

The Elder Scrolls Online is an above-average game, but it expects a great deal of enthusiasm from man for the TES series, world and realities. The better you know Tamriel, the more you will enjoy it. Be sure to try the game, provided you don't normally play much online games or you're a big fan of The Elder Scrolls. I will definitely come back to TESO to see what the updates have done with the game. [b] 70% [/b]",306130

55,The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"This game is amazing.
World doesn't get old like in other MMORPG's, so questing and exploring is always relevant and rewarding. Endgame is challenging, but it comes without pressure to do it in a haste. Expansions expand the game, but without forcing players out of older zones and content. I'm having the most fun I had in a while. Subscription is optional, and there is so much gameplay freedom.
I wish I had started playing it sooner.

Sells your personal info to anyone with the cash, including: ""username, name, demographics and other characteristics or descriptions, email, address, telephone number, and other contact information, account credentials, communications preferences, billing and payment information"".

 Change the privacy policy if you want a positive review, and also give me some compensation for this breach of trust (not a refund, actual COMPENSATION for copy and pasting my personal details all over the internet). Pretty annoyed that I paid for this, for you to later decide it wasn't enough and try to get that extra cash out of my personal details too.",306130
55,The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"Loved the ending! Reading other reviews some folks complain about the monthly pass price though, largely senior citizens it seems. I stand with them, the pricing model is unfair. For that I have to leave a harsh but fair thumbs down.",306130
55,The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"The blatant greed in this game is getting much worse. I'm fine with buying cosmetics, but they keep hiding them in loot boxes and consistently lowering drop rates, not to mention splitting cosmetic armor into pieces so you have to keep buying to get the whole set. Want to bank on the go? That's $50. Want to buy a house so you can put all those cosmetic items somewhere? $50 to $150 for anything worth buying. Not to mention the subscription of $180 a year without buying the $60 expansion. If you plan on playing for any decent amount of time, the subscription is definitely required, otherwise you lose half your bank space and the crafting bag which is infinite.

Look, love this game and the community, but ZOS is a terrible company who only wants your money. They don't listen to the community and keep jacking up the prices. I only hope Microsoft can fix the mess they've created",306130

Via account ban.

So after 85 minutes of gameplay I had a single 2-level character in a starting zone with something like 20-26 coins and a bag full of loot, with no guild, no friends, no mail, no chat messages. Not a lot of progress, but hey -- I love to explore a game world, so I spent time crawling into every possible corner of a starting zone (and looting everything around, that's Elder Scrolls after all).
I decided that I like the game, purchaced another copy as a gift for my sister (so we can loot twice more!) and happily turned off my PC and went asleep.
Now, time for magic! I don't remember having a habit of sleepwalking (or sleepgaming). But according to the email I've received from TESO support next morning, they've caught me selling the gold during that night. I've requested them to provide any evidence (I am really into it, because I don't even know how to sell gold -- never thought of it), but received no response.
So... If you are planning for any long-term play, I can not recommend this game.",306130

55,The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"The game is decent, plenty of interesting dungeons and the combat is better than a few other MMOs i've played.

With that being said i just CAN'T reccomend this game from a collector's point of view. 
If you're expecting to collect plenty of mounts, weapons, minions ecc. you WILL be disappointed. 90% of the mounts are from the crown store, 90% of the pets are from the crown store. Of course, there are a few you can only get by playing, but simply put, they're all s**t compared to the paid ones, apart from a SINGLE mount that's decent looking, BUT, to get it you must do one of the hardest raids in the game! One. Decent. Mount.
Talking about raids, there ARE rewards for doing the end-game content, yes; what could it be? Mounts? Armor? Weapons? No no, you get some cosmetic that changes your character's skin texture. So if your character is fully armored (Like me) you might as well go f*** yourself.

The game has armor and styles, basically:
Armor is the stuff that gives you stats
Styles is what you use to make transmogs, basically consuming a style page unlocks that specific gear piece to be used for transmogs.
There are a few cool styles you can get from PVP, specifically the Xivkyn style. It's basically the Daedric armor from Skyrim, to give you an idea. To get these pages you must grind a lot, with the danger of an enemy player coming in to steal all your progress (You can only get the pages in a specific mode, but i won't be explaining it since it'd be too long), BUT, guess what?! You can just spend a few bucks and you'll get em instantly! Ain't that cool?
HELL, the only way to get a few good houses is to spend money! And i'm not talking about 20/30 bucks no, i'm talking about 90 f***ing dollars! For a digital house!

Do i have to say anything else?


Of course, you CAN get all of this for free if you have a Plus subscription, since you get a bit of crowns every month. Still, that doesn't change anything. Almost nothing in this game has any real value/rarity. I figured this after way too much time, so if you're a collector like me, don't make my mistake, play a better MMO.",306130

55,The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"So, this is going to be a bit long but I'll try to break things up in to categories for those that even care to read.
[h1] Pros: [/h1] 
1) I paid $8 for the game on sale a while back. I've played almost 300 hours.
2) Said $8 buys you a fair number of zones to explore, all of which scale to your character level - go anywhere, do anything, right from the start.
3) The community is usually friendly and helpful. You meet the occasional troll, they become more common as you explore further from starting areas, but more or less people are willing to provide helpful information if you ask in zone chat which is more than can be said about several other MMO's I've played.

[h1] Cons [/h1] 
1) [b] Crafting: [/b]
   I've played almost 300 hours but have accomplished almost nothing in game. I can't even craft a suit of what is considered ENTRY level armor having reached max level. With research speed maxed out it still takes around 12 real world days to research one piece of gear enough to craft a set item, you can research three items at once (with max research) and there are nine slots to fill for an ""entry"" level build to start powering up towards ""end game"" content. This means roughly 36 real life days of time must pass (likely more, as research may finish while you sleep, etc) to make your own stuff.

You also can't craft, research, or disassemble jewelry unless you buy the Summerset Chapter, or pay for ESO+ which leads me to my next topic.

Oh, and if you instead want to try and buy gear (which is insanely expensive to those starting out) there is no centralized market or Auction House. Instead you have individual Guild Traders that will let you browse items posted by the members of that Guild. This can be anything in game that isn't Bound to your character or account. With hundreds of Traders, that can have pretty much any item under the sun, spread out across all the zones in the game you have to rely on third party websites and addons to search for items that may or may not still be present by the time you travel to whichever zone and town that Guild Trader is in. It turns what should be a three minute shopping trip in to a three hour struggle.

2) [b] Monetization: [/b]
    I'm all for folks getting paid for their work, however publishers tend to push that to the extremes for the sake of their share holders. Monetization in this game feels scummy, bordering on predatory. You want to increase the speed of your mount, how much your mount can help you carry, or how long it can run? Great! Wait 3,600 real life hours (150 days, if you don't miss a single minute of upgrade time, but more realistically 180 days) to reach max attributes or pay real world currency (RWC) for instant upgrades. 

You want to hold all those crafting ingredients so you can (attempt to) make things? Great! Pay for ESO+ so you have access to a crafting storage bag, or constantly be throwing things away as character bag space is limited to 60 slots to start, upgraded with a non-inconsequential amount of gold or (you guessed it!) RWC to 140 slots which sounds like a lot, but for Provisioning (making foods and drinks) alone there are 50 different ingredients. Say you buy the first six bag upgrades to save 2/3rd the gold cost, you'd still spend 2,000 Crowns (~$20 USD) PER CHARACTER to upgrade your bags the last two ranks.

The list goes on but the worst of all (in my opinion) Crown Crates - loot boxes which provide random items upon opening. To make it even more enjoyable those Crown Crate items can be scrapped in to an alternate currency, only obtainable (to my knowledge) by opening Crates, which are used for purchasing other items from the in-game store. Granted, I haven't delved too deeply in to that aspect of things as I do not have any desire to waste money on in-game gambling for pixels but to lock things behind a currency that requires you to gamble seems rapacious.

3) [b] Repetative: [/b]
   Yes, it's an MMO so it's mostly what you make of it however each of your characters has to go through the same Public Dungeons, Delves, Quests, and Zones. Delves, Dungeons and Zone exploration are essentially required to collect Sky Shards which award extra Skill Points (used to learn combat or crafting skills) outside of the Skill points you receive while leveling. You get 64 Skill Points in total by the time you reach level 50 (max character level) however crafting skills alone can require well over 100 Points (ignoring some of the traits I find less useful) meaning you will spend hours and hours grinding. But hey, once you collect all the Sky Shards from a zone you can use RWC to buy those same shard unlocks on an alt to save time. It'll only cost you $5 per zone you've already cleared and with a dozen or so major zones only $60 per character. Yay?

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]
All in all, for $8 it's not a bad game though it does feel like any old generic MMO with an Elder Scrolls skin stretched over top of it. I personally refuse to spend a single penny more on anything else related to this game even though ESO+ feels almost mandatory (+10% gold, XP gains, crafting progression and research, double bank storage space, the ability to actually customize your armor appearance, and more) if you want to actually play without dipping in to your bag every 5 minutes to make space. I am however going to leave this as a negative review as their monetization offends me to such a degree that an otherwise okay game can not be something I recommend to others wholeheartedly but you can't go wrong for $8.

55,The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"ESO is a fantastic MMO. The community is great, and the game is just stunning. I am an old WOW player from the vanilla days and I remember just going to hilltops or on top of buildings and being in aw of the graphics. I get that feeling again in ESO. Sometimes I just watch the sun set over the water while casting a line in the water. here are some bullet points of why i love ESO.

- use any weapon you want. You want to be a greatsword wielding mage with light armor pants but a heavy helm? ok. sure. you want to craft EVERYTHING? ok. You can get all the crafting lines!
-such a pretty game as I said above. A well put together world 
-quests are not boring like go and kill 20 murlocs. There is always a neat story of why you are doing things, and its never just go kill mobs of X monsters. I spent a while last night just pickpocketing people and running from the law to get into the thieves guild. then I killed some people for the assassins' guild. want to just read books? go to a bookshelf and open one up! 
-LORE. lots of lovely LORE
- mostly free. People that complain about expansions costing money don't know how the world works. You can play this game (besides the actual game cost) for free. there is no real need for paying the month script fees unless you want to get cosmetic items for your or your house. BUT that being said, its a great deal if you want to get levels faster, and you get some crowns thrown in for that sweet sweet flaming dog mount. But, you get a free horse that goes just as fast, so again, you don't have to spend money. 
- you can solo. I am a solo player mostly. I am old and not good at video games, but that's ok. Its not a hard game to play, and most content is solo-able. I will eventually try to join a guild, but I am a filthy casual. dungeon finders work well and I never think I am missing something.

55,The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"TESO did not come up with anything radically new and actually just dusted off the familiar mechanics of the MMO genre. But it offers them in a greatly improved coat of an otherwise traditional concept and, of course, in the popular world of Tamriel. For some it may be little, for others a sufficient reason to pay monthly fees and have fun.

Jailbreaking and knowing that you have a higher goal is a big cliché in itself. What kind of chosen hero are you when you see dozens of similarly chosen people passing by? In previous The Elder Scrolls games, this model was accepted because it was a singleplayer game. But online with hundreds of thousands of players? And they are all chosen.

Tamriel and his states create the impression of pomp, but later you find out that a large area also suffers from inner emptiness. To some extent, this is due to a graphic concept that lacks the hallmark of originality. The world around is desperately monotonous over time. What bothered me the most was when I came to a town or settlement and found that it looked exactly like the previous one. However, I would expect some specific landmarks or architectural differences - in short, more interesting ideas.

The Elder Scrolls Online is an above-average game, but it expects a great deal of enthusiasm from man for the TES series, world and realities. The better you know Tamriel, the more you will enjoy it. Be sure to try the game, provided you don't normally play much online games or you're a big fan of The Elder Scrolls. I will definitely come back to TESO to see what the updates have done with the game. [b] 70% [/b]",306130

Not to mention the subscription of $180 a year without buying the $60 expansion. If you plan on playing for any decent amount of time, the subscription is definitely required, otherwise you lose half your bank space and the crafting bag which is infinite.

Via account ban.

So after 85 minutes of gameplay I had a single 2-level character in a starting zone with something like 20-26 coins and a bag full of loot, with no guild, no friends, no mail, no chat messages. Not a lot of progress, but hey -- I love to explore a game world, so I spent time crawling into every possible corner of a starting zone (and looting everything around, that's Elder Scrolls after all).
I decided that I like the game, purchaced another copy as a gift for my sister (so we can loot twice more!) and happily turned off my PC and went asleep.
Now, time for magic! I don't remember having a habit of sleepwalking (or sleepgaming). But according to the email I've received from TESO support next morning, they've caught me selling the gold during that night. I've requested them to provide any evidence (I am really into it, because I don't even know how to sell gold -- never thought of it), but received no response.

55,The Elder Scrolls® Online,RPG,306130,"The game is decent, plenty of interesting dungeons and the combat is better than a few other MMOs i've played.

With that being said i just CAN'T reccomend this game from a collector's point of view. 
If you're expecting to collect plenty of mounts, weapons, minions ecc. you WILL be disappointed. 90% of the mounts are from the crown store, 90% of the pets are from the crown store. Of course, there are a few you can only get by playing, but simply put, they're all s**t compared to the paid ones, apart from a SINGLE mount that's decent looking, BUT, to get it you must do one of the hardest raids in the game! One. Decent. Mount.
Talking about raids, there ARE rewards for doing the end-game content, yes; what could it be? Mounts? Armor? Weapons? No no, you get some cosmetic that changes your character's skin texture. So if your character is fully armored (Like me) you might as well go f*** yourself.

The game has armor and styles, basically:
Armor is the stuff that gives you stats
Styles is what you use to make transmogs, basically consuming a style page unlocks that specific gear piece to be used for transmogs.
There are a few cool styles you can get from PVP, specifically the Xivkyn style. It's basically the Daedric armor from Skyrim, to give you an idea. To get these pages you must grind a lot, with the danger of an enemy player coming in to steal all your progress (You can only get the pages in a specific mode, but i won't be explaining it since it'd be too long), BUT, guess what?! You can just spend a few bucks and you'll get em instantly! Ain't that cool?
HELL, the only way to get a few good houses is to spend money! And i'm not talking about 20/30 bucks no, i'm talking about 90 f***ing dollars! For a digital house!

Do i have to say anything else?


Of course, you CAN get all of this for free if you have a Plus subscription, since you get a bit of crowns every month. Still, that doesn't change anything.

Let me see. Today, this Friday night...I have been in a giant show which was excellently done with anime dancers. I climbed about a mile up in the sky with some people and then we dropped down. I have been in some sort of anime/game forest. I have been in a bowling alley which appeared very real, complete with 50s music and disco light :) I have been in a bar with about 20 people and a bar tender busy running around and serving drinks. I have been in an abandoned prison with scary ghosts, traps and all kinds of stuff. We have played games like CTF and we've been in an old Western town where we were the Sherrifs and shot some bad Bandit dudes :)

A lot of fun also with people showing off their insanely creative avatars. I took my headset off later on and realized that I ""experienced"" more things in one single night than a normal person could ever experience in ""real life"" in a night, uh..a week or a month even. This is just frickin' awesome beyond words.

From a technical point of view, the avatars are excellent and VRchat even allows making and importing your own from Unity. Lip sync, eye tracking and all. Some of the best avatars I have ever seen. The entire system seems polished and runs smooth.

VRChat must have hundreds of ""worlds"" including games etc. to choose from since you can browse them for an half an hour and still didn't see them all. This is crazy. Uh, that being said people can also design their own worlds and games and put them in there. Possibilites: Endless. MIND. BLOWN.

So far I've only tried two minigames (discs and wild west) and both of them were well designed, bug free and simply fun to play.

I have been in a bowling alley which appeared very real, complete with 50s music and disco light :) I have been in a bar with about 20 people and a bar tender busy running around and serving drinks. I have been in an abandoned prison with scary ghosts, traps and all kinds of stuff. We have played games like CTF and we've been in an old Western town where we were the Sherrifs and shot some bad Bandit dudes :)

A lot of fun also with people showing off their insanely creative avatars. I took my headset off later on and realized that I ""experienced"" more things in one single night than a normal person could ever experience in ""real life"" in a night, uh..a week or a month even. This is just frickin' awesome beyond words.

From a technical point of view, the avatars are excellent and VRchat even allows making and importing your own from Unity. Lip sync, eye tracking and all. Some of the best avatars I have ever seen. The entire system seems polished and runs smooth.

VRChat must have hundreds of ""worlds"" including games etc. to choose from since you can browse them for an half an hour and still didn't see them all. This is crazy. Uh, that being said people can also design their own worlds and games and put them in there. Possibilites: Endless. MIND. BLOWN.

And the people are ALL extremely friendly and supportive etc.

This is VR as good as it can get with TONS of fun and infinite things to do. Seriously it's mind-blowingly good.

VR Chat is the best social game which I've played in virtual reality. I've played it for well over an hour and already had lots of fun. The people I've met have been very welcoming and friendly. So far I've only tried two minigames (discs and wild west) and both of them were well designed, bug free and simply fun to play.

I've played a few other social games (e.g. Rec Room, AltSpaceVR) but VR Chat exceeds both those games in my mind. It just seems as if there's a more established community here and overall everything just seems better (e.g. the games).",438100
56,VRChat,Massively%20Multiplayer,438100,"This is the best application for virtual reality, hands down. I have been a member of VRchat for over two years, and the community is what makes this place so special. Each ""room"" in VRchat is a direct upload of a scene in Unity (software used to create most VR experiences). This makes it very easy for community members to upload new rooms and content. The developers of VRchat are also making the games they have (Capture the Flag, Battle Discs, etc) available in the SDK. This means over the next few months anyone can adapt these games and create new versions of them!

VRchat is a great way to gain exposure to Unity/development...but you can also just have fun and talk to others here. Other social VR apps don't even compare in that feeling of community you get when you log in. Our meetups are on Sundays, but since its public release there have been people logged in continuously. 

Come join our community, and see for yourself what makes this such a special place!",438100

Honestly you need to get in this game as fast and possible. The Devs treat you like a actual human, I say this meeting and personaly talking and hanging with them. I send nights just chilling with devs 1 on 1 or with others, There the best I have only meet VRPILL,Mechlaid,Kirito,Gunther, Somewhat Violet. There the best I got to say I'm telling you once you play this you won't ever need to play another game. Honestly I'm not plainning on playing anymore games or buying anyothers. Endless its series I play before that are coming out with new games cause memorys. I do have to say I'm only on desktop as of now, But even if I am I'm having loads of fun talking etc. A few things to note there updating the game constintly adding new things, Avatar Creation and World Creation very tricky and complcated I don't recommend you try to make one right away if you never dealt with, Unity,Belnder,Maya,Cinmea4D cause you will be very confused. Though there are videos online that can put your mind set in the right direction taking you someone step by step. But you could always ask staff,devs etc for help even people with avatars already, But keep in mind even if they have avatars they may or may not know hwo to help you. Its still pretty difficult to make one. But what really put this game on the top is its open source anything within the games rules is allowed I say ask the devs what your planning before doing so. The hub consintly being checked on , Also this is a E for everyone game so keep in mind its for kids also. So in the hub you got watch what your saying my first day in the game someone got banned for loads of not okay words to say if you get my drift.

2/18/2017 Edit: Some of my outfit/platoon mates gave me some ideas as to what to put for the 10 things as I could only think of about 4 on my own :P 
So thanks to them to make this review entirely possible!

3/1/2017 Edit 2: a few more tips for you are   
1) dont run infront of your allies that are shooting, go behind them so you stay out of their line of fire.   
2) use the terain around you for cover.  
3) if your a Heavy Assault turn you shield on when entering cover, even if your not being shot at. reason is this is a CLIENT side game if you can see them, you can shoot them. so if your in cover they may still see you out of cover for a short time after because they havent recieved the info from you yet. so use the addage of ""I can see you, I can shoot you"" the same goes for the other players aswell   
4) Don't go straight for the enemy UNLESS you have several teamates with you. Try your BEST to FLANK the enemy. don't attack them head on. come at them from the sides, above, or even behind them, if one tactic dosen't work... Try something else. the fight is dynamic, just like you!  5) Finally, LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of your weapons, it WILL take time.


P.S. Feel free to add my on steam or PS2 (ingame) the name i listed is my primary although if you want i can tell you the others via PM or steam chat.

P.P.S. I added some tips my teamates and friends gave me. some others on Youtube, like Wrel (Dev) Nico101, Joshino, and others have also said some of these tips. If you want to know more about the game look them up on youtube Especially Wrel, as he's a developer. Nico101 I'd recoment to Older audiences, as there is some ""Humor"" that younger audiences may find offensive or dont understand. (he and his team swear a bit aswell) i do squad ops with them and its mostly moments of WTF?! and general fun. Joshino and Wrel are a great choice to see if you want to Learn more about the game, its mechanics and also for general info/guides for weapons or tactics. 

Now all this is simply my PERSONAL opinion, while i agree that some others may not agree with me, i hold my opinions of the game and the players in fair judgment.

      Planetside 2 is an online tactical shooter in which you choose to be a soldier in one of three different factions that are involved in an eternal struggle for various planets.

Oh man, Planetside... Where do I even start with you?

Okay, let's start with the noticeable stuff first:
- The abyssmal performance:
The performance has been quite bad since launch. After years of patches, it still hasn't really gotten any better. The one trick they pulled was to label the old ""high"" settings to be the new ""ultra"" settings. I think you can see where this is going...
- The weapons:
A billion iterations of every weapon there is, with little to no differences between the guns themselves. Originally the factions were designed to have strengths and weaknesses. Now there are guns which every faction can use, which have no apparent weakness.
- The lags:
Oh god, the lags. Dying behind corners is pretty normal here. Also, other forms of glitching around, bad pop-in (like literally other players popping in 2 metres in front of you... yes, enemies aswell)

I could list several additional problems this game has, but I'm just tired. There is no hope here,

57,PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"#Pros and cons#
Epic, unique, one of a kind. It's 2017 and still no game like this one.
A war, vast worlds, playground, massive battles (and also opposite), variety, tactical, outstanding.
A war, free2play but no child's playground.
Well in a chaotic massive battle everyone could find his role and spot......
Teamwork, lone wolf, support, scout, infiltrator, cloaked bugger, jetpack flank warrior, mechwarrior, tank force, air force, gatherer...
Unforgiving, complex and overcomplicated.
Outstanding deep ballistics.

Very very slow progress to unlock this and upgrade that, add these and fully uncap those. 
Grind or die, grind to win, play or pay. 
Anyway time is money. Free2play can turn into the most expensive game by far, by far. No respecs, no refunds.
Brainer. One way or another?
Yea, teamwork, leadership and tactics, that's what matters, 
well you will be facing the most equipped warriors and platoons over n over, also you will be swarmed...,
and well the factions and powers are kinda unbalanced and varied on purpose here and there, 
so you will be facing some OP sh1t over n over. A war.
Well yea mostly everything has a downside. Challenge, outsmart, tactics.
One faction population decrease, the faction can be outnumbered. A swarm. Depending on server, can happen often.
Limited numbers, sometimes queues to one world. At least playing underpopulated faction kinda prevents you from queues. Membership has priority. 

#Honorable mentions#
CPU demanding (average GPU is enough).
Dont expect 120+++ FPS, stable FPS
Beside ingame, you can edit config file for performance, visual clarity, FOV, etc.
Stuck in queue? Just try reenter the queue or ""Join Combat"" button every 1-2mins, should help.",218230
57,PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"I think anyone who likes multiplayer FPS games should at the very least try out Planetside 2. This is a very special experience, I can’t think of another FPS that is as ambitious, varied, and outrageous in its dedication to all out chaotic war as this game. Thousands, and I mean thousands of real people at sitting at their computers all across the world battle in this never ending sci fi conflict from a first person perspective, all in glorious real time, and for the most part, it works. It’s astonishing to stare across a field at a giant group of advancing enemy infantry, easily larger than even the largest Battlefield server, snap to iron sights, and fire into the group and score a kill, only to get run over from behind by one of a hundred tanks cresting over the hill, firing in all directions like maniacs. The game is an MMO, but just the very fact that it still manages to feel like a standard FPS with decent controls and shooting mechanics is a grand achievement. Planetside 2 feels, at times, like the perfect game I wanted as a little kid while going “pew pew” with dozens of little plastic army men.

Like other MMOs, you can join an outfit (guild) and fight for one of three distinct factions. The scary red space communists (guns are weak but shoot fast), the freedom loving space Americans (guns are strong but shoot slow), and the spiritual xenophile space hippies (laser guns). These factions are engaged in an eternal conflict over several continents, and the game centers around various control points. Choose a class ranging from the vital medic to the jetpacking Light Assault and help out your team crush the enemy forces. The size of each continent is mind boggling, and while large stretches are usually unused for long periods of time, it is easy to find conflict zones and jump straight in by the game’s intuitive map system. See all of those flashing booms? Shit’s going down there, get in the meat grinder, soldier!

The land and air vehicles are easy to operate, and the infantry controls are familiar if you’ve played any recent FPS. There is a ton of variety in how the gameplay unfolds. One minute you are firing at distant targets in a barren desert from a tank’s turret, the next you could be dropped from a hovering Galaxy troop carrier into the thick of an intense CQB firefight. However, there are definitely long boring stretches of inactivity like in other MMOs, boring car rides or endless sprints to the objective that can become pretty grating over time. Thankfully, you can always kill yourself to respawn somewhere closer, or spawn on a mobile spawn truck known as the Sunderer, so if you’re an impatient type action is never too far away.

The game unfortunately isn’t perfect. Performance is all over the place, despite having a good system expect things to slow down in some of the more hectic combat moments, which is expected since the game is trying to render hundreds of people shooting each other. The F2P system isn’t too bad, the starting guns are definitely viable in combat, but in order to get another weapon or even to unlock a new attachment can feel very grindy at times. Players who spend a ton of money will definitely have an advantage over you in a 1v1 situation since they have access to more gadgets, scopes, etc. than you do, but since the battles are so chaotic and packed with people, this is rarely an issue. 

Planetside 2 is an ambitious game that truly makes you feel like you are a small cog in a giant sci fi battle. I feel as if many multiplayer FPS games are becoming more and more obsessed with making every player feel like a cool guy special forces operator, but Planetside 2 basically says, “You don’t matter, you’re one of hundreds of dumb grunts running around and you are most likely going to die real quick.” I really enjoy this and I wished more developers would work towards making a similar MMOFPS like this of our dreams. Imagine an MMOFPS set in Europe during WW2 (Not that Heroes and Generals shits), now that would be something I really like. Imagine Allied forces landing in player controlled LCVPs, while Axis Luftwafe strafe the beaches, and Panzer divisions massing for a counter attack. Now THAT's my dream video game. 

Planetside 2 is definitely worth trying out, it’s free, so why not?",218230

57,PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This is one of the most difficult FPS games I've ever played simply because of the sheer number or people who can end up shooting at you because of the smallest mistakes... This game puts the OP in ""Teamwork OP"" because a well oiled outfit that has its tactics down can storm a base and turn the tide of a battle even when outnumbered. This game is not pay 2 win but it WILL require you to grind to acquire the gear you want if you're not interested in investing some money for DB cash. There are many class unlocks that cannot be bought and must be earned. 

At this point of the game (like 4 years running now) there are many vets on both sides with lots of gear/weapons unlocked and it can seem daunting for a new player. However the unlockable weapons tend to be sidegrades rather than an outright upgrade, meaning that the stats of the new weapon won't necessarily be better than the last but it may be better for different circumstances i.e. CQC, or Long/mid range fights. Each weapon excels in its own area.

I Believe there is even an xp bonus for soldiers under BR (Battle Rank) 15 to help you get some quick Cert points. I suggest medic for new players as you can earn a TON of xp without having to kill anyone and medics are SUPER useful in big or small fights.",218230

57,PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"#Pros and cons#
Epic, unique, one of a kind. It's 2017 and still no game like this one.
A war, vast worlds, playground, massive battles (and also opposite), variety, tactical, outstanding.
A war, free2play but no child's playground.
Well in a chaotic massive battle everyone could find his role and spot......
Teamwork, lone wolf, support, scout, infiltrator, cloaked bugger, jetpack flank warrior, mechwarrior, tank force, air force, gatherer...
Unforgiving, complex and overcomplicated.
Outstanding deep ballistics.

Very very slow progress to unlock this and upgrade that, add these and fully uncap those. 
Grind or die, grind to win, play or pay. 
Anyway time is money. Free2play can turn into the most expensive game by far, by far. No respecs, no refunds.
Brainer. One way or another?
Yea, teamwork, leadership and tactics, that's what matters, 
well you will be facing the most equipped warriors and platoons over n over, also you will be swarmed...,
and well the factions and powers are kinda unbalanced and varied on purpose here and there, 
so you will be facing some OP sh1t over n over. A war.
Well yea mostly everything has a downside. Challenge, outsmart, tactics.
One faction population decrease, the faction can be outnumbered. A swarm. Depending on server, can happen often.
Limited numbers, sometimes queues to one world. At least playing underpopulated faction kinda prevents you from queues. Membership has priority. 

#Honorable mentions#
CPU demanding (average GPU is enough).
Dont expect 120+++ FPS, stable FPS
Beside ingame, you can edit config file for performance, visual clarity, FOV, etc.
Stuck in queue? Just try reenter the queue or ""Join Combat"" button every 1-2mins, should help.",218230
57,PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"I think anyone who likes multiplayer FPS games should at the very least try out Planetside 2. This is a very special experience, I can’t think of another FPS that is as ambitious, varied, and outrageous in its dedication to all out chaotic war as this game. Thousands, and I mean thousands of real people at sitting at their computers all across the world battle in this never ending sci fi conflict from a first person perspective, all in glorious real time, and for the most part, it works. It’s astonishing to stare across a field at a giant group of advancing enemy infantry, easily larger than even the largest Battlefield server, snap to iron sights, and fire into the group and score a kill, only to get run over from behind by one of a hundred tanks cresting over the hill, firing in all directions like maniacs. The game is an MMO, but just the very fact that it still manages to feel like a standard FPS with decent controls and shooting mechanics is a grand achievement. Planetside 2 feels, at times, like the perfect game I wanted as a little kid while going “pew pew” with dozens of little plastic army men.

Like other MMOs, you can join an outfit (guild) and fight for one of three distinct factions. The scary red space communists (guns are weak but shoot fast), the freedom loving space Americans (guns are strong but shoot slow), and the spiritual xenophile space hippies (laser guns). These factions are engaged in an eternal conflict over several continents, and the game centers around various control points. Choose a class ranging from the vital medic to the jetpacking Light Assault and help out your team crush the enemy forces. The size of each continent is mind boggling, and while large stretches are usually unused for long periods of time, it is easy to find conflict zones and jump straight in by the game’s intuitive map system. See all of those flashing booms? Shit’s going down there, get in the meat grinder, soldier!

The land and air vehicles are easy to operate, and the infantry controls are familiar if you’ve played any recent FPS. There is a ton of variety in how the gameplay unfolds. One minute you are firing at distant targets in a barren desert from a tank’s turret, the next you could be dropped from a hovering Galaxy troop carrier into the thick of an intense CQB firefight. However, there are definitely long boring stretches of inactivity like in other MMOs, boring car rides or endless sprints to the objective that can become pretty grating over time. Thankfully, you can always kill yourself to respawn somewhere closer, or spawn on a mobile spawn truck known as the Sunderer, so if you’re an impatient type action is never too far away.

The game unfortunately isn’t perfect. Performance is all over the place, despite having a good system expect things to slow down in some of the more hectic combat moments, which is expected since the game is trying to render hundreds of people shooting each other. The F2P system isn’t too bad, the starting guns are definitely viable in combat, but in order to get another weapon or even to unlock a new attachment can feel very grindy at times. Players who spend a ton of money will definitely have an advantage over you in a 1v1 situation since they have access to more gadgets, scopes, etc. than you do, but since the battles are so chaotic and packed with people, this is rarely an issue. 

Planetside 2 is an ambitious game that truly makes you feel like you are a small cog in a giant sci fi battle. I feel as if many multiplayer FPS games are becoming more and more obsessed with making every player feel like a cool guy special forces operator, but Planetside 2 basically says, “You don’t matter, you’re one of hundreds of dumb grunts running around and you are most likely going to die real quick.” I really enjoy this and I wished more developers would work towards making a similar MMOFPS like this of our dreams. Imagine an MMOFPS set in Europe during WW2 (Not that Heroes and Generals shits), now that would be something I really like. Imagine Allied forces landing in player controlled LCVPs, while Axis Luftwafe strafe the beaches, and Panzer divisions massing for a counter attack. Now THAT's my dream video game. 

Planetside 2 is definitely worth trying out, it’s free, so why not?",218230

57,PlanetSide 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,218230,"This is one of the most difficult FPS games I've ever played simply because of the sheer number or people who can end up shooting at you because of the smallest mistakes... This game puts the OP in ""Teamwork OP"" because a well oiled outfit that has its tactics down can storm a base and turn the tide of a battle even when outnumbered. This game is not pay 2 win but it WILL require you to grind to acquire the gear you want if you're not interested in investing some money for DB cash. There are many class unlocks that cannot be bought and must be earned. 

At this point of the game (like 4 years running now) there are many vets on both sides with lots of gear/weapons unlocked and it can seem daunting for a new player. However the unlockable weapons tend to be sidegrades rather than an outright upgrade, meaning that the stats of the new weapon won't necessarily be better than the last but it may be better for different circumstances i.e. CQC, or Long/mid range fights. Each weapon excels in its own area.

I Believe there is even an xp bonus for soldiers under BR (Battle Rank) 15 to help you get some quick Cert points. I suggest medic for new players as you can earn a TON of xp without having to kill anyone and medics are SUPER useful in big or small fights.",218230

58,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Look, you can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it. It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it. You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really good.

What I *am* going to try to do is let you know about a few things before you buy that I don't see a lot of people telling new players.

First, and maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*
- What does this mean?
If you buy FFXIV from Square Enix directly you can only buy future expansions from them and only them. This means that if steam is having a sale on the expansion you cannot participate in it. The same goes with Steam. If you buy the game on Steam you can only buy future expansions from steam and not Square. This can be frustrating as I've seen people buy their game from the wrong place and waste money. Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.

Second, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different
- What does this mean?
There are two types of subscriptions. 
The first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.
The second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. 
There are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. 

Third, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character
- What does this mean?
Every character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.

Overall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out.",39210
58,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,did you know that FINAL FANTASY XIV™ has a free trial up to level 60 that includes the entire base game as well as the critically acclaimed first expansion Heavensward™ with no time restriction,39210
58,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"This game presents itself for a large part of the main story as a single player RPG experience; the story is qualitywise comparable to single player Final Fantasy games which – in my opinion – is already an achievement. What really sets aside this game is the love for detail however. I was not expecting a world so full of life, colorful characters and well written plots. Especially the side adventures feature lots of comical elements.

The combat system feels refreshing. You get visual announcements to know what to do and where not stand. Learning by doing is often a welcome approach. You get extra rewards for having someone in your group who has not done the content yet.

The jobs in this game start out with a very basic concept but soon develop into a very well rounded and fun toolkit. The cooldown between the skills may make the battle system look slow at first but you keep unlocking skills that build up on those basic concepts in order to be able to create own solutions and approaches for all types of battles. The jobs differ nicely from each other in terms of core gameplay and positioning. All classes can be played on one character at the switch of a weapon and a crystal. Just to mention a few of many: There are summoners who utilize some of the well known summons of previous games to battle, healers who utilize white healing and protective spells to keep the group healthy or certain gunblade wielding tanks who give you a heavy sense of nostalgia. You will be able to unlock a mount in the form of a Chocobo early on who will also join you as a companion in battle. Different roles (damage dealer, healer or tank) can be taught to your Chocobo as skills. The chocobo is customisable in terms of color and gear (purely cosmetic).

Groups for content can be accessed by a search function or self-created. The size of the group (4 up to 24) depends heavily on the amount of time and effort you would like to invest. Queue times usually are not too long and can easily be bypassed by picking up a small adventure or two on the side. Hard content with different levels of progression is present in this game but not mandatory meaning that if you really want a challenge you will not have a trouble finding it.

There even is an amusement park, Gold Saucer, already known to some of you from playing Final Fantasy VII, which can be accessed to play small adventure games or e. g. Triple Triad (just as glorious as in Final Fantasy VIII) or to hang out with friends. You can purchase an appartment or a house which you can fill with self-created or purchased furnishings. You could even shape the layout to your liking. The location can be picked depending on which country you enjoy the most.

One of the jobs offers access to instruments (for example keyboard, guitar, flute) that can be used to perform. In some of the main cities you can sit down and watch people perform – sometimes even concerts are being held.

Flying is easily acquired in almost every zone by progressing the main story (not early on). Teleporting makes traveling fairly comfortable and easy. Leveling can be done with a variety of questing, dungeons or (non-instanced) world content. With a few weekly challenges you can get secondary jobs up to level swiftly.

The crafting system is a true gem. There is a variety of professions to pick from (e. g. goldsmith and carpenter). They are easy to pick up and items can be crafted with different qualities. A quality craft requires a certain amount of points to be acquired – this can be done by performing different kinds of rotations (you will pick up skills for this – just like in the jobs – while leveling up). There are also gathering professions that will yield you some of the required materials. Monsters can be avoided by a skill learned at early levels to gather efficiently. Later on you can even use your crafting to help rebuild a city.

The graphics are pretty and had – in comparison to a few other more current games – quite a low inpact on my system. With mid range components form years ago I could pretty easily play on high to maxed out settings. The animations are fluid and everything you press in combat feels (and looks) impactful.

Another awesome aspect of this game is the community. It is fairly easy to meet other players who also look for an enjoyable and positive experience. This game features a newbie chat where you can ask questions while playing. Mentors are also part of this chat to help. Becoming a mentor requires quite a bit of work in terms of ingame activies but from what I have seen people treat it as a privilege. Asking for help rarely goes unanswered here at pretty much all times. 

This game can be easily accessed and putting it down for something else was never an issue. Even a small amount of time can provide you with a good experience. I progressed the story in the evenings the last few weeks and was really impressed by how many weekly challenges feel optional instead of mandatory.

A few final words? First of all chapeau for releasing A Realm Reborn and Heavensward as free content (the core game and first expansion). Reading all of the above again this review feels overly positive – so far more than 300 hours in this game have not changed my mind. I wish I would have stumbled earlier upon this gem of a game. The love for detail in pretty much every direction is amazing. Thank you for all the hard work of developing this game over the years.

It makes it so you really don't have to spend any money on the game to know if you will like it. There are quite a few things unique to this MMO compared to others, so my biggest advice is to come in with an open mind.  There are some quality Youtubers out there that give great insights on different aspects of the game, so if you want to know how specific systems or classes work definitely watch a few of those.

PROS:
-New player and veteran friendly
-World design is so unique and gorgeous from region to region
-The community is friendly and always willing to help new players
-Each class is very unique and feels that way in combat
-Leveling alt classes is fast due to the built in xp boost
-End game is much more accessible than an MMO like WoW due to the shorter required times to run Trials and raids compared to full raids in WoW
-Large XP gained from relatively easy quests makes them feel very worth it

CONS:
-Much of the story is told via text which can make those scenes feel less immersive
-The game takes away your abilities when running lower level dungeons rather than scaling down the effectiveness of the abilities and allowing you to continue using them
-Loot drops much less frequently than in most other MMO games
-Purchasing a story skip without a level boost will likely ruin your early game experience with the game",39210

58,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,did you know that FINAL FANTASY XIV™ has a free trial up to level 60 that includes the entire base game as well as the critically acclaimed first expansion Heavensward™ with no time restriction,39210
58,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"This game presents itself for a large part of the main story as a single player RPG experience; the story is qualitywise comparable to single player Final Fantasy games which – in my opinion – is already an achievement. What really sets aside this game is the love for detail however. I was not expecting a world so full of life, colorful characters and well written plots. Especially the side adventures feature lots of comical elements.

The combat system feels refreshing. You get visual announcements to know what to do and where not stand. Learning by doing is often a welcome approach. You get extra rewards for having someone in your group who has not done the content yet.

The jobs in this game start out with a very basic concept but soon develop into a very well rounded and fun toolkit. The cooldown between the skills may make the battle system look slow at first but you keep unlocking skills that build up on those basic concepts in order to be able to create own solutions and approaches for all types of battles. The jobs differ nicely from each other in terms of core gameplay and positioning. All classes can be played on one character at the switch of a weapon and a crystal. Just to mention a few of many: There are summoners who utilize some of the well known summons of previous games to battle, healers who utilize white healing and protective spells to keep the group healthy or certain gunblade wielding tanks who give you a heavy sense of nostalgia. You will be able to unlock a mount in the form of a Chocobo early on who will also join you as a companion in battle. Different roles (damage dealer, healer or tank) can be taught to your Chocobo as skills. The chocobo is customisable in terms of color and gear (purely cosmetic).

Groups for content can be accessed by a search function or self-created. The size of the group (4 up to 24) depends heavily on the amount of time and effort you would like to invest. Queue times usually are not too long and can easily be bypassed by picking up a small adventure or two on the side. Hard content with different levels of progression is present in this game but not mandatory meaning that if you really want a challenge you will not have a trouble finding it.

There even is an amusement park, Gold Saucer, already known to some of you from playing Final Fantasy VII, which can be accessed to play small adventure games or e. g. Triple Triad (just as glorious as in Final Fantasy VIII) or to hang out with friends. You can purchase an appartment or a house which you can fill with self-created or purchased furnishings. You could even shape the layout to your liking. The location can be picked depending on which country you enjoy the most.

One of the jobs offers access to instruments (for example keyboard, guitar, flute) that can be used to perform. In some of the main cities you can sit down and watch people perform – sometimes even concerts are being held.

Flying is easily acquired in almost every zone by progressing the main story (not early on). Teleporting makes traveling fairly comfortable and easy. Leveling can be done with a variety of questing, dungeons or (non-instanced) world content. With a few weekly challenges you can get secondary jobs up to level swiftly.

The crafting system is a true gem. There is a variety of professions to pick from (e. g. goldsmith and carpenter). They are easy to pick up and items can be crafted with different qualities. A quality craft requires a certain amount of points to be acquired – this can be done by performing different kinds of rotations (you will pick up skills for this – just like in the jobs – while leveling up). There are also gathering professions that will yield you some of the required materials. Monsters can be avoided by a skill learned at early levels to gather efficiently. Later on you can even use your crafting to help rebuild a city.

The graphics are pretty and had – in comparison to a few other more current games – quite a low inpact on my system. With mid range components form years ago I could pretty easily play on high to maxed out settings. The animations are fluid and everything you press in combat feels (and looks) impactful.

Another awesome aspect of this game is the community. It is fairly easy to meet other players who also look for an enjoyable and positive experience. This game features a newbie chat where you can ask questions while playing. Mentors are also part of this chat to help. Becoming a mentor requires quite a bit of work in terms of ingame activies but from what I have seen people treat it as a privilege. Asking for help rarely goes unanswered here at pretty much all times. 

This game can be easily accessed and putting it down for something else was never an issue. Even a small amount of time can provide you with a good experience. I progressed the story in the evenings the last few weeks and was really impressed by how many weekly challenges feel optional instead of mandatory.

A few final words? First of all chapeau for releasing A Realm Reborn and Heavensward as free content (the core game and first expansion). Reading all of the above again this review feels overly positive – so far more than 300 hours in this game have not changed my mind. I wish I would have stumbled earlier upon this gem of a game. The love for detail in pretty much every direction is amazing. Thank you for all the hard work of developing this game over the years.

58,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"Overall the game is great.  The fact that you can play with very few restrictions all the way to level 60 is fantastic. It makes it so you really don't have to spend any money on the game to know if you will like it. There are quite a few things unique to this MMO compared to others, so my biggest advice is to come in with an open mind.  There are some quality Youtubers out there that give great insights on different aspects of the game, so if you want to know how specific systems or classes work definitely watch a few of those.

PROS:
-New player and veteran friendly
-World design is so unique and gorgeous from region to region
-The community is friendly and always willing to help new players
-Each class is very unique and feels that way in combat
-Leveling alt classes is fast due to the built in xp boost
-End game is much more accessible than an MMO like WoW due to the shorter required times to run Trials and raids compared to full raids in WoW
-Large XP gained from relatively easy quests makes them feel very worth it

CONS:
-Much of the story is told via text which can make those scenes feel less immersive
-The game takes away your abilities when running lower level dungeons rather than scaling down the effectiveness of the abilities and allowing you to continue using them
-Loot drops much less frequently than in most other MMO games
-Purchasing a story skip without a level boost will likely ruin your early game experience with the game",39210

59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Let me tell an amazing story about what trove what once was compared to what trove is now.

EDIT3: HERE IS A COUNTUP FOR THE TIME THE DEVELOPERS STILL HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO THIS REVIEW.
https://www.tickcounter.com/countup/22961/time-since-no-developer-reponse-for-my-top-review-on-trove-with-various-complaints

[h1]What was:[/h1]
An amazing sandbox/RPG style game that existed when I was in 8th grade(around 2 years ago). I would log in with one of my best friends and play, level, and build. Classes cost in game currency, so it only took around ~2 months for me of playing an hour a day to obtain every single class. Leveling was not difficult, mounts were not hard to get, and reaching max level was only a matter of time and not that far from people who spent money on this game. Market was somewhat balanced, item mall did not give too many OP items, and it was possible to see people reach max level without spending a single cent. Streamers were nice, loved the game(I was part of a streamer's guild and watched 20+ hours of his stream), and had massive giveaways that simply made every minute of this game fun to play. Grinding was not that annoying since drop rates were not unreasonable, and crafting materials were not so difficult to find or buy from others. When I would happen to get bored(very rarely), it would be a 'why not' to just go ahead and play some soccer from a stadium one of the guild members created. Toxicity and scammers were uncommon, since many people were flourishing and being quite successful both economically and emotionally. I was mastery 60/100 at that time after only about ~150 hours(before steam release obviously).
[h1]After Steam Release:[/h1]
Trove created a ""Patron Pass"", basically a premium subscription based system that when activated, gave double drop rate, double exp, and multiple other benefits. This seemed miniscule at first, since not only was this given out two weeks for free, the buffs do not look that overpowered at first. However, at a deeper glance, trove seemed to slowly lower drop rates for rare items, and people would have to rely on Patron benefits to simply live like the old life of the f2p player BEFORE the steam release. However, this by itself was not bad, since trove gained more populrity, Trion struggeld to keep servers up. Level cap increased to 200. I only pushed myself for another 40-50 hours to make myself readch around level 90/200. Many systems were added to late game characters that seemed to break the economy, as late game players were the ones with 99% of the money. Imagine the game's economy going into a elitist form of economy, that's how it became. Materials became 20x more expensive(Going from 1 flux to 20) and some items were downright impossible to afford. I realized even though I spend more than 150 hours on this game before steam release, I was no poorer than a brand new player who spent 10 hours after steam realease.
[h1]After the ""Cancer Patch"":[/h1]
This. This is the patch that ruined the game. Trion made it so classes could no longer be purchased with in game currency.  Trion claimed that this was to increase the variety among the classes and make people feel more individualized. However, nothing was actually done TO the classes to make them feel more different. In fact, besides a few unnoticable buffs/nerfs, classes remained virtually the same, so Trion failed to communicate that to the people. Although I had every single class(they released a class later that I obviously cannot get without giving them my cash), it seemed like a horrendously stupid move as more people started to actually play this game. 
The classes problem was only the beginning. They added flying mounts later(Dragons). At first this sounds like an amazing idea, as these flying mounts were faster than wings. However, you'd have to do daily quests every day for around a month to obtain one. That system was cancer, since logging in every day to do the same thing just to log out was monotonous and boring, Trion decided to scrap that system too. Since players were actually obtaining these mounts(How horrible right? /s), Trion decided to nerf this system and make a convoluted system where getting these dragons was near impossible and you would literally have to spend x3 the time getting these materials(since they divided the item into a 3 part item that needed to be crafted, hence x3 the time), getting these mounts was a fruitless endeavor.
As stated before, the economy was in ruin, so there was no way to be able to recover without buying items to sell in the item mall, or buying mounts directly that increased your level. I gave up at level 100/300, dirt broke even after grinding in the beta and doing 50 hours of grinding after steam release. Streamers have quit, even the streamer's guild I mentioned before had dissipated(LegendaryStudios). All my friends quit and think of this only as a 'meme game'. After Trion added more and more to the item mall that made this game completely pay2win, this game became a generic f2p that lost all originality that this game once was.  This game had a lot of history with me, and now that simply is just a memory.

Beta:
9/10
Steam Release:
5/10
""Cancer"" Patch:
1/10

EDIT1:I have recently read other reviews and I have noticed a common pattern. Devs seem to ignore and lock threads that have expressed concerns for the huge amount of bugs(since I did not mention these in my original review), huge gameplay downsides, and obvious player distaste for the cancer patch. When the players showed their absolute animosity towards changing a major system in the game(such as the classes costing real money), Trion did NOTHING to calm down the players or change this horrible system.

EDIT2:I never knew this review would actually gain a lot of support from the steam community, so thanks for the support. However, I will say be wary of this review and if it gets taken down, you know what happened.",304050
59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"My advice.... Save your time and money.

I can't emphasize this enough, yes its ""free to play"" but you WILL end up paying something, if not a lot of your hard earned cash. 90% of the same old bugs from beta are still there, events are recycled to the point everyone just AFK farms them and the actual content updates come around once a year. All that is left is grinding. 

Once you get to U9, where the majority of the people are, you will be plagued by rubber banding, slow chunk loading and constant disconnects. The devs really don't care, the fact they refuse to comment on it and delete or lock threads on the forum where people express their concerns, shows this. They just want new people to play, get hooked and shell out loads of cash before they realize it.

I wish I had been warned before I invested so much time/money into the game. (not through steam)

Trove is a great game at its core, its just run by a greedy, money grabbing company with absolutely no respect for its players/customers.",304050
59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Awesome game, with great content and even better community.
However it's heavy on bugs/glitches and lacking support on forums. Servers & connectivity are horrible!",304050
59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews this past week and just wanted to write my review.  Currently 400+ hours into the game.  It is an amazing break from World of Warcraft as leveling up to about 15ish is very easy going.  Weekly rewards are nice to get, and the in-game community is pretty nice and helpful.  Dailies are nice too as after x amount of times opening Chaos Chest, you are guarenteed a mount/ally/something cool.  You get a lot of free stuff at first - like Mastery Rewards and cheap in-game deals (I would suggest buying the starter pack if you can spare $10).  I was expecting to find a lot of little kids playing this game, but I've actually found more young adults and some older adults too.  

If grinding and patience is not your thing, you will not enjoy this game.  The game does have some lag issues, and I've died a few times to it, but it's not all the time.   Building in this game is a bit different than Minecraft, and if you hate building there are plenty of other things to do.  It's definetly more enjoyable with friends or finding new in-game friends!",304050
59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I'm filled with nostalgia when I go back to my very first Trove club, to still see it remain standing strong. Even though it is virtually dead, atleast I can see where we first plotted our spawn point, the musical roads, a good quantity of mazes produced throughout the club's life time and numerous buildings that were once endevours. So many friends I stumbled upon during my activeness in the game. I love building with my Trove buddies more than that actual mining, leveling up, and slaining bosses. Happiness filled my soul because of this marvelous game.",304050
59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"[h1]Trove of adventures![/h1]
[i]As i'm sure everyone would say after playing this game, where should I begin?[/i]

[b]Graphics:[/b]
If I had to say, I wouldn't say top notch. The graphics is okay, they can bug you. Minecraftish style but not as bad. There is alot more animation's, alot more detail. Do not take this the wrong way. The game hasn't done wrong, it feels right in a blocky sense of way.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Fantastic, that's what I say. The gameplay makes up for alot within the game. You can find alot to do. The recent ingame changes are also very nice. New level caps also I noticed. I know Trove gets some nice updates and some odd ones. Either way you cut the cake, you might still get cherries ontop. What I mean is, the updates normally consists of cons n pros, depending on wether you like cherries or not, some cons to others are pros. 
I honestly can't say how much gameplay there is while describing each one. It is just too much. You'll have to read more about it if you don't already know much. Basic gameplay is both creative and adventure. You will want friends or a club world to help out. You can own your own worlds, house, pets. You can wear any decoration, infact, the loot collector and item hunting is very uniqe making you as a player want to find every piece. Each piece you collect is saved & can be overlayered on set equipment. Base game rewards, item shop, minor NPC support. Alot to keep you going. It is mostly PvE, PvP is a thing too.

[b]SoundFX:[/b]
While being blocky in a block like world, you'd expect the characters of the world to sound different. They have nailed this. Music and sounds are pretty good. I'd have to say it wasn't expected but yes, the game sounds are good. The basic attack or hit sounds however is the same old sound, some soundFX are loopy.

[b]PTW or FTP?:[/b]
This is one of the big concerns when entering a FTP game. Yes, it is FTP. 100%
The great thing about trove is how much they actually have to offer FTP. They don't charge you for club worlds or properties, they don't charge you for alot that they could or other games had or do now. The PTW options are minor but continues to support the servers. As any game, PTW has the options to speed up you're progress towards the game or simply for cosmetic styles. It is simply a choice. Do you enjoy the game? Do you feel it is under valued? Do you feel like the devs did decent work? Questions you ask yourself may lead to you spending a few bucks. But by all means, it is only optional, the choices we're in control to make. The game I'd have to say is FTP.

[u][b]Personnal notes:[/b][/u]
This isn't survival, nor is it up to the standards of graphics these days. It is something I do enjoy playing so I must recommend it. Creativity lovers will really enjoy Trove as most already have. I do suggest playing Trove, espeacially if you don't mind low end graphics with high gameplay value. [u]Be warned,[/u] it is a MMO, it is a RPG. put these two together, you got yourself a cracked egg. The game can be very addictive as any MMORPG.

Graphics:5.0
SoundFX:6.0
Funfactor:7.5
Overall:6.5

59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"This game is great. For anyone that loves to become more and more powerful by leveling up and playing with friends, this is the game for you. For anyone that loves to get endless loot and strive to become one of the most powerful players, this game is for you. But there's a small problem. 

This game is entirely a money run. I don't think I've ever seen a game that is more pay2win than this one. You can literally buy yourself to being some of the most powerful players in the game, despite all those players that choose not to spend any money. Most people who say this game isn't pay2win are people who have spent hundreds of dollars themselves, choosing to deny their own waste of money. For anyone that still thinks this game isn't controllable with money, look at the ""shop"". You can buy all classes, infinite ""gem dust"", and anything else you need to become maxed out. So unless you want to play this game for three years straight while grinding for what seems to be for a fraction of the power the pay2wins have, be my guest and waste your time.

It was fun for me to grind hours on end to get practically no where. The farming is not rewarding. The entire game is dependant on RNG and chance. Community is half toxic. Classes were acually pretty great. New players are going to have a hard time starting out due to characters now costing money. Much of it is if you pay you can do MUCH better than others. But then again its not worth paying for this game anyways most the time. I did have some great times in this game but it died off from lack of content and purpose. It did however keep me company for a long time, and i did have fun it it while it lasted.",304050

59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Let me tell an amazing story about what trove what once was compared to what trove is now.

EDIT3: HERE IS A COUNTUP FOR THE TIME THE DEVELOPERS STILL HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO THIS REVIEW.
https://www.tickcounter.com/countup/22961/time-since-no-developer-reponse-for-my-top-review-on-trove-with-various-complaints

[h1]What was:[/h1]
An amazing sandbox/RPG style game that existed when I was in 8th grade(around 2 years ago). I would log in with one of my best friends and play, level, and build. Classes cost in game currency, so it only took around ~2 months for me of playing an hour a day to obtain every single class. Leveling was not difficult, mounts were not hard to get, and reaching max level was only a matter of time and not that far from people who spent money on this game. Market was somewhat balanced, item mall did not give too many OP items, and it was possible to see people reach max level without spending a single cent. Streamers were nice, loved the game(I was part of a streamer's guild and watched 20+ hours of his stream), and had massive giveaways that simply made every minute of this game fun to play. Grinding was not that annoying since drop rates were not unreasonable, and crafting materials were not so difficult to find or buy from others. When I would happen to get bored(very rarely), it would be a 'why not' to just go ahead and play some soccer from a stadium one of the guild members created. Toxicity and scammers were uncommon, since many people were flourishing and being quite successful both economically and emotionally. I was mastery 60/100 at that time after only about ~150 hours(before steam release obviously).
[h1]After Steam Release:[/h1]
Trove created a ""Patron Pass"", basically a premium subscription based system that when activated, gave double drop rate, double exp, and multiple other benefits. This seemed miniscule at first, since not only was this given out two weeks for free, the buffs do not look that overpowered at first. However, at a deeper glance, trove seemed to slowly lower drop rates for rare items, and people would have to rely on Patron benefits to simply live like the old life of the f2p player BEFORE the steam release. However, this by itself was not bad, since trove gained more populrity, Trion struggeld to keep servers up. Level cap increased to 200. I only pushed myself for another 40-50 hours to make myself readch around level 90/200. Many systems were added to late game characters that seemed to break the economy, as late game players were the ones with 99% of the money. Imagine the game's economy going into a elitist form of economy, that's how it became. Materials became 20x more expensive(Going from 1 flux to 20) and some items were downright impossible to afford. I realized even though I spend more than 150 hours on this game before steam release, I was no poorer than a brand new player who spent 10 hours after steam realease.
[h1]After the ""Cancer Patch"":[/h1]
This. This is the patch that ruined the game. Trion made it so classes could no longer be purchased with in game currency.  Trion claimed that this was to increase the variety among the classes and make people feel more individualized. However, nothing was actually done TO the classes to make them feel more different. In fact, besides a few unnoticable buffs/nerfs, classes remained virtually the same, so Trion failed to communicate that to the people. Although I had every single class(they released a class later that I obviously cannot get without giving them my cash), it seemed like a horrendously stupid move as more people started to actually play this game. 
The classes problem was only the beginning. They added flying mounts later(Dragons). At first this sounds like an amazing idea, as these flying mounts were faster than wings. However, you'd have to do daily quests every day for around a month to obtain one. That system was cancer, since logging in every day to do the same thing just to log out was monotonous and boring, Trion decided to scrap that system too. Since players were actually obtaining these mounts(How horrible right? /s), Trion decided to nerf this system and make a convoluted system where getting these dragons was near impossible and you would literally have to spend x3 the time getting these materials(since they divided the item into a 3 part item that needed to be crafted, hence x3 the time), getting these mounts was a fruitless endeavor.
As stated before, the economy was in ruin, so there was no way to be able to recover without buying items to sell in the item mall, or buying mounts directly that increased your level. I gave up at level 100/300, dirt broke even after grinding in the beta and doing 50 hours of grinding after steam release. Streamers have quit, even the streamer's guild I mentioned before had dissipated(LegendaryStudios). All my friends quit and think of this only as a 'meme game'. After Trion added more and more to the item mall that made this game completely pay2win, this game became a generic f2p that lost all originality that this game once was.  This game had a lot of history with me, and now that simply is just a memory.

Beta:
9/10
Steam Release:
5/10
""Cancer"" Patch:
1/10

EDIT1:I have recently read other reviews and I have noticed a common pattern. Devs seem to ignore and lock threads that have expressed concerns for the huge amount of bugs(since I did not mention these in my original review), huge gameplay downsides, and obvious player distaste for the cancer patch. When the players showed their absolute animosity towards changing a major system in the game(such as the classes costing real money), Trion did NOTHING to calm down the players or change this horrible system.

EDIT2:I never knew this review would actually gain a lot of support from the steam community, so thanks for the support. However, I will say be wary of this review and if it gets taken down, you know what happened.",304050
59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"My advice.... Save your time and money.

I can't emphasize this enough, yes its ""free to play"" but you WILL end up paying something, if not a lot of your hard earned cash. 90% of the same old bugs from beta are still there, events are recycled to the point everyone just AFK farms them and the actual content updates come around once a year. All that is left is grinding. 

Once you get to U9, where the majority of the people are, you will be plagued by rubber banding, slow chunk loading and constant disconnects. The devs really don't care, the fact they refuse to comment on it and delete or lock threads on the forum where people express their concerns, shows this. They just want new people to play, get hooked and shell out loads of cash before they realize it.

I wish I had been warned before I invested so much time/money into the game. (not through steam)

Trove is a great game at its core, its just run by a greedy, money grabbing company with absolutely no respect for its players/customers.",304050
59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Awesome game, with great content and even better community.
However it's heavy on bugs/glitches and lacking support on forums. Servers & connectivity are horrible!",304050
59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews this past week and just wanted to write my review.  Currently 400+ hours into the game.  It is an amazing break from World of Warcraft as leveling up to about 15ish is very easy going.  Weekly rewards are nice to get, and the in-game community is pretty nice and helpful.  Dailies are nice too as after x amount of times opening Chaos Chest, you are guarenteed a mount/ally/something cool.  You get a lot of free stuff at first - like Mastery Rewards and cheap in-game deals (I would suggest buying the starter pack if you can spare $10).  I was expecting to find a lot of little kids playing this game, but I've actually found more young adults and some older adults too.  

If grinding and patience is not your thing, you will not enjoy this game.  The game does have some lag issues, and I've died a few times to it, but it's not all the time.   Building in this game is a bit different than Minecraft, and if you hate building there are plenty of other things to do.  It's definetly more enjoyable with friends or finding new in-game friends!",304050
59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"I'm filled with nostalgia when I go back to my very first Trove club, to still see it remain standing strong. Even though it is virtually dead, atleast I can see where we first plotted our spawn point, the musical roads, a good quantity of mazes produced throughout the club's life time and numerous buildings that were once endevours. So many friends I stumbled upon during my activeness in the game. I love building with my Trove buddies more than that actual mining, leveling up, and slaining bosses. Happiness filled my soul because of this marvelous game.",304050
59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"[h1]Trove of adventures![/h1]
[i]As i'm sure everyone would say after playing this game, where should I begin?[/i]

[b]Graphics:[/b]
If I had to say, I wouldn't say top notch. The graphics is okay, they can bug you. Minecraftish style but not as bad. There is alot more animation's, alot more detail. Do not take this the wrong way. The game hasn't done wrong, it feels right in a blocky sense of way.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Fantastic, that's what I say. The gameplay makes up for alot within the game. You can find alot to do. The recent ingame changes are also very nice. New level caps also I noticed. I know Trove gets some nice updates and some odd ones. Either way you cut the cake, you might still get cherries ontop. What I mean is, the updates normally consists of cons n pros, depending on wether you like cherries or not, some cons to others are pros. 
I honestly can't say how much gameplay there is while describing each one. It is just too much. You'll have to read more about it if you don't already know much. Basic gameplay is both creative and adventure. You will want friends or a club world to help out. You can own your own worlds, house, pets. You can wear any decoration, infact, the loot collector and item hunting is very uniqe making you as a player want to find every piece. Each piece you collect is saved & can be overlayered on set equipment. Base game rewards, item shop, minor NPC support. Alot to keep you going. It is mostly PvE, PvP is a thing too.

[b]SoundFX:[/b]
While being blocky in a block like world, you'd expect the characters of the world to sound different. They have nailed this. Music and sounds are pretty good. I'd have to say it wasn't expected but yes, the game sounds are good. The basic attack or hit sounds however is the same old sound, some soundFX are loopy.

[b]PTW or FTP?:[/b]
This is one of the big concerns when entering a FTP game. Yes, it is FTP. 100%
The great thing about trove is how much they actually have to offer FTP. They don't charge you for club worlds or properties, they don't charge you for alot that they could or other games had or do now. The PTW options are minor but continues to support the servers. As any game, PTW has the options to speed up you're progress towards the game or simply for cosmetic styles. It is simply a choice. Do you enjoy the game? Do you feel it is under valued? Do you feel like the devs did decent work? Questions you ask yourself may lead to you spending a few bucks. But by all means, it is only optional, the choices we're in control to make. The game I'd have to say is FTP.

[u][b]Personnal notes:[/b][/u]
This isn't survival, nor is it up to the standards of graphics these days. It is something I do enjoy playing so I must recommend it. Creativity lovers will really enjoy Trove as most already have. I do suggest playing Trove, espeacially if you don't mind low end graphics with high gameplay value. [u]Be warned,[/u] it is a MMO, it is a RPG. put these two together, you got yourself a cracked egg. The game can be very addictive as any MMORPG.

Graphics:5.0
SoundFX:6.0
Funfactor:7.5
Overall:6.5

59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"2k hours and i have to say everything on this game is good but there is some negative things for this game

- super lag game 
- ultra pay to win game ( if you want to go higher mastery rank level you need to buy pack that give you mastery rank xp like 20$ to 50$ to get that pack  there is no free to play on this game if you are rich preson and you don't know where you put your money this game is right place for you. You will be come poor on 2 days)  i have spent like 300$ to this game so may i help devs to fix lag on this game but nothing change. Not only me who spend like that there is some players spend more and more to help devs but nothing change.

59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"This game is great. For anyone that loves to become more and more powerful by leveling up and playing with friends, this is the game for you. For anyone that loves to get endless loot and strive to become one of the most powerful players, this game is for you. But there's a small problem. 

This game is entirely a money run. I don't think I've ever seen a game that is more pay2win than this one. You can literally buy yourself to being some of the most powerful players in the game, despite all those players that choose not to spend any money. Most people who say this game isn't pay2win are people who have spent hundreds of dollars themselves, choosing to deny their own waste of money. For anyone that still thinks this game isn't controllable with money, look at the ""shop"". You can buy all classes, infinite ""gem dust"", and anything else you need to become maxed out. So unless you want to play this game for three years straight while grinding for what seems to be for a fraction of the power the pay2wins have, be my guest and waste your time.


The keyword here, in case you didn't catch it, is: pay2win",304050
59,Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"Trove is amazing.........for a while at least. You see, the thrill is present in the beginnings of when you play this game ,but it slowly lessens until you realized that the game is very grindy and boring. The same dungeon, same items, and has a pay2win tone to it and it kinda breaks my heart because of that. The gem update feature makes it feel like the developers want to grab your cash on ""broken gems.""

Maybe if the game gets a HUGE update in gameplay I would rate it better.",304050

Wild Shadow did everything perfect with this game.  Then Kabam bought them out and turned it into more of a pay to win.  Kabam did some good, but mostly bad.  They owned Realm for a long time, but very recently a company called DECA bought it from Kabam.  DECA has been incredible in my opinion.  They have released more updates in two months than Kabam did in 5 years.  New things and skins and map changes, it's exactly whatneeded to happen.  So, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it right now.  About 6 months ago I would've said not to bother.  I just hope DECA keeps with it",200210

60,Realm of the Mad God Exalt,Massively%20Multiplayer,200210,"Man where do I even start with this game.. I started like 12867 years ago when it came out on Kongregate and it was awesome! Wild Shadow did everything perfect with this game.  Then Kabam bought them out and turned it into more of a pay to win.  Kabam did some good, but mostly bad.  They owned Realm for a long time, but very recently a company called DECA bought it from Kabam.  DECA has been incredible in my opinion.  They have released more updates in two months than Kabam did in 5 years.  New things and skins and map changes, it's exactly whatneeded to happen.  So, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it right now.  About 6 months ago I would've said not to bother.  I just hope DECA keeps with it",200210

Lost Ark Online an incredibly polished MMORPG, filled to the brim with content. 
Every single class feels extremely unique and fun to play. You've got several ways to play a class, you can reset your skill points for free at any time to adjust your build to the content too.
No holy trinity here, so don't be afraid of needing to play a specific class to feel wanted in endgame content. 

The world is huge, HUGE.
You start the game on one continent, then once you're done with the very cool story with superb cutscenes, of which the quality only get better through the story, you get to sail on a ship and can choose to do sea activities or go to other continents to continue the main sceario quest or all the islands out there to find things like collectibles, extra skill points...
The leveling experience is a wonderful ride. The dungeons are fun, and quite a few are straight up SPECTACULAR. 

It's graphically one of the most impressive MMORPGs out there. It looks BEAUTIFUL, almost every area is just so pleasing in its own way. From fae lands, to wuxia towns, to literally Midgar from Final Fantasy 7, there's a huge amount of diversity in aesthetics between the continents and it's great.

I just love this game a lot overall. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",1599340
62,Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Holy shit please just release it, after playing the alpha im addicted",1599340
62,Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Let's start by opening with: it isn't P2W - for those that have played in other versions (myself included) monetisation is not something to be concerned about.

With perfectly equalised and balanced arena PvP, and even a number of equalised raids as well (with rank boards for clears), this is a great game for both competitive PvPers and PvErs alike.

There are viable progression paths for all sorts of people, be they casual or hardcore, F2P or whale, or any combination.

The game is incredibly fun and will definitely scratch the itch that many of us have been having for a proper, high-quality AAA MMORPG - I've been enjoying this casually in other regions and plan to make it my main game once its out in the West, because it definitely has the appeal to keep me hooked long-term.

...

Now, if you're interested in a little history:

MMORPGs have not been doing too hot lately - from the golden age of the early 2010s where a new big MMO was coming to ""dethrone WoW"" every other week, the genre has been starved as MOBAs and Battle Royales took the mainstream spot.

With limited releases and an aging genre, there just isn't much of anything fresh coming along - expansions for other, older MMOs can seem more appealing than betting on new indie releases.

With this context, Lost Ark comes at the greatest possible time. Teased way back in GSTAR 2014 - when our MMO fever was at its peak - this strange yet uniquely appealing Diablo-esque looking MMO was hyped beyond belief.

Being in development hell for years, it wasn't until December 2018 (almost 2019) that it saw its full release in Korea. With a rocky journey, it faced multiple revamps and region releases, trying to find its own identity.

Yet now, it has been the most played MMORPG in Korea for months on end (according to http://gametrics.com/) - and it is in this polished state that we are getting Lost Ark in the West.

And gosh, polished it is! 

Classes are varied with unique identities (both figuratively and literally, given the identity system), there is all sorts of content - from competitive PvP and raiding to exploration and lifeskilling - as well as incredibly entertaining dungeons and core system mechanics.

The developers have been on a warpath to deliver new content, releasing multiple endgame raids in short periods of time and constantly adjusting balancing to fine tune class performance. The game is most definitely loved, not just by players, but by its own developers.

It doesn't stop at the gameplay either. A beautiful score and incredible graphics, you can lose yourself in playing the multiple dungeons and raids. Whether doing little island sidequests or experiencing the cutscenes in the main questline, there is a real sense of awe as you go through the content this game has to offer.

It is an MMORPG - you'll do the old school running through quests, levelling up, grouping up with people for raids and gearing up your characters. Sometimes though, that's exactly the experience you want. Lost Ark Online provides just that, but with polish.

I have been playing this game casually for the past 2 years - now that it is coming to the West I plan to make this my main game with no hesitation.

Great game, probably one of the best MMOs out there and - as a matter of fact (according to ratings) - the best KRMMO out there currently.",1599340
62,Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn't want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.

The dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.

People who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won't replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don't use the boxes.

PvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules ""No healing potions, no ultimates"" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it's my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can't do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I'll leave it as ""I'm new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being"".

Addressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don't feel it's a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That's pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don't have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it's not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.

Classes. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won't be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren't available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I'm not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn't' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.

So to wrap it up, as someone who went in with 0 expectation, and 0 knowledge of the game, I really enjoyed it. I think the market is in serious need of a new MMO format, and this is a game I will gamble on.",1599340

You start the game on one continent, then once you're done with the very cool story with superb cutscenes, of which the quality only get better through the story, you get to sail on a ship and can choose to do sea activities or go to other continents to continue the main sceario quest or all the islands out there to find things like collectibles, extra skill points...
The leveling experience is a wonderful ride. The dungeons are fun, and quite a few are straight up SPECTACULAR. 

It's graphically one of the most impressive MMORPGs out there. It looks BEAUTIFUL, almost every area is just so pleasing in its own way. From fae lands, to wuxia towns, to literally Midgar from Final Fantasy 7, there's a huge amount of diversity in aesthetics between the continents and it's great.

I just love this game a lot overall. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",1599340

62,Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Let's start by opening with: it isn't P2W - for those that have played in other versions (myself included) monetisation is not something to be concerned about.

With perfectly equalised and balanced arena PvP, and even a number of equalised raids as well (with rank boards for clears), this is a great game for both competitive PvPers and PvErs alike.

There are viable progression paths for all sorts of people, be they casual or hardcore, F2P or whale, or any combination.

The game is incredibly fun and will definitely scratch the itch that many of us have been having for a proper, high-quality AAA MMORPG - I've been enjoying this casually in other regions and plan to make it my main game once its out in the West, because it definitely has the appeal to keep me hooked long-term.

...

Now, if you're interested in a little history:

MMORPGs have not been doing too hot lately - from the golden age of the early 2010s where a new big MMO was coming to ""dethrone WoW"" every other week, the genre has been starved as MOBAs and Battle Royales took the mainstream spot.

With limited releases and an aging genre, there just isn't much of anything fresh coming along - expansions for other, older MMOs can seem more appealing than betting on new indie releases.

With this context, Lost Ark comes at the greatest possible time. Teased way back in GSTAR 2014 - when our MMO fever was at its peak - this strange yet uniquely appealing Diablo-esque looking MMO was hyped beyond belief.

Being in development hell for years, it wasn't until December 2018 (almost 2019) that it saw its full release in Korea. With a rocky journey, it faced multiple revamps and region releases, trying to find its own identity.

Yet now, it has been the most played MMORPG in Korea for months on end (according to http://gametrics.com/) - and it is in this polished state that we are getting Lost Ark in the West.

And gosh, polished it is! 

Classes are varied with unique identities (both figuratively and literally, given the identity system), there is all sorts of content - from competitive PvP and raiding to exploration and lifeskilling - as well as incredibly entertaining dungeons and core system mechanics.

The developers have been on a warpath to deliver new content, releasing multiple endgame raids in short periods of time and constantly adjusting balancing to fine tune class performance. The game is most definitely loved, not just by players, but by its own developers.

It doesn't stop at the gameplay either. A beautiful score and incredible graphics, you can lose yourself in playing the multiple dungeons and raids. Whether doing little island sidequests or experiencing the cutscenes in the main questline, there is a real sense of awe as you go through the content this game has to offer.

It is an MMORPG - you'll do the old school running through quests, levelling up, grouping up with people for raids and gearing up your characters. Sometimes though, that's exactly the experience you want. Lost Ark Online provides just that, but with polish.

I have been playing this game casually for the past 2 years - now that it is coming to the West I plan to make this my main game with no hesitation.

Great game, probably one of the best MMOs out there and - as a matter of fact (according to ratings) - the best KRMMO out there currently.",1599340
62,Lost Ark,Massively%20Multiplayer,1599340,"Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn't want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.

The dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.

People who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won't replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don't use the boxes.

PvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules ""No healing potions, no ultimates"" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it's my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can't do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I'll leave it as ""I'm new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being"".

Addressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don't feel it's a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That's pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don't have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it's not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.

Classes. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won't be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren't available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I'm not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn't' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.

So to wrap it up, as someone who went in with 0 expectation, and 0 knowledge of the game, I really enjoyed it. I think the market is in serious need of a new MMO format, and this is a game I will gamble on.",1599340

64,CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,"This review is based on my personal experience with the game.

If you only want a decent drifting platform, the devs got a good one.

They also only censored swear words and other terms like 'fart' but all racial slurs and hate speech terms are uncensored and (including gta 5) this is the most toxic online community I have ever come across.  Most nights has about 400 active gamers online between servers and the open chat.  I had over 93 on block for telling anyone who wasn't a white heterosexual to kill themselves every single time I was in there, which I was on every night but two days in over a 3 week span. I was telling my friend about it and he told me his son had to stop playing the game because of suicidal thoughts from the chat on it, because he is gay. 

I reached out to the devs, like others have, about this and they just ignore or mute you. I have nothing go on why they don't care about any of that, but after beating the game in 3 days, and finding it quite boring beyond the 20 tracks or so they give you (including a reverse run for each track, talk about lazy mappers, but whatever, mods can help that out I guess).

They did three updates I think since I played the game. They have actually ruined the 5 cars I enjoyed using so there's legitimately nothing here for me, now.

I just wanted to come on here and warn all about how toxic and hateful this particular niche community is.  

And to think I was so excited about Car X Street, but I won't be going near this studio after seeing their fans. It even brought up a very important discussion for the studio I'm currently a writer for, and how we're going to implement reprimands for people attempting to send hate speech that will block communications every time for a time limit when they attempt, not even letting it through.  It's not hard to do.  It just takes effort and 'want' and I can't see any proof these Devs want anything but more toxicity. 

'happy' drifting.

If you have any mental health concerns, or the person you're gifting this to has them...  Don't.

You could very well be doing them a disservice",635260
64,CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,"pros: its a decent game to mindlessly slide around, it has a fair bit of vehicles to modify, the handling is alright and its easy to get into, 

cons: the scoring system seems to lean alot towards insane angles and speed more than precision driving and smooth transitions and lines, the engine sounds are very bland, the global chat is like a call of duty voice chat lobby and there seem to be alot of very angry and or just vulgar people spamming there at every hours of the day,

all and all it kinda feels like a half baked game, but i wouldnt recommend it mainly for the reason that it gets stale fairly quick and if ur hoping to just relax and slide around and maybe chat to people in there u are going to have wade thru alot of very angry and immature people",635260

64,CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,"This review is based on my personal experience with the game.

If you only want a decent drifting platform, the devs got a good one.

They also only censored swear words and other terms like 'fart' but all racial slurs and hate speech terms are uncensored and (including gta 5) this is the most toxic online community I have ever come across.  Most nights has about 400 active gamers online between servers and the open chat.  I had over 93 on block for telling anyone who wasn't a white heterosexual to kill themselves every single time I was in there, which I was on every night but two days in over a 3 week span. I was telling my friend about it and he told me his son had to stop playing the game because of suicidal thoughts from the chat on it, because he is gay. 

I reached out to the devs, like others have, about this and they just ignore or mute you. I have nothing go on why they don't care about any of that, but after beating the game in 3 days, and finding it quite boring beyond the 20 tracks or so they give you (including a reverse run for each track, talk about lazy mappers, but whatever, mods can help that out I guess).

They did three updates I think since I played the game. They have actually ruined the 5 cars I enjoyed using so there's legitimately nothing here for me, now.

I just wanted to come on here and warn all about how toxic and hateful this particular niche community is.  

And to think I was so excited about Car X Street, but I won't be going near this studio after seeing their fans. It even brought up a very important discussion for the studio I'm currently a writer for, and how we're going to implement reprimands for people attempting to send hate speech that will block communications every time for a time limit when they attempt, not even letting it through.  It's not hard to do.  It just takes effort and 'want' and I can't see any proof these Devs want anything but more toxicity. 

'happy' drifting.

If you have any mental health concerns, or the person you're gifting this to has them...  Don't.

You could very well be doing them a disservice",635260
64,CarX Drift Racing Online,Sports,635260,"pros: its a decent game to mindlessly slide around, it has a fair bit of vehicles to modify, the handling is alright and its easy to get into, 

cons: the scoring system seems to lean alot towards insane angles and speed more than precision driving and smooth transitions and lines, the engine sounds are very bland, the global chat is like a call of duty voice chat lobby and there seem to be alot of very angry and or just vulgar people spamming there at every hours of the day,

all and all it kinda feels like a half baked game, but i wouldnt recommend it mainly for the reason that it gets stale fairly quick and if ur hoping to just relax and slide around and maybe chat to people in there u are going to have wade thru alot of very angry and immature people",635260

65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"It's been years since I purchased this game, and I've played for too long to be deemed healthy by health professionals. Seeing where this game started, and where it is now, I can only say:

I am Disappointed. 

I joined when you could play exclusively in a progressive tree (Small dinosaurs for x amount of times leads to the next tier of dinosaurs) to produce an ecology of sorts. They added AI, more rivers and lakes and removed progression. This, with the idea of promoting a sort of self sustained ecology, backfired. Discords promote pay to grow (discord points through donating to help keep servers running for example), means there are servers that are 95%+ carnivores, and of those, are likely spinos/gigas/rexes. They can survive exclusively on the added AI (this was not possible when it first started), and if they die, they can come back as full grown top tier carnivores within minutes. There is no ecology. 

Combat went from hiding in bushes, to abusing broken hit-boxes, or crossing fingers that lag was working for you and not against you. Imagine playing Darksouls but your dagger has the range of a claymore at 2x size. 

Today? They have legacy (Beta) and Evrima (Beta Beta). Legacy is broken hitboxes and laggy, Evrima is testing a new combat system. Great. There is no effort to making a standing ecology however. both versions have rubber banding issues, and playing a single player is difficult and have GREATLY reduced odds if having to survive against clans/groups of friends. The removal of global chat in official servers have reduced the amount of -toxic- chat in game, but have successfully pushed people to using 3rd party programs with reduced capability of warning other players of misbehavior in servers. 

Promises. Promises. So many things promoted to publix that haven't seen light in years. ""Hypo"" Dinosaurs were seen briefly before being revoked from public access. Only devs could use them, and then devs stopped visiting server to show, no, -flaunt- this exclusive feature until the lack of existance. Humans being added? No. Cannibals being added? No. Vicious environments? No (Except for crippling fall damage from cliffs and drowning) Number of dinosaurs available for public use? Reduced. Number of customizable skins? Reduced (Earthy/muted Color palettes in Legacy have shown promise, but there is only 1 skin available and no color changing in Evirma currently)

I feel in the years that have passed by, that the isle has shown very very poor improvement, and I don't expect this game to be better for -several years- at the rate and history that it has shown. 

There was improvement for the first year. After that, it's been a heart break to watch this beast slowly decay and become ruined. The community is divided between people who hate the game and people who can only hope for the best. These two side will viciously attack the other in defense of their opinion. A quick youtube search or a visit to the isle reddit can give you any little bit of research to decide your fate on clicking 'Buy"".

I post this review as a warning. It's fun for a little bit, but for a long term game, set your expectations low. I'll watch updates, but highly not recommend people playing due to slow development, lacking features, and toxic community.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"The first thing to know about The Isle in 2021 is the two separate versions: Legacy and Evirma.

 Legacy is the ""default"" version of the game, and the version most people play. It has lots of dinosaur species and a very active playerbase, AI dinosaurs for carnivores to hunt down, massive well detailed maps dotted with human landmarks, rivers, lakes, mountains, jungles, grasslands and beaches, and two main gamemodes: survival and sandbox. In sandbox, every non-exclusive dinosaur in the game is playable. You start as an adult and basically do whatever you want. This can range from Death Matches to Dino Chatting Rooms. In survival, less species are available but the gameplay is more dynamic. You start as a baby dino, either a juvenile on your own or a hatchling with a mother. As you feed, hunt and survive, you grow in size and strength, becoming faster and more formidable until you become a fully grown adult. It is often necessary to form groups with members of your own species to better the chances of surviving. If you are a female dino, you can have your own young when you become adult (The nesting system allows other players to teleport to you as hatchling dinos, but they are completely dependent on you until they become juveniles.)

So that's what Legacy has to offer. But whats the catch?

Legacy is the abandoned version of The Isle, no longer receiving updates from the devs. As such, it has lots of bugs, ranging from minor annoyances to game breaking glitches such as oversized hitboxes, rubberbanding, FPS drops, disconnections and more. There are also a few ""tricks"" that undermine the basic values of the game, such as tail riding. It can be more than infuriating when you lose your dino to something only describable as bad game design. Food spawns are also fickle. Certain regions of the maps lack AI for carnivores or bushes for herbivores. As such, many players tend to gather around hot spots rather than explore the maps. There are also toxic players who partake in frowned upon behavior such as ""carebearing"" or taking care of dinos that arent your own species, or ""KOSing"" or killing everything in sight for fun.

Now what about Evirma?

Evirma is an entirely new version of The Isle, a complete recode that was started after the Legacy code became too troublesome and frustrating for the dev team to work with. It has a lot of the features that Legacy had with more yet to come, in addition to many exciting new features including an entirely new map, new dinosaurs, reworks of old dinosaurs, new mechanics such as grazing for herbivores, grabbing dragging and swallowing kills for carnivores, new playstyles for unique creatures like pteranodon and deinosuchus, and new systems for food, perks and elder dinosaurs. Everything in Evirma is much more fluent and natural than Legacy, from movement to combat to the ecology of every distinct species. 

The catch?

Evirma is somewhat bare bones as of now, possessing a far smaller dino roster than Legacy. some features like the diet and elder systems have yet to be added, and as usual there are bugs. However, there have been regular patches and bug fixes from the devs, with a roadmap for future large scale updates already planned out.

Overall, The Isle is a very unique take on the survival genre, and a delight for fans of dinosaurs and paleontology. Progress has been slow but steady, and the game already has a lot of promise with its dynamic gameplay. If you love survival games and dinosaurs, this ones for you. If you're more a fan of fast paced games, maybe pass on this one (Growth takes a while :D.)",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"After 1325 Hours of this game I think I can give a decent Review...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEGACY IS DEAD - Not being updated at all and has hardly any player base at least for Australia.

Erivma is Alive - BUT is a toxic pool of Mixpacking Chinese hackers that will find you and hunt you down eventually due to ESP hacks. (They also love to sh!t talk in broken English while they kill you)

If you don't die to these people, you're most likely gonna die to people that just kill for sport, so in the long run its just a waste of time, no objective.. just mindlessly killing and eating.

Yes the official servers ""Have No Rules""  BUT that doesn't mean you should be hacking OR ruining the game for others by just making a MEGA PACK of 5 Stegos 5 Crocs and 8 Carnos to run and kill everyone on the Server..

Honestly at the end of the day I do love this game and have met many good friends, maybe I'll reinstall it some day when they fix these issues, but atm its unplayable for me.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I've played that game for quite a while now and I have to admit it's not for everyone.
it does have a lot of bugs but is still a loveable game.

65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"One of the hardest ""Not recommended""s I've ever had to write up. On one hand, the game is unique, tense and fun. But on the other, it is a complete f**king headache to even bother playing or to work up the want to play it. 

In the base game, whatever stupid name you wanna give it. You have to contend with rules, admins and children the likes of which not seen since modern GMod, let alone the whining, crying and other annoying vitriol one puts up with. On top of that, the devs cannot handle criticism and throw bitch fits if someone has a differing opinion than them.

As for EVRIMA or the ""It'll work this time guys"" version:
Imagine spending hours, LITERAL HOURS trying to grow up or find other people so you can chat to someone finally or go for a drink/do something that isn't just wandering aimlessly with nothing in sight but the occasional fish. Now, you finally find others, members of your own species no less, you should be glad right? Wrong, it doesn't matter if you're utahraptor, deinosuchus, even a fucking pteradon. You will be attacked and cannibalized by your own species. Why? Because players are assholes and they've nothing better to do because EVRIMA is empty, and boring. 

TLDR: Great game but expect a lot of wasted time, headaches and dealing with shitters who kill you solely because they can and they were on the server for HOURS before you, meaning they had a day to waste getting big and ready to grief new spawns.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,Haha funny dinosaur game go brrrrr,376210

65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,If a game can be a scam this is it.  The devs are incompetent and never produce updates on time or even the things they promised in the multiple road maps. Instead of improving the game they constantly break it with 'bug fixes' every time something new is introduced.

Save you and your friends money and just get Beasts of Bermuda or Path of Titans.,376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I have 10.8 hours in the game. This was right before envirma was a thing. The game was about a 5/10 at best in *legacy* mode. it was time consuming, empty, and rather boring. I LOVE dinosaurs and this game had a very good down to earth approach to them. There was no objective and most players resorted to creating their own ways to play. now flash forward a few days and envirma comes out. the game is now a 2/10 at best. When envirma launched it took out EVERYthing they worked on and players came to enjoy. It was laggy, unplayable, crashed all the time. and even less things to do and less dinos to play. The art and sound direction are the 2 points this game gets. they have spent so much time and money and resources recreating the game that im sure they will cease production in the coming years.

I got a good 8 hours out of regular of what you could call*fun* 
2 hours into envirma i could realize the ball was dropped and i never picked it up again.

Save your money until the devs put out some real ginormous fixes/changes/improvments.

65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I can play as a Dinosaur? Awesome. And it is, at first. If you can get used to the bugged controls, the wonky hit boxes, atrocious lag and server admins that only seem to care if something directly affects their game.

The links to the discords are almost all broken, which btw, is the only place you'll find the rules for most servers since for some stupid reason they cant put that in this 6 YEAR OLD GAME. So you have it one of two ways. Either take the time, find the discord servers with the rules and get bodied for trying to follow them or ignore them and just hope you dont come across an admin.

The combo of server lag and trash hit boxes can make playing as any carnivore an extreme test of patience in the best scenario and a waste of hours of playtime at the worst. While dying is certainly part of the game, it should be because you've been outplayed or just did something stupid. Not because the game fails to do the literal only thing its actually supposed to do.

I was really excited about this game and I gave it a real shot. If it wasnt several years old Id say give it some time but with a game this age and even the most basic things being broken I dont have much hope.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"Okay. The Isle gives me mixed feelings. I absolutely love the gameplay, and the graphics look insane and run at a low cost even at the highest setting. Its honestly one of my favorite games I've ever played. With the exception of one major thing. The community. I knew and I didn't listen, I thought everyone was pulling my leg. They weren't. In fact they were undermining just how horrible the community, and developers are. I got harassed for about an hour non stop on a sandbox server before finally getting fed up with it enough to ask for help. The admins of the server themselves began catching an attitude with me just wanting to hang out. What the fuck? This wouldn't be an issue with Primal Carnage, a literal PVP death match game? As much as i loved this game growing up, I cant leave a beaming review without properly going over a MAJOR flaw of this game. The fans seem to inherit the developers ""Well even if I can help, I'm too lazy to be bothered to get off my ass and do something about it"" mentality. There's a handful of bugs, and some of the worst people I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. I've met a total of two cool people through this game whereas with BoB and PC:E, I have met countless. Please encourage your players to be more positive to their fellow players, or many just wont have the motivation to play anymore. I might only have 14 hours but that's enough for me to have seen the surface of how toxic the community is.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,Beta branch has not been stable for weeks and it's a new fatal error every update. Feeling like a lot of broken promises and minimal support is the final nail in the coffin.,376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"This game used to be a sandbox in which you picked your favourite dinosaur and sat for a few hours to level up to a fully grown animal before sitting once again but this time surrounded by far smaller animals using you as an insurance policy, and before that was the progression system which, well no. Had the game remained in that state I would likely have voted it down but the new Evrima version of the game (which you can opt into under the Beta tab in properties) is actually very good. There aren't many animals to choose from in this early version of the rework yet it still feels 100x the living and breathing ecosystem that the original version wasn't. In Evrima all of the animals feel like classes with their own strengths, weaknesses and abilities. Evrima's Carnotaurus is a swift but tall pursuit predator that can run exceptionally fast in a straight line but fails to handle turns well, a good way of turning real science into compelling class strengths and weaknesses. The Utahraptor can grasp lunge and pin, as well as being generally very agile, and the newcomers to Evrima the Pteranodon which is the first aerial animal to be properly implemented, and the Deinosuchus which controls fantastically and feels like the most fleshed out of the four despite being one of the newest. The Deinosuchus does have the issue of facing nearly no competition once grown outside of being killed by other Deinosuchus players but this will likely change when the reworks for other animals are finished like the T-rex, and Spinosaurus especially as a rival aquatic class. This game has gone from feeling like an experimental chat room in which people growl at each-other to an actual class-based sandbox game and its genuinely exciting to see what comes next.",376210

That being said, the leadership of the game is an absolute mess to put it politely. Dondi is confused at best and willfully obstinate at worst. His leadership has left this game in purgatory for 5+ years. They went back to square 1 and aren't even anywhere close to what they had before. Sure, there are new mechanics and better animations but the gameplay loop is non-existant (not even nesting or different genders anymore) and the options to choose from are few. The hit boxes are also still questionable at best. The only thing that makes this game fun is when you have friends to play with and you troll other people.

Only devs could use them, and then devs stopped visiting server to show, no, -flaunt- this exclusive feature until the lack of existance. Humans being added? No. Cannibals being added? No. Vicious environments? No (Except for crippling fall damage from cliffs and drowning) Number of dinosaurs available for public use? Reduced. Number of customizable skins? Reduced (Earthy/muted Color palettes in Legacy have shown promise, but there is only 1 skin available and no color changing in Evirma currently)

I feel in the years that have passed by, that the isle has shown very very poor improvement, and I don't expect this game to be better for -several years- at the rate and history that it has shown. 

There was improvement for the first year. After that, it's been a heart break to watch this beast slowly decay and become ruined. The community is divided between people who hate the game and people who can only hope for the best. These two side will viciously attack the other in defense of their opinion. A quick youtube search or a visit to the isle reddit can give you any little bit of research to decide your fate on clicking 'Buy"".

I post this review as a warning. It's fun for a little bit, but for a long term game, set your expectations low. I'll watch updates, but highly not recommend people playing due to slow development, lacking features, and toxic community.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"The first thing to know about The Isle in 2021 is the two separate versions: Legacy and Evirma.

 Legacy is the ""default"" version of the game, and the version most people play. It has lots of dinosaur species and a very active playerbase, AI dinosaurs for carnivores to hunt down, massive well detailed maps dotted with human landmarks, rivers, lakes, mountains, jungles, grasslands and beaches, and two main gamemodes: survival and sandbox. In sandbox, every non-exclusive dinosaur in the game is playable. You start as an adult and basically do whatever you want. This can range from Death Matches to Dino Chatting Rooms. In survival, less species are available but the gameplay is more dynamic. You start as a baby dino, either a juvenile on your own or a hatchling with a mother. As you feed, hunt and survive, you grow in size and strength, becoming faster and more formidable until you become a fully grown adult. It is often necessary to form groups with members of your own species to better the chances of surviving. If you are a female dino, you can have your own young when you become adult (The nesting system allows other players to teleport to you as hatchling dinos, but they are completely dependent on you until they become juveniles.)

So that's what Legacy has to offer. But whats the catch?

Legacy is the abandoned version of The Isle, no longer receiving updates from the devs. As such, it has lots of bugs, ranging from minor annoyances to game breaking glitches such as oversized hitboxes, rubberbanding, FPS drops, disconnections and more. There are also a few ""tricks"" that undermine the basic values of the game, such as tail riding. It can be more than infuriating when you lose your dino to something only describable as bad game design. Food spawns are also fickle. Certain regions of the maps lack AI for carnivores or bushes for herbivores. As such, many players tend to gather around hot spots rather than explore the maps. There are also toxic players who partake in frowned upon behavior such as ""carebearing"" or taking care of dinos that arent your own species, or ""KOSing"" or killing everything in sight for fun.

Now what about Evirma?

Evirma is an entirely new version of The Isle, a complete recode that was started after the Legacy code became too troublesome and frustrating for the dev team to work with. It has a lot of the features that Legacy had with more yet to come, in addition to many exciting new features including an entirely new map, new dinosaurs, reworks of old dinosaurs, new mechanics such as grazing for herbivores, grabbing dragging and swallowing kills for carnivores, new playstyles for unique creatures like pteranodon and deinosuchus, and new systems for food, perks and elder dinosaurs. Everything in Evirma is much more fluent and natural than Legacy, from movement to combat to the ecology of every distinct species. 

The catch?

Evirma is somewhat bare bones as of now, possessing a far smaller dino roster than Legacy. some features like the diet and elder systems have yet to be added, and as usual there are bugs. However, there have been regular patches and bug fixes from the devs, with a roadmap for future large scale updates already planned out.

Overall, The Isle is a very unique take on the survival genre, and a delight for fans of dinosaurs and paleontology. Progress has been slow but steady, and the game already has a lot of promise with its dynamic gameplay. If you love survival games and dinosaurs, this ones for you. If you're more a fan of fast paced games, maybe pass on this one (Growth takes a while :D.)",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"After 1325 Hours of this game I think I can give a decent Review...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEGACY IS DEAD - Not being updated at all and has hardly any player base at least for Australia.

Erivma is Alive - BUT is a toxic pool of Mixpacking Chinese hackers that will find you and hunt you down eventually due to ESP hacks. (They also love to sh!t talk in broken English while they kill you)

If you don't die to these people, you're most likely gonna die to people that just kill for sport, so in the long run its just a waste of time, no objective.. just mindlessly killing and eating.

Yes the official servers ""Have No Rules""  BUT that doesn't mean you should be hacking OR ruining the game for others by just making a MEGA PACK of 5 Stegos 5 Crocs and 8 Carnos to run and kill everyone on the Server..

Honestly at the end of the day I do love this game and have met many good friends, maybe I'll reinstall it some day when they fix these issues, but atm its unplayable for me.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I've played that game for quite a while now and I have to admit it's not for everyone.
it does have a lot of bugs but is still a loveable game.
once you know how to play and use specific dinosaurs it will bring a lot of fun.
at the beginning it will be frustrating but when you find the right people to play with it's going to be a lot of fun^^
may I wish you a happy hunt^^",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,dino born- dino eat- dino die,376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"One of the hardest ""Not recommended""s I've ever had to write up. On one hand, the game is unique, tense and fun. But on the other, it is a complete f**king headache to even bother playing or to work up the want to play it. 

In the base game, whatever stupid name you wanna give it. You have to contend with rules, admins and children the likes of which not seen since modern GMod, let alone the whining, crying and other annoying vitriol one puts up with. On top of that, the devs cannot handle criticism and throw bitch fits if someone has a differing opinion than them.

As for EVRIMA or the ""It'll work this time guys"" version:
Imagine spending hours, LITERAL HOURS trying to grow up or find other people so you can chat to someone finally or go for a drink/do something that isn't just wandering aimlessly with nothing in sight but the occasional fish. Now, you finally find others, members of your own species no less, you should be glad right? Wrong, it doesn't matter if you're utahraptor, deinosuchus, even a fucking pteradon. You will be attacked and cannibalized by your own species. Why? Because players are assholes and they've nothing better to do because EVRIMA is empty, and boring. 

TLDR: Great game but expect a lot of wasted time, headaches and dealing with shitters who kill you solely because they can and they were on the server for HOURS before you, meaning they had a day to waste getting big and ready to grief new spawns.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,Haha funny dinosaur game go brrrrr,376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I do not recommend this game yet, it has so many bugs, almost as many as cyberpunk 2077, the development is super slow, and it's not worth your money right now, maybe in a year or so, cuz they update the game like every two months, and it's not even big updates.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,If a game can be a scam this is it.  The devs are incompetent and never produce updates on time or even the things they promised in the multiple road maps. Instead of improving the game they constantly break it with 'bug fixes' every time something new is introduced. This is the only game I have ever seen actually go BACKWARDS in development and become WORSE than it was before. Save you and your friends money and just get Beasts of Bermuda or Path of Titans.,376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I have 10.8 hours in the game. This was right before envirma was a thing. The game was about a 5/10 at best in *legacy* mode. it was time consuming, empty, and rather boring. I LOVE dinosaurs and this game had a very good down to earth approach to them. There was no objective and most players resorted to creating their own ways to play. now flash forward a few days and envirma comes out. the game is now a 2/10 at best. When envirma launched it took out EVERYthing they worked on and players came to enjoy. It was laggy, unplayable, crashed all the time. and even less things to do and less dinos to play. The art and sound direction are the 2 points this game gets. they have spent so much time and money and resources recreating the game that im sure they will cease production in the coming years.

I got a good 8 hours out of regular of what you could call*fun* 
2 hours into envirma i could realize the ball was dropped and i never picked it up again.

Save your money until the devs put out some real ginormous fixes/changes/improvments.
I really wanted to like the game, but sadly it just wasn't good.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,miarrr,376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"I can play as a Dinosaur? Awesome. And it is, at first. If you can get used to the bugged controls, the wonky hit boxes, atrocious lag and server admins that only seem to care if something directly affects their game.

The links to the discords are almost all broken, which btw, is the only place you'll find the rules for most servers since for some stupid reason they cant put that in this 6 YEAR OLD GAME. So you have it one of two ways. Either take the time, find the discord servers with the rules and get bodied for trying to follow them or ignore them and just hope you dont come across an admin.

The combo of server lag and trash hit boxes can make playing as any carnivore an extreme test of patience in the best scenario and a waste of hours of playtime at the worst. While dying is certainly part of the game, it should be because you've been outplayed or just did something stupid. Not because the game fails to do the literal only thing its actually supposed to do.

I was really excited about this game and I gave it a real shot. If it wasnt several years old Id say give it some time but with a game this age and even the most basic things being broken I dont have much hope.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"Okay. The Isle gives me mixed feelings. I absolutely love the gameplay, and the graphics look insane and run at a low cost even at the highest setting. Its honestly one of my favorite games I've ever played. With the exception of one major thing. The community. I knew and I didn't listen, I thought everyone was pulling my leg. They weren't. In fact they were undermining just how horrible the community, and developers are. I got harassed for about an hour non stop on a sandbox server before finally getting fed up with it enough to ask for help. The admins of the server themselves began catching an attitude with me just wanting to hang out. What the fuck? This wouldn't be an issue with Primal Carnage, a literal PVP death match game? As much as i loved this game growing up, I cant leave a beaming review without properly going over a MAJOR flaw of this game. The fans seem to inherit the developers ""Well even if I can help, I'm too lazy to be bothered to get off my ass and do something about it"" mentality. There's a handful of bugs, and some of the worst people I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. I've met a total of two cool people through this game whereas with BoB and PC:E, I have met countless. Please encourage your players to be more positive to their fellow players, or many just wont have the motivation to play anymore. I might only have 14 hours but that's enough for me to have seen the surface of how toxic the community is.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,Beta branch has not been stable for weeks and it's a new fatal error every update. Feeling like a lot of broken promises and minimal support is the final nail in the coffin.,376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"This game used to be a sandbox in which you picked your favourite dinosaur and sat for a few hours to level up to a fully grown animal before sitting once again but this time surrounded by far smaller animals using you as an insurance policy, and before that was the progression system which, well no. Had the game remained in that state I would likely have voted it down but the new Evrima version of the game (which you can opt into under the Beta tab in properties) is actually very good. There aren't many animals to choose from in this early version of the rework yet it still feels 100x the living and breathing ecosystem that the original version wasn't. In Evrima all of the animals feel like classes with their own strengths, weaknesses and abilities. Evrima's Carnotaurus is a swift but tall pursuit predator that can run exceptionally fast in a straight line but fails to handle turns well, a good way of turning real science into compelling class strengths and weaknesses. The Utahraptor can grasp lunge and pin, as well as being generally very agile, and the newcomers to Evrima the Pteranodon which is the first aerial animal to be properly implemented, and the Deinosuchus which controls fantastically and feels like the most fleshed out of the four despite being one of the newest. The Deinosuchus does have the issue of facing nearly no competition once grown outside of being killed by other Deinosuchus players but this will likely change when the reworks for other animals are finished like the T-rex, and Spinosaurus especially as a rival aquatic class. This game has gone from feeling like an experimental chat room in which people growl at each-other to an actual class-based sandbox game and its genuinely exciting to see what comes next.",376210

65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"It's a very fun game, but people cannibalizing their own kind for no reason is rampant and takes the fun out of the game. Imagine being a spinosaurus hatchling for hours, just drinking and eating, and when you're finally almost medium size mama logs off and a random group member kills you for no reason. There NEED to be HUGE debuffs for cannibalizing your own, and I will not recommend this game until it has been fixed.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"The game is gorgeous, the animations are superb, and the sound design is leagues ahead of any other immersive game I can think of besides Subnautica. That being said, the leadership of the game is an absolute mess to put it politely. Dondi is confused at best and willfully obstinate at worst. His leadership has left this game in purgatory for 5+ years. They went back to square 1 and aren't even anywhere close to what they had before. Sure, there are new mechanics and better animations but the gameplay loop is non-existant (not even nesting or different genders anymore) and the options to choose from are few. The hit boxes are also still questionable at best. The only thing that makes this game fun is when you have friends to play with and you troll other people. Maybe if the game ever gets done I can recommend it but if you pay anything over 5 bucks then it's a ripoff.",376210
65,The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"Bought this game on sale. I could not make a private server. It loaded into a black screen. Asked the community about it and according to them, you need to turn your settings down and if that doesn't work, you are one of the people who can't play singleplayer due to a bug that has been known for years. Uhh ok? So attempted to join a server. Couldn't join any servers despite my graphics being turned down low (I have a beast of a computer anyway). I just got stuck on 11% in the loading screen on all servers. Again. A known bug that has existed for TWO YEARS. What the hell kind of dev priorities are those? How long can a game be in ""early access"" with such aggregious bugs like that? Just call the game what it is, unfinished and soon to be obsolete since they can't come out with fast fixes like POT is doing. I reccommend checking out what POT is up to instead because their devs are very active. Refund on The Isle requested.",376210

66,DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,454650,"Very Very fun Dragon Ball game in general, super addictive, been playing since beta of first Xenoverse game and can't tell you how many times I've repurchased the dlc for different platforms. But there is always going to be one thing that holds this game back and that's the fact that once in a blue moon you'll find someone playing something PvE wise online. I still actively play this and, be still my heart, get excited unlocking something for a character that people have had for a long time. This game used to be so exciting whenever the PvE scene was as active as the PvP scene and even in that category it's filled with cheesers who abuse namekian grabs and CC chain lock abilities making it unfun as well. Hoping that in this next expansion this game will see some light and hopefully as well get some community love. But until then, if you're a first time buyer, I would not recommend unless you have some friends to play with who will be just as active as you are due to the pricing. So if you're looking for help in grinding something or wanting to do things in PvE, feel free to add me and message me and I would gladly come and participate!",454650
66,DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,454650,"TL;DR: The game is fun if you are a dragon ball fan, but I'd play it with friends if you can. Also, wait for sales if you care about the dlc, otherwise play it for what it's worth. 

I've played this game so much across so many platforms that I can tell you pretty much anything about this game.
I will tell you outright that you will only enjoy this game if you are a fairly big fan of dragon ball. Even then, the game will absolutely test your patience at times. There are straight up BAD parts of this game. That being said, because I am a gigantic dragon ball fan I absolutely love it. 

If you're looking to scratch that itch of playing a dragon ball game that feels similar to games from the budokai tenkaichi or raging blast series' then this is the game. It's not really all that complex to play, but you feel like you're a dragon ball character (which is especially cool since you get to make your own character as well). It's not really a *fighting* game, so don't expect FighterZ level complexity (also a dope game). 

The main draw this game has on me (besides being a dragon ball game) is honestly being able to play with friends. It has plenty of PVE stuff for you to do in the form of the hundred or so parallel quests (which can also be added to with dlc). It's got that large character roster that you'd expect from the aforementioned games (though the characters also aren't all 100% unique).

The biggest negative from this game is more so the business side instead of the game side. The game is expensive as fuck. It's 5 years old still basically full priced, and it contains so many dlc packs that enhance the life of the game. If you want EVERYTHING the game can offer, the dlc is *kind of* necessary. I say it's kind of necessary because at a point you just become so damn strong that most of the missions become chump change, and the dlc quests that are added are notoriously hard as dicks. You can pass on the dlc if you don't really care about any of the characters they add/want new missions. If you want the COMPLETE game, I highly suggest waiting until the game is under $10 with special pricing on the dlc. I bought the game as gift for a friend recently and with EVERYTHING it was about the same price as the base game normally is. 

The other really annoying business side of the game is that it does have some F2P game mechanics. There is an in-game currency that allows to get clothes, skills, etc. You don't have to pay any of it, but I find it frustrating that they have these predatory business practices in a game that you could very well be paying over $100 for (base game and all the dlc packs.)

Overall, it's a game I find myself getting sucked back into time and time again. 

Plus, you can dress up as Mr. Satan while being a SSJB shooting a big bang attack, and I think there's something beautiful about that.

66,DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2,Massively%20Multiplayer,454650,"TL;DR: The game is fun if you are a dragon ball fan, but I'd play it with friends if you can. Also, wait for sales if you care about the dlc, otherwise play it for what it's worth. 

I've played this game so much across so many platforms that I can tell you pretty much anything about this game.
I will tell you outright that you will only enjoy this game if you are a fairly big fan of dragon ball. Even then, the game will absolutely test your patience at times. There are straight up BAD parts of this game. That being said, because I am a gigantic dragon ball fan I absolutely love it. 

If you're looking to scratch that itch of playing a dragon ball game that feels similar to games from the budokai tenkaichi or raging blast series' then this is the game. It's not really all that complex to play, but you feel like you're a dragon ball character (which is especially cool since you get to make your own character as well). It's not really a *fighting* game, so don't expect FighterZ level complexity (also a dope game). 

The main draw this game has on me (besides being a dragon ball game) is honestly being able to play with friends. It has plenty of PVE stuff for you to do in the form of the hundred or so parallel quests (which can also be added to with dlc). It's got that large character roster that you'd expect from the aforementioned games (though the characters also aren't all 100% unique).

The biggest negative from this game is more so the business side instead of the game side. The game is expensive as fuck. It's 5 years old still basically full priced, and it contains so many dlc packs that enhance the life of the game. If you want EVERYTHING the game can offer, the dlc is *kind of* necessary. I say it's kind of necessary because at a point you just become so damn strong that most of the missions become chump change, and the dlc quests that are added are notoriously hard as dicks. You can pass on the dlc if you don't really care about any of the characters they add/want new missions. If you want the COMPLETE game, I highly suggest waiting until the game is under $10 with special pricing on the dlc. I bought the game as gift for a friend recently and with EVERYTHING it was about the same price as the base game normally is. 

The other really annoying business side of the game is that it does have some F2P game mechanics. There is an in-game currency that allows to get clothes, skills, etc. You don't have to pay any of it, but I find it frustrating that they have these predatory business practices in a game that you could very well be paying over $100 for (base game and all the dlc packs.)

Overall, it's a game I find myself getting sucked back into time and time again. 

Plus, you can dress up as Mr. Satan while being a SSJB shooting a big bang attack, and I think there's something beautiful about that.

It's awesome that there's no addon reliance but they addressed quality of life stuff so that the usual grind for gear is not as bad.  Standard high level gear drops will be good enough unless you are really wanting to do 8 or 16 man groups and the hardest modes of each then you will need to chase the monkey some but if find a guild that's active in those areas it's not too bad. But it's the Star Wars universe yes it's 3000 years before the movies but you are walking/running thru the same places  as your movie characters just at a different time.

68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"First major concern a lot of people have about LOTRO - is it dead?

No. It still has a very healthy playerbase, big enough that the even the RP servers feel populated. So don't let your worries about population turn you away.

This is a classic MMORPG. It's going to be familiar to anyone that has played Everquest, DAoC, WoW, etc. While it means you're not getting any particularly amazing new mechanics, the perk is that LOTRO has figured out how to get the best out of those systems. Leveling feels well-progressed, classes are (mostly) balanced, and there is a lot of variety even within the classes to provide lots of replay value and ways to mitigate strengths and weaknesses.

LOTRO might have the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I recommend turning off battle music and just enjoying the compositions. Bree, as well as the various Inns and Halls located therein, have some fantastic scores attached to them.

Let's be honest though - if you play LOTRO you're probably here because it's Lord of the Rings. And in that regard, you will not be disappointed. The game is steeped in the lore - books and films - and has little nods to it scattered everywhere that are rewarding for someone that is really into their Tolkien scholarship. This is not a LotR skin thrown over a MMORPG framework - this is Middle Earth proper. Even with dated graphics (updates are coming soon, as of this writing) it's still a joy to look at. If you're rolling through some place like the Shire, you'll be able to soak in that sleepy, bucolic atmosphere that the movies portrayed so well.

This is a great MMO experience, and I usually find MMOs tedious. Moreover, it's free - so your excuses to at least try it out are non-existent.",212500

It's free-to-play but there is content blocked by a pay wall. Technically, you can get past the pay wall by just playing the game but it's a monotonous grind. I listen to the ""LOTRO Podcast"" while playing this game and it's really relaxing. Overall, highly recommended.",212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"This is probably one of my favorite things to review...as you can tell by my hours..198.8 hours total, BUT I have 64.9 Hours just in two weeks, thats how addicting this game can be, that is with no sitting around, no afking or etc..it's a very fun game..But with the fanboying aside lets get to what you guys came for and give my Pros and Cons

Pros:
Great Community (very helpful no matter what server your on)
Beautiful Atmosphere
Never breaks the tolkien universe feeling (which means always feels like your really in the Tolkien Universe) 
Great Variety in Weapons, skill sets, and armors, you will rarely find someone with the same kind of armor and or weapon as you or even close for that matter
Very Unique in its own way, personally I love the cosmetic system, it adds this feeling to kind of drive you into the universe more so you can kinda be more in character, feel like your there (Cosmetic system, allows you to equip armor and weapons that you would personally think suits you, so for man it would be ranger armor and etc, dwarves heavy dwarven armor and etc...Personally it a great feature as it gives a better feeling to it) 
Teams still working on the game, making it much better with every update!
Added a new race called Beorning with the class (their like druids, for WoW players you turn into a bear pretty much lol) But also hard to get on free to play..but possible!
Has own servers for Roleplayers (so if your into kind of the Tolkien universe for LOTR that you know a lot about roleplaying and stuff give it a shot, people are very forgiving on Laurelin (the EU and US RP server) along with other servers as well.
Has some wonderfu crafting mechanics that could very much benefit you if you are in a Kinship (kind of like a clan) you can help each other have the gear you need to FIGHT For middle earth!

Cons:
Sadly, helps the VIP a lot, with all expansions and etc unlocked
F2P's have to ""farm"" all their points in order to level
F2P's have a huge grind
Sometimes you could be looked down upon from being a f2p by VIP's (more my personal experience but still, something to be careful about)
Time Consuming farming (not too much of a complaint as that's how its suppose to be XD)
Graphics for character are out of date (expected of course from 2009)
Some areas can be depressing yes, but that DOESN'T mean its still not beautiful, you could be taken away by the beautiful areas around Angmar, or the huge mountains in Moria or just in the Misty Mountains great places to go (harder to get to if your F2P, trust me..I farmed the points, tough but worth it) 

These are of course my personal Pros and Cons, as you would expect, but most of them were based off of other people's reactions to the game and stuff like that, so it is not just me spewing a bunch of stuff out for someone to read :P I hoped you loved the review, and trust me I'd gladly give it a 10/10 course it has its flaws but it is still beautiful, fun, and interesting.

And always remember....Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! (which means...Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!) Sorry i'm a dwarf Junkie myself! :P I love dwarves and their history in the Tolkien universe.",212500

68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"10 years and still fascinating millions of people world wide. Lotro is right behind WoW and Everquest in long time popularity. For good reasons. The community loves Tolkiens world and they treat eachother with respect and open arms. The most important game in my long history of gaming - an MMO legend you should not miss if you are interested in Middle Earth and its tales. What Peter JAckson did for the books in the movie world, Turbine the developer did for the gaming world. A beautiful and surprisingly accurate depiction of the books and scriptures of JRR Tolkien. A timeless Art Direction makes the game still look relevant today. 
Join the greatest Fantasy Universe ever imagined.",212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Lotro's graphics maybe somewhat dated at the moment and mechanically it does not stand out to much from other mmos using the same model, but the game does justice to the breadth and scope of Middle Earth and Tolkien's deep lore.

As an MMO, it is one of the best ones out. It is certainly more geared to solo players, but does a good job of catering to everyone. The classes range from basic to some of the most advanced and interesting classes I've ever seen in an MMO. (Take Warden or LoreMaster for example)! The community is also one of the friendliest and the servers are still busy and alive to this day. It has stood the test of time and still looks astonishingly beautiful as ever. Add to all that it has fantastic mood setting music you've got a class A product. Many players simply can't stop at a single character and over the years I have kept on coming back to this game. Without a doubt my favourite MMO ever. It's also great to see the dedication of Standing Stone in keeping their work alive and keeping lotro safe for the future years with a decent, not overly greedy free to play system. Much of the content can be enjoyed for free and extras can be bought as required. The only time you may consider spending money is to open up quest packs in different regions and expansion packs.

But the main storyline is very interesting and, most importantly, it very closely intersects with the plot of the books ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit."" We will meet a lot of familiar characters, take part in familiar events and how to properly ponostalgiruem.

I will make a reservation that this video passage was created in order to consider the plot of the game and compare it with the books ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"", and not run through the whole game, skipping past the description of the quests and doing endless shooting of monsters.

68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I have been playing this game from Alpha stage, granted it is older graphics but not the worst out there. Many many hours of gameplay to be head with fantastic content if your a fan of the Movies, Books, etc. then give it a try. I personally love the game and the community is one of the best I have seen.",212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I love to play this game just to unwind and take in the scenary of Middle-Earth. It's a great game to play with friends or also alone. It's free-to-play but there is content blocked by a pay wall. Technically, you can get past the pay wall by just playing the game but it's a monotonous grind. I listen to the ""LOTRO Podcast"" while playing this game and it's really relaxing. Overall, highly recommended.",212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"This is probably one of my favorite things to review...as you can tell by my hours..198.8 hours total, BUT I have 64.9 Hours just in two weeks, thats how addicting this game can be, that is with no sitting around, no afking or etc..it's a very fun game..But with the fanboying aside lets get to what you guys came for and give my Pros and Cons

Pros:
Great Community (very helpful no matter what server your on)
Beautiful Atmosphere
Never breaks the tolkien universe feeling (which means always feels like your really in the Tolkien Universe) 
Great Variety in Weapons, skill sets, and armors, you will rarely find someone with the same kind of armor and or weapon as you or even close for that matter
Very Unique in its own way, personally I love the cosmetic system, it adds this feeling to kind of drive you into the universe more so you can kinda be more in character, feel like your there (Cosmetic system, allows you to equip armor and weapons that you would personally think suits you, so for man it would be ranger armor and etc, dwarves heavy dwarven armor and etc...Personally it a great feature as it gives a better feeling to it) 
Teams still working on the game, making it much better with every update!
Added a new race called Beorning with the class (their like druids, for WoW players you turn into a bear pretty much lol) But also hard to get on free to play..but possible!
Has own servers for Roleplayers (so if your into kind of the Tolkien universe for LOTR that you know a lot about roleplaying and stuff give it a shot, people are very forgiving on Laurelin (the EU and US RP server) along with other servers as well.
Has some wonderfu crafting mechanics that could very much benefit you if you are in a Kinship (kind of like a clan) you can help each other have the gear you need to FIGHT For middle earth!

Cons:
Sadly, helps the VIP a lot, with all expansions and etc unlocked
F2P's have to ""farm"" all their points in order to level
F2P's have a huge grind
Sometimes you could be looked down upon from being a f2p by VIP's (more my personal experience but still, something to be careful about)
Time Consuming farming (not too much of a complaint as that's how its suppose to be XD)
Graphics for character are out of date (expected of course from 2009)
Some areas can be depressing yes, but that DOESN'T mean its still not beautiful, you could be taken away by the beautiful areas around Angmar, or the huge mountains in Moria or just in the Misty Mountains great places to go (harder to get to if your F2P, trust me..I farmed the points, tough but worth it) 

These are of course my personal Pros and Cons, as you would expect, but most of them were based off of other people's reactions to the game and stuff like that, so it is not just me spewing a bunch of stuff out for someone to read :P I hoped you loved the review, and trust me I'd gladly give it a 10/10 course it has its flaws but it is still beautiful, fun, and interesting.

And always remember....Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! (which means...Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!) Sorry i'm a dwarf Junkie myself! :P I love dwarves and their history in the Tolkien universe.",212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"to steam dev.
the downloadable content from steam is too outdated, please update your  game, so steam dont refuse our updated version and delete it then try to re-download the outdated content from your servers",212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"10 years and still fascinating millions of people world wide. Lotro is right behind WoW and Everquest in long time popularity. For good reasons. The community loves Tolkiens world and they treat eachother with respect and open arms. The most important game in my long history of gaming - an MMO legend you should not miss if you are interested in Middle Earth and its tales. What Peter JAckson did for the books in the movie world, Turbine the developer did for the gaming world. A beautiful and surprisingly accurate depiction of the books and scriptures of JRR Tolkien. A timeless Art Direction makes the game still look relevant today. 
Join the greatest Fantasy Universe ever imagined.",212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Lotro's graphics maybe somewhat dated at the moment and mechanically it does not stand out to much from other mmos using the same model, but the game does justice to the breadth and scope of Middle Earth and Tolkien's deep lore. I recommend this game to people who value small ambient touches in a game over wow factor and of course to any readers of the Professor.",212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,Great MMO that's actually totally F2P if you don't mind farming special currency.,212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"If you're a Tolkien fan, you should love this. It's a lot of fun seeing how much care and attention has gone into recreating the world of middle earth. 
As an MMO, it is one of the best ones out. It is certainly more geared to solo players, but does a good job of catering to everyone. The classes range from basic to some of the most advanced and interesting classes I've ever seen in an MMO. (Take Warden or LoreMaster for example)! The community is also one of the friendliest and the servers are still busy and alive to this day. It has stood the test of time and still looks astonishingly beautiful as ever. Add to all that it has fantastic mood setting music you've got a class A product. Many players simply can't stop at a single character and over the years I have kept on coming back to this game. Without a doubt my favourite MMO ever. It's also great to see the dedication of Standing Stone in keeping their work alive and keeping lotro safe for the future years with a decent, not overly greedy free to play system. Much of the content can be enjoyed for free and extras can be bought as required. The only time you may consider spending money is to open up quest packs in different regions and expansion packs. But considering the size and amount of time you could foreseeably spend in this masterpiece, it is well worth it!",212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"My playtime should say enough.
",212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"I present you the video passage of the game Lord of the Rings Online, more precisely, its main storyline, which is here proudly called ""epic"". Numerous side quests scattered throughout Middle-earth will not enter this passage, since for the most part they are tasks like ""kill 5 goblins"" or ""bring 10 wolf tails"" and, with rare exceptions, are not worthy of our attention. But the main storyline is very interesting and, most importantly, it very closely intersects with the plot of the books ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit."" We will meet a lot of familiar characters, take part in familiar events and how to properly ponostalgiruem.

I will make a reservation that this video passage was created in order to consider the plot of the game and compare it with the books ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"", and not run through the whole game, skipping past the description of the quests and doing endless shooting of monsters. Passage does not carry the main purpose of suggesting something to the players (although not without this, of course). Here, rather nostalgia, combined with the analysis of the plot and its connection with the original, untouched universe.",212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Fun game, although you feel kinda left out if you don't pay money into the game. It's not impossible to progress without money, but the game askes for it a lot. 

It's kinda a fun game without money, but recommened playing with friends or else it gets boring fast.

It has skill trees which is always fun in games. Archer is OP in 1v1's late game, I reccomened though!",212500
68,The Lord of the Rings Online™,Massively%20Multiplayer,212500,"Best mmo and best gaming community I have ever encountered, how old the game is doesn't make it look bad at all, it makes it feel kind of special. Only bad thing is that the game has a bad tutorial. It is free to play but there is dlc.  U can buy them with a very rare in-game currency that takes a long time to get but most people buy most of them. PvP is Like no other game and amazing. U can play as orcs and spiders or the free people of middle earth, there is a big PvP region where there are out posts to capture that give buffs, castles that if defeated join your faction and give you quests, and an entire secret underground world filled with bosses, not to mention towns and mines to do quests and farm so u never even have to fight another player if you don't want to. You are going to want to work in groups of at least two though to survive, especially if u are low rank because there are high levels from the other faction roaming and npcs meant to fight groups of people.",212500

69,Assetto Corsa,Racing,244210,"U want a honest review?

First let me start by saying i have played this sim/racing game on another account that i completely forgot about that has 1500hrs on it easily, sooo yea i have 4000hrs in this and yes i have played this since it first came out(i have time to kill im retired basically).

Lets talk about stock AC (Assetto Corsa) by today's standards, mind you this sim is almost 8yrs old 
 
8/10
-Plenty of cars and tracks to choose from so u can have fun at a nice price, goes on sell quite often (after you have setup your wheel and pedals properly or with controller or keyboard, AND get your FOV dialed in) 

-U can get good/great fps even on a somewhat dated pc until u decide to do something crazy like race on the Nordschleife with every ai u can possibly fit or try VR

-Graphics, well its age shows right there :whooze: 

-Physics, does just fine though some cars do feel extremely glued to the road or have broken aerodynamics or just drive like bricks ( so if u think ur going to just get in a Mclaren P1 and do some drifts like u seen on a few yt videos... well best of luck), but hey nothing is perfect especially something this old still does better than games like gts or pc2-3 imo
 
Now for the modded version of AC
 
MY GOD the modded community has done a number on this sim and for the better  

 10/10 ( if i get the right content )
-Between SOL(weather update), CSP (Custom Shaders Patch), CM (Content Manger), PPF (PostProcessingFilters) this sim looks like it belongs in a game trailer from this year, dont believe me? Just go inside the Screenshot channels of a DECENT AC discord server and look.

-There (i cant express this enough) are good and great mods and then there are bad and terrible mods be it tracks or cars etc, im not going to get into detail about because it would take forever to explain but to put it as short as possible there are some mods that look and drive worse than stock AC and there are mods that are just so much fun and everything feels natural u can get lost in this sim for hrs and hrs, just ask around in a DECENT AC discord server or go to RaceDepartment 

Yes i would recommend this sim to anyone that has a love/ passion for cars but try not get too involved with the some of community, odds are you'll end up in argument with kids or adults who should honestly get off and get a job.",244210

69,Assetto Corsa,Racing,244210,"The world isn't ready for the tyre physics. More playable on a keyboard than other driving simulators. A steering wheel & pedals makes it easier, and quality force-feedback makes it easier still.

You can't drive at full speed, tap brake, and steer like NFS. The game is about finding braking points, turn in point, smoothly braking & accelerating. Trail-braking works. It's difficult to find the braking & turn-in points with a small screen/non-VR, and it's difficult to know when the car is understeering without force-feedback. So it's difficult to go fast.

Nearly every sports car & track has been modded for the game to a high standard.",244210
69,Assetto Corsa,Racing,244210,"Seems like they spent all the time on the cars themselves, and no time anywhere else. Races feel bland and bare-bones, setting one up feels like a chore and it, just doesn't feel fun. Like at all.",244210
69,Assetto Corsa,Racing,244210,"Cruising down on the Wangan street with JDM cars for fun with the bois certainly made Assetto Corsa one of the greatest and enjoyable game with its wide mods support.

Assetto Corsa has an active modding community that still provides players with fresh content regularly. As with any mods, some are amazing whilst others are of questionable quality, but one thing’s for sure, you aren’t going to run out of new things to try any time soon. One mod I particularly enjoy adds an excellent recreation of the Wangan - C1 Street racing with JDM cars by Shutoko Revival Project 2.0, adding in the entire field of cars and their various liveries. It’s just one example of the fantastic work the Assetto Corsa community has produced.

These mods can add your favourite cars to the game or even just throw a new livery onto an existing favourite of yours. And with the game offering good support for mods, both for creators and players, you don’t need to worry about modding being too difficult to be accessible. The majority of mods are as simple as downloading the content then dragging and dropping the files into your game folder, meaning you can find a mod on a site like RaceDepartment and in a matter of minutes, be flying around the track in your new car.

So now you’ve heard me sing the game’s praises, I think it’s pretty obvious that I think Assetto Corsa is worth picking up in 2021. The driving experience it provides and the wealth of content available from the modding community give you an endlessly enjoyable game that you can sink hours into. And with Assetto Corsa Competizione focusing solely on GT racing rather than offering the variety of the original, much of what Assetto Corsa has to offer can’t be found in the newer release.


So whilst the Ultimate Edition may feel a tad pricey for a six-year-old game, it’s well worth picking up if sim-racing is something you enjoy or want to get into. Not to mention the fact that it goes on sale in nearly every Steam sale there is for more than half price. So with the Steam Summer Sale coming up this June you won’t even have to wait that long to grab it for a good price.",244210

I totally agree on what PervasivePeach ⁧⁧♡ says here, on 1 track i find winning the race with 20 seconds between me and the 2nd guy and the other race i find myself on the 16th place

72,The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"I'm only 2 hours in and it feels like I've experienced all the interesting aspects of the game already. Worth $5 sure. Anything more than that, probably not.

Pros:
- your airplane can transform into a car and fall out of the sky
- they got rid of a lot of the story from the first Crew game and get you into the action arguably quicker
- gameplay is smoother than the original (fewer buggy connection issues)

Cons:
- there are still annoying cut scenes and a half baked story
- the world is not as memorable or interesting as the first game 
- the terrain and weather was a lot more interesting in the original
- there's not much to do outside of the key spots spread out over the map
- they got rid of the whole cops chasing you concept when you cause destruction (although it is less annoying when you're trying to do something)
- all of the cars feel the same (driving off road with a Miata feels nearly the same as an offroad dune buggy)
- exploration is boring compared to similar games

Recommend playing the original instead. If you don't like story, try Forza Horizon or Burnout Paradise. All of them are much more enjoyable and interesting to just drive around in the world, in addition to being more fun when you do get into the action.",646910
72,The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"game doesnt live up the hype.Ive played the game after reviewing so i can confidently say that the game has the alt tab bug,the keyboard controller switch bug and the random game crash bug.Graphic and Grindwise game looks good.Dont buy  the game unless it goes for like 6 bucks at max.",646910
72,The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"Ok. I had a lot of fun cruising alone over the wide roads of the map. I also like the design and the sound of the vehicles some times. Game is not too buggy and you can do some races even with friends together.

But every single event is only there to generate even more revenue for the producers. The worst thing is that it's only about milking the remaining players dry, because you still have to pay for the new events to be able to collect the rewards at all. In addition, it is also very expensive. Even worse is once you have bought the ""access"", you have to fulfill certain orders so that you can get the rewards at all and the orders are boring to compete and only serve the players to stay in the game. It takes hoursssss to fullfill the orders. I just played 1hr (6 races) and I didn't get any reward through the leveling system from the event. The event also ends in like 39 days. I assume that I'm gonna lose the ability to get the rewards.
 
But look at that, you can also buy the orders with real money so you can get the rewards. Very original Ubis... Well done, I'm proud. Just like any other event which you released so far. These aren't rewards anymore, they're crappy expensive skins.",646910

72,The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"I'm only 2 hours in and it feels like I've experienced all the interesting aspects of the game already. Worth $5 sure. Anything more than that, probably not.

Pros:
- your airplane can transform into a car and fall out of the sky
- they got rid of a lot of the story from the first Crew game and get you into the action arguably quicker
- gameplay is smoother than the original (fewer buggy connection issues)

Cons:
- there are still annoying cut scenes and a half baked story
- the world is not as memorable or interesting as the first game 
- the terrain and weather was a lot more interesting in the original
- there's not much to do outside of the key spots spread out over the map
- they got rid of the whole cops chasing you concept when you cause destruction (although it is less annoying when you're trying to do something)
- all of the cars feel the same (driving off road with a Miata feels nearly the same as an offroad dune buggy)
- exploration is boring compared to similar games

Recommend playing the original instead. If you don't like story, try Forza Horizon or Burnout Paradise. All of them are much more enjoyable and interesting to just drive around in the world, in addition to being more fun when you do get into the action.",646910
72,The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"game doesnt live up the hype.Ive played the game after reviewing so i can confidently say that the game has the alt tab bug,the keyboard controller switch bug and the random game crash bug.Graphic and Grindwise game looks good.Dont buy  the game unless it goes for like 6 bucks at max.",646910
72,The Crew™ 2,Racing,646910,"Ok. I had a lot of fun cruising alone over the wide roads of the map. I also like the design and the sound of the vehicles some times. Game is not too buggy and you can do some races even with friends together.

But every single event is only there to generate even more revenue for the producers. The worst thing is that it's only about milking the remaining players dry, because you still have to pay for the new events to be able to collect the rewards at all. In addition, it is also very expensive. Even worse is once you have bought the ""access"", you have to fulfill certain orders so that you can get the rewards at all and the orders are boring to compete and only serve the players to stay in the game. It takes hoursssss to fullfill the orders. I just played 1hr (6 races) and I didn't get any reward through the leveling system from the event. The event also ends in like 39 days. I assume that I'm gonna lose the ability to get the rewards.
 
But look at that, you can also buy the orders with real money so you can get the rewards. Very original Ubis... Well done, I'm proud. Just like any other event which you released so far. These aren't rewards anymore, they're crappy expensive skins.",646910

jumps feel like they're made of ice for some reason and love to shoot you off to side so minor corrections are very difficult to make last second.
 Pumping is such an integral skill to have and use in this game yet its rarely mentioned and there's almost no consistent way to practice this skill without mods, also its quite difficult to determine whether or not your pumping correctly since the game gives no indication besides a speed increase ( an audio que could somewhat fix this) and there's no real tutorial on doing it from what i have seen.

It is a game simple in premise and execution, it is easy to pick up and get going but there is a lot to master as well and a high skill ceiling. However, due to lack of focus the game becomes a conflicted mess once you think about it.

[h2]Pros:[/h2]
[List]
[*][b]Excellent controls - [/b]Simple and effective, they are not too tight and not too loose. Steering is challenging at high speeds but not impossible.
[*][b]Sense of speed - [/b]I cannot remember any other game with such a great sense of speed. You accelerate quickly and moving fast is exhilarating. And when you are able to thread the needle it is so satisfying.
[*][b]Procedural generation - [/b]Basically an infinite amount of tracks. There is also a lot of variety because of it and the fact that there are 8 distinct biomes with different hazards and features.
[/List]

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
[List]
[*][b]It does not know what it wants from you - [/b]You start playing and naturally you follow the track downhill. Going as fast as possible towards the finish line is very fun. But soon you realize that you can go off track and ignore the preset track, and then you realize that there is no good incentive to go fast and that the best way to reach the goal reliably is to crawl down at a snail's pace. All that matters is that you do not crash, nothing else is important. I made it to the end just by slowly rolling downhill and pressing the breaks constantly. I think the idea is that there are many intended ways of playing e.g. going fast, doing stunts, drifting or going off-road. And by making all of those options viable that failed to make it worthwhile adhering to either style.
[*][b]Roughlike structure - [/b]Each run you make it through one or more maps of connected nodes that represent a track. They have different stats and modifiers but since going slow is the way to go, nothing matters. What playing risky can give you are extra lives and crewmembers. I might suck, but going for extra lives is often more risky than just ignoring the challenge and descent safely. Losing a life trying to gain one is a zero sum game at best. Crewmembers give extremely niche or minor bonuses that do not impact gameplay in any meaningful way. 
[*][b]Overworld map - [/b]There is no incentive to not just take the shortest path towards the map exit making the majority of each overworld map superfluous. Playing more maps are just more opportunities to mess up and lose lives. And apparently if you play too many maps the sun sets and you have to ride in the dark, but this NEVER happened to me and I never saw any reason to play more tracks than absolutely necessary.

75,DiRT Rally 2.0,Sports,690790,"MAIN GAME -     DiRT Rally 2.0 is one of if not the best racing experiences it is perfect in almost every way the only down side of this game is driving on asphalt however it isn't the main focus of the game play everything from the car selection to the track selections is immaculate. VR support makes this game all the better if you have any VR headset what so ever i recommend playing with it even if you don't have a racing wheel just for the absolute immersion it causes. Career mode is perhaps one of the most challenging and rewarding modes of any game i have ever played and the progression system of the game gives you time to learn while also pushing you to your limits.

COLIN MCRAE DLC-      DiRT Rally 2.0's Colin McRae DLC is one that represents Colins racing career without being insensitive to his early death it is fun and adds a sense of campaign that wasn't present in the in the original game aside from the historic races.",690790

I have lost several hours of hard won racing because the game crashed and they reset my championships...  when I contacted customer service, they were basically like, yeah, fuck you, nothing we can do about it!  I have had to re-do so many things at no fault of my own its crazy.  Also, they are selling tracks from dirt rally 1 as DLC.  So I would have to pay twice for a map I already supported the development of.  I'll continue playing because I already own the game and I think the driving experience is good, but overall thumbs down and would not recommend to others",690790

Not only you will lose all your possible earnings you will also lose your hard-earned credits to repair the car you just trashed. This game will make you realise the difference between analog and digital input as you floor the gas on a Porsche. A racing game where if you finish in the top 1000’s you are a great player.,690790

It immediately made projects cars 2 feel like a very slow toy.  i still like project cars 1 but 2 definitely just doesn't have that special something that makes me want to come back. It definitely does not have the speed immersion that Assetto or PCars 1 has.  So I give a thumbs down. Let's be real here. If you spend a lot on a wheel you will want the best experience right?

When European sports cars were imported in the 80's, they had to be modified to meet U.S. safety regulations, as a kid I got to see my dream cars first hand.  It only made sense that I would be a race car driver. As it turned out, race cars are really expensive, even the crapy ones, and it only takes one high speed wreck to alter your life, so I pulled a Joe Dirt. Recently I got into race sims and pretty much obtained or purchased just about every one, and PC2 is hands down my favorite. Some of the racing games take the realism to a point where It's not really fun,  or the other end of the spectrum, it's like playing rad racer on NES. Project Cars 1 and 2 is in that perfect medium where it's not so realistic its like work, but not so unrealistic that its mind-numbing.

I need to switch USB ports multiple times, connect the wheel via a USB hub instead of connecting directly to a USB port on my PC, reboot, or try some other method to get Project Cars 2 to detect my wheel inputs. Every other racing /sim game I have works perfectly fine with my wheel. Because of these issues, it frequently takes me 30-45 minutes of set up every time just to play this game. I'm honestly surprised that a popular sim like Project Cars 2 has such abysmal support for a popular wheel like the Logitech G29.

-The game stutters, skips, and rubberbands, even on equipment exceeding the recommended specs with the newest drivers. You can be playing this and easily hold 100+ FPS at stable temperatures on the highest settings, but suddenly you will hitch and stutter. You think to yourself ""Maybe I should lower my settings even though this makes no sense."" and it does the same thing at 60FPS. Riddle me this, if I am playing at maximum settings and not pushing my equipment to maximum load.. Why am I having random performance jerks and stutters? Look on the internet, you will find dozens of people with hitches and fast-forward glitches, and you will find fixes that are nothing more than placebo. 

-No custom championships, really? REALLY? Assetto Corsa has Custom Championships and quite predates this game. I'd forgive this if not for...

-Static, unchanging career mode. In a game that prides itself on being the ultimate driver journey, and further prides itself on its weather system, which can pull real-time weather info from the real world... All of the weather in career mode is static, pre-programmed and scripted. Every race will always have the same weather, no matter what you do, this COMPLETELY removes replayability from the career, you are doing the exact same fixed races over and over again under the same conditions.

Quickly and very subjectively summarising some main WF vs. FH4 points which made me enjoy playing WF:
- WF visuals are on par with FH4 (in some aspects even better and more detailed)
- WF car dynamics and reaction to driving on different surfaces feels kinda more real and less arcade-ish 
- WF  cars soft body destruction... well, nothing to compare here - it is 99% absent in FH4 for an understood reason : )
- WF cars sound more decent
- WF car bottoms are nicely detailed. FH4 has them as a single flat textured polygon.
- Controller mapping could be set almost 1 to 1 to a standard FH4 layout (manual + clutch) - Was very pleased that I had no discomfort form the first minute.

77,Wreckfest,Racing,228380,"This game is amazing!

I bought it on a bit of a whim, because it was on sale and I didn't have any drift or rally games. I have a decent sim-rig used mainly for Assetto Corsa and RFactor, which I also use for American Truck Simulator. Those are all quite sensible 'simulations', and I wanted something a bit more fun.

Well, Wreckfest is certainly fun! I imagine it's quite good using a gamepad using the top-down view, but with a force-feedback wheel, shifter, handbrake and pedals it's awesome.

The title doesn't really do it any favours, because there is more to this game than just huge crashes and wrecked cars. Yes, there are lots of demolition derby races, and even a last-car-standing mudpit. Watching the massive crashes on the replay is great fun. However, there are also lots of dirt track and circuit races too. The vehicle physics isn't going to worry Assetto Corsa any time, but it's still pretty realistic if you turn off all the driving aids. With a bit of handbrake you can set up some really impressive drifts, although the AI quickly proves that drifting is not the quickest way round the corners.

There's a bit of vehicle upgrading you can do, and to win some of the races you will need to upgrade the car. You can repaint your cars with a load of preset schemes, in an infinite range of colours.

Setting up all the different input devices was a doddle, although it defaults to automatic gears, and finding the setting to switch to manual took longer than it should have! Once I'd done that, it took a couple of minutes to map my handbrake and Fanatec shifter. I also had to remap the wheel and pedals because it had assigned the wrong axes. Easy to do. Unlike RFactor, which seems to forget all my devices every time I play it. Grrrr.

The default Force Feedback setting of 80% was far too high for my wheel. It was fighting me and causing tank-slappers. I turned it down to about 60% and it's way better.

Sadly, the game doesn't support head-tracking, and the FOV setting is rudimentary if you are using a single-screen sim-rig. That's a shame, because driving in-car instead of top-down is really immersive, but in a game like this you need to know where the other cars are. Your car doesn't have mirrors either. There is a HUD, but I have to confess I don't use it much because the game is REALLY intensive! I guess I'll just have to buy a couple more monitors...

The music gets a bit repetitive, which is a shame because it's suitably high-energy hard-rock. It feels like it needs more tracks.

Overall, a great fun game. Get it on sale, because there is quite a lot of DLC and you will want it all!",228380

I’m not saying it is the best, I just see Forza as some sophisticated simulation working for too many years and some people believe that's an unfair or unbeatable advantage. I don’t think that, given the proper work to convince me.

Here’s inside the British and both GT3 and GT4 cars including the tracks of its respective events, and of course its drivers. More about that down the review because of the DLCs, this isn’t exactly a slideshow of “civilian” cars; I love them but the thing here is about the corpo cars, filled with corpo decals, rather than fantasy racing running all naked. Given that, naturally the game abides to Blanpainc rules and regulations. You can race casually, but this isn’t one of those games.

Steering and artificial intelligence is slowly nearing there, even if with unstable curving trying to maintain it, still I have never experienced this before and you can impress other game’s drivers. Everytime I run Assetto Corsa Competizione I can almost smell the gas, if it wasn’t for a few things that still aren’t quite there but hopefully will one day. If you’re interested in this only for screenshots or to admire the scenery, random npcs or how good the grass looks, you got another thing coming. The graphics didn’t impress me and screen shot “cinema hud” options are weird to work with.

Those are tertiary elements in the scale of importance. What the driver is really interested in after buying; emulation, simulation, steering - I emphasize that part, and competition with all that in motion. But if they want us to truly smell the carbon dioxide, they gotta work more on the outtern details too, more immersive particle effects. That screenshot has filters and reshade mods that the game should have in first place, that impacted my final scoring in this review.

My first phase testing with the Lamborghini Youngster Programme was humiliating, as if I have never been behind any steering wheels. Yes I had to borrow from a nearby friend just to feel like a pro, but once I returned it, I had to readapt myself with a Xbone joystick - but don’t think this limited me, I managed to program it for the level of realism I like even with a joystick.

After taking care of my control situation, I decided to tweak my black demon. They give you a Huracàn Super Trofeo that growls like a devil hissing for meat, demanding sacrifices in the temple of speed. The devs decision to start the career at Monza was just too right.

So instead of 60 liters - the default fuel quantity they give you, I deducted only the enough amount for 5 laps instead around 21 liters, super basic but we tend to forget about these - because the game isn’t interested in doing everything for me which is great. Easing pressure, caring about the brakes and other dynamics and vóila, I could finally reach third to last position (better than last position) and with better knowledge I started climbing the ladder. I’m more interested in learning through experience and readings, but you can always look for setups around the the internet and then place it on your files and load it up.

The dynamics are so beautiful and harmonical, so realistic, I could finally see why some pilots in history performed better during rainy weather, to experience that for the first time in my gaming life - ever. Guys like Ayrton Senna in the F1 category for example and so many others.

The fight is different during the rain in the real world, your worries are condensed and the car and the tires are sliced. Little to none beneficial things like cooler brakes and bad omens like thin layers of water under the tires. A driver in the rainy weather would prefer to use the best line to avoid that part of the track that still is wet, not just water puddles because it is more complex than that - the fight during rainy weather is different and this is simulated on where it should. ACC proved me I’m a rainy racer, having greater time results whenever Jupiter is angry.

That doesn’t mean the casual should avoid it, but I’m afraid they would rather play something else, Competizione still can be tough even on easier modes. The setup isn’t like Dirt Rally 2.0 for example, with bars to slide around even on advanced setups (you’d see bars but it’s different) you either know what you’re doing or you do not. It is intuitive enough to keep you interested in it, experimenting, but you will need to know it anyway because there are not enough hints if you’re out of place. There are only a couple of basic pre-settings, but very often they’re not enough, just a rough bet for the things you’re going to face.

The hud seems overwhelming at first but you can remove things. I don’t recommend that because the devs thought about everything, even swapping colors in the speed meter when you need to shift but got no time to look at it, meant to alert your peripheral vision.

I don’t own any VR and no hero in my vicinity does, can’t rent around here either so you won’t have my views on that, as ironic as it sounds. There is a camera angle you can choose like a first person view from inside the helmet, but I don’t see much bobblehead physics, maybe it wouldn’t work? There is no gravity simulation shaking that camera angle nor when I brake too hard and I think simulation should start thinking about that.

[olist][*]The crowd people are what we call “cardboard audience” here where I live, very outdated. When the crowd is 3D (npcs from the pitstops for example) they’re badly animated. We’re not in 2006 anymore, so please.

[*]Rain sprites droplets are nasty, like most frames based graphics in this game are and it needs updating. It isn’t better, not even in “epic” settings. More particles are needed too.

[*]Not so rarely, impact sound effects are just repetitive even when you’re performing something else not related to that. You’d hear some clanks and bumps when not clanking nor bumping, although minimal it is undermining the attention to details it already has.

[*]Artificial intelligence does suffer from the conditions of the track, but it could be better. Most super simulated games only think about you and your sweaty fights. AI needs to be prone to mistakes more often, maybe some sort of fear-factor and stress like humans do. I don’t know how the hell they would do it, but it is awful to see that they don't do much.

[*]The game demands more identity, and the career mode is the way to do that. You’re welcomed by pilot Mirko Bortolotti himself trying to warn/prepare you for what is about to come, then not much is shown, game needs more style. Not just cosmetics but further expansion of career mode. I just think details aren’t enough to rival other games right now.[/olist]

Horizon Chase Turbo is a very simple racing game. There's no worries with ideal racing line or tyre wear, you just plant your foot on the gas and go ahead, dodging the incoming cars. While you do it, you can also grab medals on the track, that at the end of the race, add up to your score. With enough score you unlock the next races and more cars for you to choose from.

It's a cool little game but not without its flaws. One of which is there's a upgrade system in the game, which is welcome sure, but it's implement in the weirdest way possible. As you get your score higher, you unlock races to run for those upgrades, once you win the race you'll have a small selection to choose from, but after you choose one upgrade that is added to all your cars. So sure, more grip to go faster on the turns is always nice, but i would like for my gripy cars to have some top speed instead.

Also, if you remember the original TopGear on the SNES, you might remember that game had pitstops, because each car would use fuel at a different rate, so the slowest car could very well win by simply not stopping or making a splash&go. No such a thing in this game tho, which is not a deal breaker, but something that it's odd to not have when the game lift so much of its gameplay from the TopGear games.

Music is also something very much close to the soundtrack of TopGear, specially the first game, with some songs almost identical but slightly changed for copyright reasons, i'm sure.

Overall, it's a great little game that doesn't take it self seriously and it's just fine for when you don't want to take it seriously too.",389140

Just dont crash in your first race and FINISH, even if it's 10th, you will still get a safety rating increase and on your way out of rookies! (where the fun really begins)

83,Stardew Valley,Simulation,413150,"This game is dangerous. 

When I first started playing I was like, ""It's cool, farming is fun but I don't really see the hype around it."" 

Then I kept playing.

It's gotten so bad that I have 10 tabs open just to look up stuff on the wiki for this game. I open the game and blink and two hours have passed, and while I feel sad that I just lost so much time, I look at the progress I made on my farm and think, ""Worth."" 

This is one of the most fun games I've ever played.

It's designed in such a way that it allows both casual players and competitive / optimization-oriented players to have a blast with this game. There is so much to do in this game, and there's so much to offer. You can spend your days farming, fishing, mining, foraging, talking to the villagers, etc. The game is made in a way in which you don't have to hyper-optimize every little detail like min-maxing profit, time management, etc, because there's no time limit for things (unless you count seasons, but there's always another year) and there's no stakes. But if you want to, you definitely can. 

Talking to the villagers is fun as well, they're well-designed, and you can even find patterns in their daily schedules. There's a lot of details in this game.

I haven't tried the multiplayer, but from what I've seen it can definitely be a lot more fun with friends. But playing solo is extremely fun as well.

My only gripe with the game is that it's a huge time sink. I waited until my semester was over to get into it because I heard about the time sink beforehand, and I was glad I waited, because all I can think about now is, ""What crops am I going to plant next season? Where I should place them? How much money am I making from these? Should I fish or mine? Did I feed my animals today? DID I TALK TO ROBIN TODAY?"" 

And of course, Robin is best girl, no discussion there.",413150

We have all heard of ""Fallout New Vegas"" and I, as many others have been taught or shown across the internet is that this is the definitive best fallout game. So after some time I decided to get the game with all it's DLC's and decided that I would check out the game and see if all the hype was concrete or was just fallout fans with rose tinted glasses.

I start of with installing and starting the game and realizing that it is completely uncompatable with windows 10. This may be on Bethesda's part as I know fallout 3 has this exact issue as well. So my journey begins in the mod manager and .ini files to enable more memory usage. But after these fixes the game only crashed twice throughout my whole 100 hour playthrough. 
(The mods included in my mod list have no effect on the game but only made it crash less and fix memory usage)

So I start of with an amazing introduction to the main factions and the story taking place in Fallout New Vegas from the get go by a aged but still good cinematic. Comparing it to the Fallout 4 cinematic I would say this one introduces alot more of the world to the player compared to the black and white war scene all about ""war never changes"". I start of the game with making my character. In comparison to other RPG's like Skyrim (or Fallout 4) this game truly gave you the tools to make your own character. Everything from the wacky dialogue options to actual things that could impact your gameplay is decided from what S.P.E.C.I.A.L points, skills and perks you picked. This really made it feel like your decisions mattered from the get go. So I get on my mary way out on to the Majave wasteland and instantly get hit with this massive world to explore but I follow a long the main story and talk to ""Easy Pete"" and get introduced to these amazing dialogue options. Comparing it to other Bethesda games they were truly fleshed out and you could totally make sense of the conversation when you could actually read a sentance that your character would say instead of a few words or ""yes"" and ""no"".

At this point I also get introduced to the Karma system where bad and good actions could impact your late game stats. As I get hit with these intrequet systems that I would say are pretty overwhelming if you don't expect it or are not used to RPG's or other roleplaying games I also discover the grave sight and see a grave. You can dig a grave but only if you have a shovel, so I go to the little ponsy shop in Goodsprings right next to the grave sight and buy a shovel. With this I had made an impact on my  gameplay through my choices and ended up with a laser rifle. A mid game weapon at level 2. When this happened I knew I was gonna have a good time with this game. I made my way and thought I would make my way to the big glowing tower that is the ""Lucky 38"" and boy did I get turned into shreds by those deathclaws. Facing the strongest enemy in the game and it not feeling like a cake walk like in a later released fallout game. It showed me where my place was which was killing powder gangers and thugs after I got my ass beat by every abomination I came across. It set a milestone for me to get through that valley and kill those radscorpions that plagued me when I left goodsprings. The game made me feel like I was in for a journey, a journey that was mine to make and my choices mattered. Here the characters, the voice acting, the effects. They were lasting and they did change the story for my character which made the game so much more enjoyable. 

After my introductions to the game as a whole I got to know the factions in the game a little more and if I were to summarize them I would describe them as such. The Legion are the ""bad guys"" who are misogynistic, dog fucking, twink boy-toy slave owners that base themselves on the ideals of the roman enthusiast Ceasar. Then we have the NCR (New Californian Republic) the ""good guys"" who traveled into New Vegas to help the citizens and by ""help"" they mean help the areas with recources they need.

SUMMARY: 

GAMEPLAY:
The game held up to the expectations I was expecting which was shocking as I went into the game thinking ""this game is the best RPG I have ever played"". But it truly is the best RPG I have ever played and the best RPG on my game list. I love all the elements of this game and how your actions can impact the games surroundings and that your choices matter for the story and in general gameplay.

COMBAT:
The gun play is simple yes, yet satisfying and a lot of perks you learn compliment the experience. Melee is simple and don't involve more complex combat except block and swing but it is satisfying turning a ghoul's head into mash potatoe. 

STORY:
The main story has a simple premise but has complex solutions as you can shape the ending of the game however you deem fit which is something truly rare in games these days. Even story telling games don't dwell into your choices mattering this much for the outcome of the story.

SOUND/MUSIC:
If you don't turn on the radio in this game you are truly missing out on some bangers I am telling ya, but seriously the sound design in this game is as everything else truly masterful. You will have to explore the vaults and everything else with it's matching soundtrack that either puts shivers down your spine, makes you enticipate what combat scenario is next or makes you jam in out in the lobby halls of the casinos.

GRAPHICS:
Now this game is 10 years old so I didn't wanna slack on it too hard but even some games that came out the following year looked a lot better than this. But the graphics are not too bad, they are still good especially by 2010 standards and give more of a Fallout feeling to it all. Something about the graphical design of New Vegas just give more of a rustic run down wasteland sort of feeling with its orange tones but that might just be me.

DLC'S:
I really enjoyed 3/4 DLC's which were. Old World Blues, Honest Hearts, Lonesome Road. If you are playing New Vegas these DLC's are a must play in my opinion as they are truly great DLC's. Dead Money on the other hand did not hit home for me as many others. But if you like dialogues with character building and clues of a mystery to solve and puzzles I can see how you would enjoy this DLC as well.

ARCHITECHTURE:
The buildings just look great, you know what they are supposed to be and in what conditions. You know what buildings stand out and which ones you can enter apart from some instances.

THE BAD:
Now there are alot of great things with this game that is for sure, like how great the RPG elements are and so on. But there is a few bad things, like how the game isn't functional from the get go and that you have to manually fix it. There is also the landscape which has some unique parts like red rock canyon and the area around the strip that look notorious and when you are there you know exactly where you are. But a part from those specific places all the other 60~% look the same but that is the only concern I had when playing apart from some bugs and the two instances of crashes.

Here out in the Mojave, you are a Courier and are free to follow your own path, do your own thing. For example, in no particular order:

- Shoot gangs.
- Shoot gangs for other gangs.
- Tell people that you'd like to see their wares.
- Gamble with people's lives in the name of peace or law and order.
- Gamble literally.
- Gamble with your reputation as you balance mercy and vengeance on the fly.
- Lose all of your caps at the place that's not Sodom.
- Quench your thirst with more than just purified water.
- Escape a crumbling treasure vault to the ramblings of an old man.
- Aid the remnants of a fascist, paramilitary organization.
- Aid a whole charity, humanitarian organization.
- Help a face on a TV screen achieve regional domination.
- Hit said face with a 9 iron in the name of a bear or a bull.
- Destroy a robot dog created by some robot scientist with your... I can't say, sorry. They're on your hands and feet, that's all I am allowed to tell you.
- Self-destruct a bunker because you wanted to put them all on crosses but couldn't so you went with the next best option.
- Stray away from the road towards a crashed retro-futuristic helicopter and almost wish for a nuclear winter.
- Learn to use endgame armor only to realize you're still not invincible to living science experiments; the hard way.
- Let a monorail get destroyed because of your loose lips.
- Take advantage of someone else's loose lips in order to take over Vegas.
- Jury-rig a few heaps of electric parts to a heap of metal to create the hands-down best companion you will ever meet.
- Cement ""the Butcher"" to Ulysses S. Grant's reputation for eternity, albeit with a different surname.
- Watch a team of pseudo-adventurers get massacred by a giant scorpion in a firehouse.
- Watch a group of ghouls re-enact Jonestown... by accident. I think.
- Get paid for having someone else's hat.
- Get paid for collecting special caps.
- Demand better payment for collecting said caps.
- Get paid for doing your job.
- Forget you had a job by taking another.
- Destroy everything with nothin' but a hound dog. This one won't make you feel so blue.
- Destroy entire families and factions.
- Turn on the radio because the vault was getting too scary.
- Turn it back off for the immersion.
- Persuade away your problems, shoot them, punch through them, let them sizzle out, fake them out. Or forget about them.

I think you get the idea. Beyond the crashing, pitiful combat, and quest bugs that are funny yet annoying, is still quite a gem of PC gaming. The ways you can play this game, and still have fun, are nearly endless. And each of those times, you'll find a couple of details you glossed over in the previous playthrough. Now that's a sign of a great piece of media right there. Helps me to... turn a blind eye to its crashaholic tendencies.

I will compare this game to other RPG's or similar games. If you want a summary of this review I will write it at the bottom of this review along with the reviews of the DLC's but on to the start.

84,Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,the quests and story are very good. There are multiple ways to go about resolving pretty much any situation. The game does benefit greatly from quality of life mods but you will still have a great time with the vanilla game!,22380
84,Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,ok,22380
84,Fallout: New Vegas,RPG,22380,"If you can't bear hours of backstory dialogue or get madder than a bull seeing red when the game mysteriously disappears, I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise, welcome, you've made it to a goldmine of RPGs.

Here out in the Mojave, you are a Courier and are free to follow your own path, do your own thing. For example, in no particular order:

- Shoot gangs.
- Shoot gangs for other gangs.
- Tell people that you'd like to see their wares.
- Gamble with people's lives in the name of peace or law and order.
- Gamble literally.
- Gamble with your reputation as you balance mercy and vengeance on the fly.
- Lose all of your caps at the place that's not Sodom.
- Quench your thirst with more than just purified water.
- Escape a crumbling treasure vault to the ramblings of an old man.
- Aid the remnants of a fascist, paramilitary organization.
- Aid a whole charity, humanitarian organization.
- Help a face on a TV screen achieve regional domination.
- Hit said face with a 9 iron in the name of a bear or a bull.
- Destroy a robot dog created by some robot scientist with your... I can't say, sorry. They're on your hands and feet, that's all I am allowed to tell you.
- Self-destruct a bunker because you wanted to put them all on crosses but couldn't so you went with the next best option.
- Stray away from the road towards a crashed retro-futuristic helicopter and almost wish for a nuclear winter.
- Learn to use endgame armor only to realize you're still not invincible to living science experiments; the hard way.
- Let a monorail get destroyed because of your loose lips.
- Take advantage of someone else's loose lips in order to take over Vegas.
- Jury-rig a few heaps of electric parts to a heap of metal to create the hands-down best companion you will ever meet.
- Cement ""the Butcher"" to Ulysses S. Grant's reputation for eternity, albeit with a different surname.
- Watch a team of pseudo-adventurers get massacred by a giant scorpion in a firehouse.
- Watch a group of ghouls re-enact Jonestown... by accident. I think.
- Get paid for having someone else's hat.
- Get paid for collecting special caps.
- Demand better payment for collecting said caps.
- Get paid for doing your job.
- Forget you had a job by taking another.
- Destroy everything with nothin' but a hound dog. This one won't make you feel so blue.
- Destroy entire families and factions.
- Turn on the radio because the vault was getting too scary.
- Turn it back off for the immersion.
- Persuade away your problems, shoot them, punch through them, let them sizzle out, fake them out. Or forget about them.

I think you get the idea. Beyond the crashing, pitiful combat, and quest bugs that are funny yet annoying, is still quite a gem of PC gaming. The ways you can play this game, and still have fun, are nearly endless. And each of those times, you'll find a couple of details you glossed over in the previous playthrough. Now that's a sign of a great piece of media right there. Helps me to... turn a blind eye to its crashaholic tendencies.

I am 60.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realise that.

86,DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,hardest thing so far was holding back the tears after realizing you bought the game one day before a 75% sale,374320
86,DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,Love this game but right now on PC it needs to be patched there is too much hacking going on. just lost my progress due to hackers,374320
86,DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,Cute game,374320
86,DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"One of the greatest games ever made, following the footsteps of the first dark souls with improved animations, netcoding and general mechanics. This game feels very smooth and fights are absolutely amazing. Dark souls 3 adds more challenge to the game by making the mobs more aggressive, a lot like in BloodBorn. I absolutely want to recommend this game as a big fan of dark souls series and for the gameplay quality but due to it's state I can not do so, I feel like I have the responsibility to inform you about the situation that's going on in the game. 

Cheaters have taken over the game in large numbers, Dark souls has it's own brutal anti-cheat system but it is very ineffective when cheaters can create alt steam accounts to bypass bans and strike again. The cheating scene has been going on for years and years now but it has evolved to the point where cheaters can actually cause permanent damage to your PC or even pish information you'd not want to share online. These cheats are evolving constantly due to the big playerbase and lack of action from Bandai Namco. So who knows maybe in future Dark souls 3 on steam could work as a backdoor access to your PC in a way. Very high security risk here. I talked to Bandai Namco's support about the issue and they are aware of what is going on and I was told that they are working on the issue, but in truth nothing has been done in 3 years or so when all this started to boom.

If you play this game in OFFLINE mode you will not have any problems, also there are mods such as Blue-Sentinel which is telling you when you are being invaded by a cheater and it tries to block you connecting to them in future, use of this mod is bannable reason but Bandai Namco's anti-cheat can't track it as the mod does not affect the game itself that much. I recommend using this mod if you plan to play the game.",374320

In the last month, several issues with player's game being completely hacked into with malicious code that not only lets them into your game, but also your hard drive, SSD and potentially more. Check out the reddit for this game and its pinned post or some of the negative reviews below for more info. Great game, but probably one of the worst instances of hacking in terms of severity I've ever seen from a mainstream game that's being completely ignored.",374320

I had been loving the game and I had just spent the last 37 hours playing.

This security issue needs to be addressed before this game can be recommended again, this is a huge issue that could even cause GPU hacks and totally corrupt your PC.

VALVE ADDRESS THIS NOW, THIS GAME SHOULD BE PULLED FROM YOUR STORE UNTIL THIS IS ADDRESSED!!!

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!",374320
86,DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Good game, but is PLAGUED with hackers that teleport, force instant death animations, prevent you from using separation crystal (forcing you to force close the game) and in other cases completely wiping ALL of your progress That's right, a hacker can invade you and simply erase countless hours of progress from your character. They can also force actions on your character that makes the game detect you as a cheater, penalizing you and BANNING you from online forever even though you didn't do anything. While this hasn't happened to me there are plenty of cases of it happening. I cannot recommend the game until this is handled properly by FromSoftware. A system where fair players get banned and hackers continue terrorizing the community is unacceptable.",374320
86,DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Whilst I really like this game, I cannot recommend anyone buying it. There is a serious exploit making the rounds online that lets hackers mess up your save game really bad and Bamco and FromSoftware have been made aware of it a long time ago and they have chosen not to patch it. So unless you use 3rd party software to protect yourself from hackers, you are putting your save game to serious risk every time you engage in online play. Not to mention the plethora of older exploits and hacks that have not been patched. Fix your game From, this is not acceptable.",374320

I am a big Souls-Like fan thanks to Dark Souls III, the first game of the genre, and the series, that I have played. 
I have been planning on writing a review about this game for a long time now, but never found the perfect timing to do so. Now, that the game is having a discount, and probably there will be plenty of people coming to give it a look, I decided to write this review. 
Like I did with my Dark Souls: Remastered review on Steam, I will separate this review into 2 main parts: the Technical Aspect and the Story/Plot/Lore of the game. 

 [h1] Technical Aspect: [/h1]

Firstly, I would like to say that this game has not the same mechanics as Dark Souls I and Dark Souls II, they end up being faster-paced, and also a lot of hitboxes issues have been improved. With that said, due to the date of launch of the game, it’s is obviously getting better graphics and textures, 2 aspects that the previous games weren’t strong at. 
Being FromSoftware the company that we are talking about, the scenario, the ambiance and the designs are, of course, on the point and perfectly fit in each occasion of the game, giving the player the same immersion given on the other Soulsborne games. Being even more detailed on that aspect, places like High Wall of Lothric, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, The Ringed City, Archdragon Peak, and Kiln of the First Flame, will mostly pass to the player a feeling of astonishment due to the amazing landscapes and atmosphere that they have. While, on the other hand, there will be areas that will give the player the feeling of progression and curiosity about what is to come, like, Road of Sacrifices, Cathedral of the Deep, Farron Keep, Catacombs of Carthus, and actually most of the other places to visit. 
Just like Dark Souls I, areas in Dark Souls III like Archdragon Peak and Untended Graves will be hidden and will only be discovered with certain triggers. 
The music can be really amazing at some bosses, but at others, it can feel kind of boring, which is a negative trait when compared to Dark Souls I’s unique compositions by Motoi Sakuraba (that being only my opinion though). 
The combat mechanic varied a lot from the previous games to Dark Souls III. Now there are specific habilities and possible combinations with each weapon presented. It synthesized ideas presented before in the other previous games and ended up making a pleasurable result (and, as said before, faster-paced). 
Lastly, to conclude this topic, Dark Souls III is a game that will not feel somewhat tiring when compared to the other Dark Souls, it balances every aspect already mentioned and does an amazing job to entertain the player for the first run until how many times one will feel like to play it again and again and again (in my case, 4 runs have already been completed). 

 [h1] Story/Plot/Lore: [/h1]

It would be impossible to put together every piece of lore in a review, thus I will be summarizing the main plot.
Unkindled, the player is a composition of the ash from the once, fire-devoted, undead that has given itself to the flame, and its duty remains the same. 
The game starts off presenting that the “fire fades” and that the Lords go without thrones. Giving that we are in the same universe set by Dark Souls I and II, we are left with speculations until finally arrive at conclusions by progressing in the game. 
The whereabouts are the “same” as Dark Souls I… However, there are slightly different things that might give the idea of the passage of time. Hundreds, or perhaps, thousands of years have passed since the Age of Fire and mighty new Lords of Cinder have linked the fire to maintain it. Even though there are controversies on the “time” aspect in Dark Souls III. [spoiler] The time seems to be simultaneously blended with the Abyss and dark of long ago (in which the concept of time doesn't exists) and also the present that is experiencing the undying cycle of the fire legacy, which would probably be a base for proving the theory of the End of the World during the Filianore cutscene in The Ringed City (in which there is a burst of light, indicating time, and, consequently, a time-skip beyond the living of anything). [/spoiler]
As for the main objective, the player would have to kill the 4 lords of cinder that neglect themselves to link the flame once again because it would be useless and that they would die in which way. [spoiler] The only one that remains in the Firelink Shrine is Ludleth, whom has long ago linked the fire, and now is just waiting for his end on his throne... for that, he is known as The Exiled. [/spoiler] The objetive of killing those Lords would be to acquire the necessary power in order to link the fire.
Killing every Lord of Cinder and putting their ashes on their thrones will let the player travel to the Kiln of the First Flame, [spoiler] the place where the battle against Soul of Cinder happens, a manifestation of every Lord Soul until then. [/spoiler]
Not only in terms of new Lords of Cinder speculations and lore the game creates its identity, but there would also be the side-bosses encounters that reveal individuals or even groups that shaped the dying world of Dark Souls III (e.g. Pontiff Sulyvahn; Oceiros; etc). 
In terms of DLC (Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City), lore-wise speaking, it presents a rich story completion and also the Grand Finale for the series with the final boss fight against [spoiler] Slave Knight Gael, an undead, like you, seeking the blood of the Dark Soul for his lady's painting, who would be going to paint a new world for humanity. [/spoiler]

 [h1] Conclusion [/h1]

I cannot put in words my passion for the game, I can simply recommend buying it with or without a discount, it is worth each time played and each credit paid. I do not even possess a high knowledge about the game yet, but I am still discovering and reading about its deep and amazing world.

;

I've had many amazing and terrible experiences with this game, but overall, it's helped me cope with some of the most difficult years of my life. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, general anxiety disorder, and ADHD. I don't think I would have survived the depression and trauma I've experienced lately if it weren't for this game. I failed out of a couple colleges due to mental breakdowns and attempted suicide on several occasions throughout the past 5 years. This game served as an escape from my everyday struggle. It's why I have 400 hours in this game on PC, and around 300 on PS4. I stopped playing this game a year ago, when I was finally in a good mental state of being.

Then the pandemic came.

I've gradually lost the ground of mental stability due to isolation, separation from the person I love the most and my depression being exacerbated. Due to circumstances, I cannot see my partner in person nearly ever. The last time I saw them was in March, and February before that. Although that isn't the most difficult thing I've dealt with this year. In January of 2021, my father had a massive aneurysm that he miraculously survived. Since then, though, he has been severely disabled and bedridden at a hospital. My family and I have been doing our best to keep him strong and on the road to recovery, but it's far from easy. At this point, he will be disabled for the rest of his life. The past couple months have been extremely trying, culminating with me calling the suicide hotline for the first time in years. I never thought I'd get this low again, but life happens, y'know?

Since I called that hotline, I've gotten a bit better. A lot of it has to do with my friends, family, and partner supporting me, as well as the therapy I'm undergoing. I've noticed though that I've really improved once I re-downloaded this game and started playing it again. There's just... something about the immense challenge these soulsborne games present that is so special. Overcoming these challenges are so cathartic and inspiring, and helps me feel capable tackling my real life problems. This game has tortured me at times whenever I struggled to find victory. But I always came back to this game after every defeat, unable to let myself give up. It taught me that can't let myself give up on life, no matter how many times I'm defeated.

I had set a challenge for myself a couple years back: to defeat the Nameless King solo. I had never done this before, and felt I needed to prove to myself I could do it. I am far from a great Souls player, so this was a big deal for me. I spent a year trying to beat Nameless King by myself (I was on NG+7 too, as my best character was on that save). I spec'd and re-spec'd into various builds, until I got my character to be a lightning caster/dark melee build. It was past a year at this point for my attempts. One day, I was going at NK as usual. I managed to get him to half health in his second phase, but I had exhausted all my estus. I kept hacking at him though, little by little getting him lower. He hit me a few times, getting me to being one-hit away from death. At this point, I was close to beating him. Just a few more hits... when he got to being one-hit, I threw out an attack as he began his own attack-- a gamble. And then... 

I did it. I won. I beat him. I watched the cutscene in total shock. Not a word... I was speechless. I lit the bonfire and then broke down into tears of joy and relief. It is still the biggest accomplishment in gaming for me. Overall, I haven't experienced many accomplishments in my life. The feeling of a hard-fought victory, even in a video game, had inspired me to not give up, and still inspires me to keep on going to this day. This game is one of the many reasons why I'm alive today.

I feel like my story isn't particularly uncommon. Many people have comfort games or shows or movies or books, and it's fine still if you don't have one of those. Dark Souls III might not be a comfort game for everyone, but I know the Souls games as a whole have been THAT game for a lot of people still. It could be THAT game for you.

If you've read this far into my story, thank you, I appreciate you so much. If you or someone close to you struggles with suicide, know that it's okay to feel that way. Life is hard and unforgiving at times. Painful, violent, and hopeless. And it will always be like that. But life can be also be immensely fulfilling. Full of love, joy, compassion, laughter, and peace. Hard times are often hard lessons so that we can grow stronger for ourselves and the people around us. The good times come to make life worth living, and the bad times come to make us worthy of life. If you're struggling, please, reach out to someone who cares about you, and if you can't find a person like that, the suicide hotline will be there for you (800-273-8255 if you're in the States). Suicide is a choice you make, but it isn't the only choice you can make. There's always a way out. You can conquer your demons. You are stronger than you know. Against seemingly immense odds, you can win. It's human to struggle. But it's also human to overcome. You got this. So all I have left to say is this:

""Good bye then. Be safe, friend. Don't you dare go Hollow.""",374320

86,DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"One of the greatest games ever made, following the footsteps of the first dark souls with improved animations, netcoding and general mechanics. This game feels very smooth and fights are absolutely amazing. Dark souls 3 adds more challenge to the game by making the mobs more aggressive, a lot like in BloodBorn. I absolutely want to recommend this game as a big fan of dark souls series and for the gameplay quality but due to it's state I can not do so, I feel like I have the responsibility to inform you about the situation that's going on in the game. 

Cheaters have taken over the game in large numbers, Dark souls has it's own brutal anti-cheat system but it is very ineffective when cheaters can create alt steam accounts to bypass bans and strike again. The cheating scene has been going on for years and years now but it has evolved to the point where cheaters can actually cause permanent damage to your PC or even pish information you'd not want to share online. These cheats are evolving constantly due to the big playerbase and lack of action from Bandai Namco. So who knows maybe in future Dark souls 3 on steam could work as a backdoor access to your PC in a way. Very high security risk here. I talked to Bandai Namco's support about the issue and they are aware of what is going on and I was told that they are working on the issue, but in truth nothing has been done in 3 years or so when all this started to boom.

If you play this game in OFFLINE mode you will not have any problems, also there are mods such as Blue-Sentinel which is telling you when you are being invaded by a cheater and it tries to block you connecting to them in future, use of this mod is bannable reason but Bandai Namco's anti-cheat can't track it as the mod does not affect the game itself that much. I recommend using this mod if you plan to play the game.",374320

86,DARK SOULS™ III,RPG,374320,"Extremely good game, however, an ongoing issue yet to be fixed or remotely addressed is the issue with hacking. In the last month, several issues with player's game being completely hacked into with malicious code that not only lets them into your game, but also your hard drive, SSD and potentially more. Check out the reddit for this game and its pinned post or some of the negative reviews below for more info.

They can also force actions on your character that makes the game detect you as a cheater, penalizing you and BANNING you from online forever even though you didn't do anything.

I've had many amazing and terrible experiences with this game, but overall, it's helped me cope with some of the most difficult years of my life. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, general anxiety disorder, and ADHD. I don't think I would have survived the depression and trauma I've experienced lately if it weren't for this game.

Since then, though, he has been severely disabled and bedridden at a hospital. My family and I have been doing our best to keep him strong and on the road to recovery, but it's far from easy. At this point, he will be disabled for the rest of his life. The past couple months have been extremely trying, culminating with me calling the suicide hotline for the first time in years. I never thought I'd get this low again, but life happens, y'know?

Since I called that hotline, I've gotten a bit better. A lot of it has to do with my friends, family, and partner supporting me, as well as the therapy I'm undergoing. I've noticed though that I've really improved once I re-downloaded this game and started playing it again. There's just... something about the immense challenge these soulsborne games present that is so special. Overcoming these challenges are so cathartic and inspiring, and helps me feel capable tackling my real life problems. This game has tortured me at times whenever I struggled to find victory. But I always came back to this game after every defeat, unable to let myself give up. It taught me that can't let myself give up on life, no matter how many times I'm defeated.

I had set a challenge for myself a couple years back: to defeat the Nameless King solo. I had never done this before, and felt I needed to prove to myself I could do it. I am far from a great Souls player, so this was a big deal for me. I spent a year trying to beat Nameless King by myself (I was on NG+7 too, as my best character was on that save). I spec'd and re-spec'd into various builds, until I got my character to be a lightning caster/dark melee build. It was past a year at this point for my attempts. One day, I was going at NK as usual. I managed to get him to half health in his second phase, but I had exhausted all my estus. I kept hacking at him though, little by little getting him lower. He hit me a few times, getting me to being one-hit away from death. At this point, I was close to beating him. Just a few more hits... when he got to being one-hit, I threw out an attack as he began his own attack-- a gamble. And then... 

I did it. I won. I beat him. I watched the cutscene in total shock. Not a word... I was speechless. I lit the bonfire and then broke down into tears of joy and relief. It is still the biggest accomplishment in gaming for me. Overall, I haven't experienced many accomplishments in my life. The feeling of a hard-fought victory, even in a video game, had inspired me to not give up, and still inspires me to keep on going to this day. This game is one of the many reasons why I'm alive today.

I feel like my story isn't particularly uncommon. Many people have comfort games or shows or movies or books, and it's fine still if you don't have one of those. Dark Souls III might not be a comfort game for everyone, but I know the Souls games as a whole have been THAT game for a lot of people still. It could be THAT game for you.

If you've read this far into my story, thank you, I appreciate you so much. If you or someone close to you struggles with suicide, know that it's okay to feel that way. Life is hard and unforgiving at times. Painful, violent, and hopeless. And it will always be like that. But life can be also be immensely fulfilling. Full of love, joy, compassion, laughter, and peace. Hard times are often hard lessons so that we can grow stronger for ourselves and the people around us. The good times come to make life worth living, and the bad times come to make us worthy of life. If you're struggling, please, reach out to someone who cares about you, and if you can't find a person like that, the suicide hotline will be there for you (800-273-8255 if you're in the States). Suicide is a choice you make, but it isn't the only choice you can make. There's always a way out. You can conquer your demons. You are stronger than you know. Against seemingly immense odds, you can win. It's human to struggle. But it's also human to overcome. You got this. So all I have left to say is this:

Some things to note before buying this game 

1) It's armor system is unlike most other games. It blocks status effects and crowd control until it is removed then they can be applied (a couple of feats you can pick up can bypass this on enemies but that's the exception not the norm)

2) If you're playing through this game for the first time, don't feel bad if you can't play it at the highest difficulty. It's not meant for a first time playthrough but to challenge experienced players on subsequent ones with more enemies, more intelligent enemy AI and (of course) stronger enemies as well.

3) When building your party composition, it's better to do all 4 magical, all four physical, or two and two. I do not recommend you go with one person solely as one thing and the other three as another as that one person all by themselves will not be contributing much to fights.

4) There is no ""tank"" in this game. That sort of role doesn't exist. There are also no traditional classes, optimizing for certain builds is of course a thing (and for harder difficulties almost mandatory) but the sky is the limit with your imagination so long as you play within the confines of the system

87,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"I started this game during COVID in August 2020, when a couple friends suggested that it’s like a tabletop RPG (“TTRPG”) and might be fun to play together weekly. I couldn’t get into it at first, mostly due to distraction, but once we got a good third of the way through the first act, I was intrigued. I then became more hooked each session and by the fifth or so, I was loving the game and actively looking forward to our game nights. Once we were halfway, I started a solo save to catch up to where we were, more thoroughly following the story on my own. It took us about 6 months to finish the game, but we never missed a week of playing in all that time and I completed my solo game soon after. While it was partially the social aspect of hanging out with friends online, it’s not an exaggeration to say that this game helped me stay sane during one of the craziest times of my life thus far and it will always hold a special place for me because of it. But that was also in large part because this game is simply awesome. It’s probably the only game that I ended up loving despite not enjoying the first solid 8 hours or so of gameplay.

OS2 is essentially a TTRPG adapted to a fully realized digital world. While it has mechanics you might expect for a game going for that feel such as dialogue options, it does several other unique things to achieve that feel. For instance, one of the appeals of a TTRPG is that you can do whatever you want within the logic of the game, not just narratively, but with how you maneuver in combat. Considering the limitations of a finite game, OS2 allows for a multitude of combat options that never feels limited, even though obviously it is to some extent. The environment is highly interactable and can be used to your advantage with dynamic and creative environmental conditions. Skills like teleport and various battlefield-warping abilities also do much more clever things beyond just dealing damage. There’s also the system of physical and magic armor that prevents conditions, adding a layer of complexity that encourages strategic play, even though it’s deceptively simple on the surface. I still felt like I had the variety of options available in a TTRPG, even if it was limited to a finite combination of options. It says a lot when being stuck on a given fight could be solved by a better approach rather than simply trying to level up.

Other TTRPG elements deal with the world-building, story, and tone. There’s a rich world with lots of peoples with their own rich histories and varied proclivities, interacting with internal and external factions and nations with their own agendas. I like that the different peoples and factions aren’t the usual monoliths common to fantasy and demonstrate internal diversity. There’s plenty of lore to be explored in Rivellon that makes the stories and locations you encounter come to life.

The tone achieved by the narrative is also on point. One commonality to a lot of TTRPGs is a serious story that inevitably has some silliness as the players get up to some mischief or another. This leads to dramatic and intriguing storylines that are willing to step back for a moment of humor that (ideally) doesn’t break you out of the story. This is exactly how I’d describe OS2. The story is fairly serious and involves some dark themes at times, but at numerous points, especially side quests, there are amusing NPCs and conversations galore that never quite break the narrative but add a good deal of clever humor and even some laugh-out-loud moments without straying into the just plain goofy territory that pulls you from the narrative.

This isn’t the prettiest game I’ve played for its time, but still looks great and I think it’s balanced very well with the playstyle, offering vivid, immersive, appealing scenery that isn’t too confusing to navigate. The audio design is amazing. Sound effects are fine, but the soundtrack is superb. I generally dislike the sort of generic DnD folksy tavern style music that this soundtrack mostly fits into. But for whatever reason, these songs just click with me and never blend together like much of that kind of music usually does to me. If I hear a song from this game, I’ll recognize it immediately. Some tracks are better than others, but overall, they all work quite well. The vast majority of the massive script is also competently voiced, which is incredible.

I found the story pretty strong. There is a main quest full of twists and turns, personal to your character that you must progress to move on with the game. There are a number of side quests as well, a staple of RPGs that can be really hit or miss. While not quite as good as some of the best side quests like Witcher 3, I think the side quests are generally very good. OS2 dodges dull fetch quests and “please kill the rats in my cellar” quests. Even the simplest quests often are made more interesting in some way, such as an early quest in which you have to fight a trio of saltwater crocodiles who have swallowed a pair of teleportation gloves that will be super useful once you get them. The quests are almost always engaging in some way given the strong writing of NPCs and the worldbuilding features that makes these quests entertaining in their own right even aside from the consequent exploration and challenge. None of the quests did I feel like was just some random bullshit I was doing solely to get experience.

There are 6 pre-made characters to choose from. I’ll call these “canon PCs.” Each canon PC has a continuing personal quest such as Lohse’s quest to rid herself of demonic possession or Sebille’s quest for revenge. These quests are a great way to flesh out the main characters, even if they’re not super long and only come up intermittently. Through several playthroughs, I played through the story quests of every canon PC. While my favorites are Lohse, Fane, and Sebille, none of the personal stories fell flat and I can’t imagine playing through the game with one of them in your party without doing their personal quests. Beware, if you make a custom character, you don’t get a personal story.

The gameplay is great. This is almost definitely my favorite combat system for a pure turn-based RPG. The combat is in a lot of ways closer to “turn-based strategy” than purely “RPG,” but this fits the TTRPG style with line of sight, distance, range, positioning, area of effect, enemy weaknesses, and build diversity all being important to your success in a given battle. There’s a wealth of options for each of your four party members to invest in and combine. Even after three playthroughs, there are still styles and skill combinations I’m interested in trying out some time.

This game can be played in a group or solo. In a solo game, you get one main character and fill your party with up to three of the other canon PCs. As a group, each of you has plays their own main character, filling any other slots with side characters. It was really fun experiencing, commentating, and poking fun at the story’s events as a group of three. I enjoyed my group game a bit more on balance, but that will depend on your group. If you have a hard time following the story when communicating with your group, it may not be as enjoyable but we mostly were able to follow it despite talking the whole time on voice chat. The gameplay is solid, but you’re really missing out if you can’t pay attention to the narrative this game has to offer so I’d prioritize that. I found solo play easier as it gives you more control over party synergy and coordination and I was better able to engage with the story and learn the basics of gameplay and strategy. The other major difference is in a group, you have to make sure to listen in on conversations with NPCs or you simply miss story, so you have to coordinate.

87,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"Just finished this game. With my short attention span, it’s really rare to spend 91h on anything, so they must have done something right. I enjoyed most of my time playing the game and I recommend it but it surely has some flaws.

The dialogue was funny and well written. The characters had interesting stories and a lot of personality, which made you invested in solving their problems and storylines. The voice acting was also great. The visuals are pretty good. The towns, dungeons and castles are well designed and textured. I’m not really a fun of turn-based systems - fighting in RPGs to me has always been a necessary evil - but this system was not bad! It’s intuitive enough to understand what you’re doing but leaves a bit of for experimentation. The maps are very big and exploring them feels very rewarding - there’s not much of dull time spent walking around. There’s always an intriguing chest or a quirky npc that’s needs you to do something for them. The freedom in this game is something I haven’t really experienced in any other RPG - you can solve quests in many ways and you can do almost anything you can think of - steal, kill, trick, flirt, etc. I really started to have fun when I decided embrace my thief character and started to sneak into everywhere I shouldn’t be. Most times this was rewarded with loot, information and, some times, even new quests so it didn’t felt inconsequential. Other games would just give me a tag for dialogue. Of course this amount of freedom led to some bugs here and there, but nothing too game breaking.

Here are a few things that could be better (spoiller alert):
- The quest system is a bit confusing, there’s too much information and no way to filter it out.
- There’s too much googling needed. I tried to avoid cheating as much as I could but I spent a lot of time looking at my phone.
- The inventory is hard to manage and could have more filter options and marquee selection.
- Surfaces are an interesting mechanic but some of them clutter the screen. Water and ice are ok, but fire and poison, for example, are way too much - sometimes you can't even see your character.
- The ending felt underwhelming and rushed. The character stories where way more rewarding to finish than the main quest.
- The “cutscenes” could be more epic. They’re just concept art with a tiny bit of animation. Lack of budget, maybe? And why is Windego narrating?
- This is more of an opinion, but too much moral ambiguity in characters can make them all feel similar. They turn into a grey canvas with some specific motivations tossed on top. Sometimes that’s not enough to make you care.
- No more sob stories with animals, please. I almost quit playing after the finding Emmie thing. And then you throw bear cubs, pigs, little chickens… at me? No-one wants this, trust me!

Generally this is a very good game with a lot of potential, but has a few small flaws that, all together, prevent it from being an AMAZING game. 75/100",435150

Every scene/fight/encounter/quest/anything can be experienced differently in a separate playthrough, by choosing a different dialogue option or by attacking without even attempting to talk or maybe you found a mechanism you had no clue was there before and it immediately gets you past that one fight that took so long the playthrough before. 

This game is exactly what it means to be a ""[b]role-playing game[/b];"" one where you can make your characters into whatever you want, and one where your choices in a single encounter can really have an effect on nearly everything in the game that follows. My friend and I wiped out every single citizen of each town just because we felt like it and could. The downside was that it prevents us from experiencing some of the content that came from them, but it also gave us alternate ways to finish quests that would not have been previously known. 

The game is updated here and there, despite its 2017 release, with ""gift bags"" that add so much original content that I find it ridiculous. 

One more thing... [b]MODS[/b]. The mods that the community make for this game are unreal and add so much to an already incredible game. I personally recommend picking up the Crafting Overhaul mod and at least a few class mods.

All in all, this game is unlike anything I've played before and has unlimited replay value. It's just as fun solo as it is playing with a friend (or three). [b]HIGHLY[/b] recommend to anyone who loves rpg, action, adventure... I mean it's got it all. A very serious [b]10/10[/b].",435150

Immersive Story, plenty of details to explore, fun turn based combat. First Playthrough took me around 80 hours. You can sit back and dive into it just like into a good book. You might want to use a searchengine for some hints at times :). For me personally one of the best games i have ever played and except for one or two riddles i loved every single minute of it! 9/10",435150
87,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"Just finished this game. With my short attention span, it’s really rare to spend 91h on anything, so they must have done something right. I enjoyed most of my time playing the game and I recommend it but it surely has some flaws.

The dialogue was funny and well written. The characters had interesting stories and a lot of personality, which made you invested in solving their problems and storylines. The voice acting was also great. The visuals are pretty good. The towns, dungeons and castles are well designed and textured. I’m not really a fun of turn-based systems - fighting in RPGs to me has always been a necessary evil - but this system was not bad! It’s intuitive enough to understand what you’re doing but leaves a bit of for experimentation. The maps are very big and exploring them feels very rewarding - there’s not much of dull time spent walking around. There’s always an intriguing chest or a quirky npc that’s needs you to do something for them. The freedom in this game is something I haven’t really experienced in any other RPG - you can solve quests in many ways and you can do almost anything you can think of - steal, kill, trick, flirt, etc. I really started to have fun when I decided embrace my thief character and started to sneak into everywhere I shouldn’t be. Most times this was rewarded with loot, information and, some times, even new quests so it didn’t felt inconsequential. Other games would just give me a tag for dialogue. Of course this amount of freedom led to some bugs here and there, but nothing too game breaking.

Here are a few things that could be better (spoiller alert):
- The quest system is a bit confusing, there’s too much information and no way to filter it out.
- There’s too much googling needed. I tried to avoid cheating as much as I could but I spent a lot of time looking at my phone.
- The inventory is hard to manage and could have more filter options and marquee selection.
- Surfaces are an interesting mechanic but some of them clutter the screen. Water and ice are ok, but fire and poison, for example, are way too much - sometimes you can't even see your character.
- The ending felt underwhelming and rushed. The character stories where way more rewarding to finish than the main quest.
- The “cutscenes” could be more epic. They’re just concept art with a tiny bit of animation. Lack of budget, maybe? And why is Windego narrating?
- This is more of an opinion, but too much moral ambiguity in characters can make them all feel similar. They turn into a grey canvas with some specific motivations tossed on top. Sometimes that’s not enough to make you care.
- No more sob stories with animals, please. I almost quit playing after the finding Emmie thing. And then you throw bear cubs, pigs, little chickens… at me? No-one wants this, trust me!

Generally this is a very good game with a lot of potential, but has a few small flaws that, all together, prevent it from being an AMAZING game. 75/100",435150

87,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"[i]This game is really nothing short of amazing.[/i]

Every scene/fight/encounter/quest/anything can be experienced differently in a separate playthrough, by choosing a different dialogue option or by attacking without even attempting to talk or maybe you found a mechanism you had no clue was there before and it immediately gets you past that one fight that took so long the playthrough before. 

This game is exactly what it means to be a ""[b]role-playing game[/b];"" one where you can make your characters into whatever you want, and one where your choices in a single encounter can really have an effect on nearly everything in the game that follows. My friend and I wiped out every single citizen of each town just because we felt like it and could. The downside was that it prevents us from experiencing some of the content that came from them, but it also gave us alternate ways to finish quests that would not have been previously known. 

The game is updated here and there, despite its 2017 release, with ""gift bags"" that add so much original content that I find it ridiculous. 

One more thing... [b]MODS[/b]. The mods that the community make for this game are unreal and add so much to an already incredible game. I personally recommend picking up the Crafting Overhaul mod and at least a few class mods.

All in all, this game is unlike anything I've played before and has unlimited replay value. It's just as fun solo as it is playing with a friend (or three). [b]HIGHLY[/b] recommend to anyone who loves rpg, action, adventure... I mean it's got it all. A very serious [b]10/10[/b].",435150

Kill za monsters and then use their body parts to get better weapons and armor and then fight better monsters and use their parts for better weapons and armor. This is the gameplay loop.

I'll be honest this game is hard , some of these monsters will open a can of whoop-ass on you and you'll just be sitting there crying on the floor. You literally cannot spam any of your combos on the endgame monsters , how do you beat the monsters then? You learn their moveset , and when they take a breather after a strong attack and find a window to attack and punish their dumb ass. But if you get too greedy the monster will punish yo ass. Learning the patterns , dodging and punishing at the right time , the game forces you to master a fight , and it's really rewarding when you are belting a monster than tortured you for 10+ fights.

There's many playstyles and weapons you can play in this game , like greatsword : slow af , big hits , insect glaive : you have a vaulting pole you can maneuver easy , lower damage compared to GS , long sword : weeb katana. There's many more and many things the game won't even tell you like jumping off mushroom ledges and new attack combos.

I would say , if you can play with a friend or a group of friends , go for it. I would say it's a masterpiece , story is bad , that's not what it's for , The gameplay is gawwwd.

90,The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22330,"I want to preface this with an admission - I played Skyrim before I played Oblivion. When I first picked it up, I was looking to see where Bethesda had come from and was looking for another similar experience. I loaded it up and was faced with characters made of plasticine, weird dialogue and a floaty combat system that actually killed me if I just ran ahead blindly. I did not like it.

A couple of years on, I came back. I think the biggest shock for me was how different it was and I expected to understand it based on Skyrim. Oblivion is not Skyrim. It's so much more. Oblivion is colourful, funny in all the right ways and the writing... the writing for the quests is phenomenal. There are many characters that you'll find yourself remembering so much further down the line, quests that just stand out as iconic and generally a much more fantastical feeling than I ever got with Skyrim. I've loved both, but give me a choice between the two and I'll gladly step into Cyrodiil for another go. 

The combat handles like you're swinging a pool noodle, but magic is where the combat in this game shines. The level of customisation and the utility of spells is phenomenal, and when you consider how easy it can be to mod this game you can fix any niggling issues you come across. 

I don't know what it is about the NPC dialogue, but even though it's comically bad it's so warming to the heart. The characters care about the world, and even if one will sit there bringing up some major threat only to be met with a complaint about mudcrabs, they all feel connected to the place they live in. I love it.

90,The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion® Game of the Year Edition,RPG,22330,"I want to preface this with an admission - I played Skyrim before I played Oblivion. When I first picked it up, I was looking to see where Bethesda had come from and was looking for another similar experience. I loaded it up and was faced with characters made of plasticine, weird dialogue and a floaty combat system that actually killed me if I just ran ahead blindly. I did not like it.

A couple of years on, I came back. I think the biggest shock for me was how different it was and I expected to understand it based on Skyrim. Oblivion is not Skyrim. It's so much more. Oblivion is colourful, funny in all the right ways and the writing... the writing for the quests is phenomenal. There are many characters that you'll find yourself remembering so much further down the line, quests that just stand out as iconic and generally a much more fantastical feeling than I ever got with Skyrim. I've loved both, but give me a choice between the two and I'll gladly step into Cyrodiil for another go. 

The combat handles like you're swinging a pool noodle, but magic is where the combat in this game shines. The level of customisation and the utility of spells is phenomenal, and when you consider how easy it can be to mod this game you can fix any niggling issues you come across. 

I don't know what it is about the NPC dialogue, but even though it's comically bad it's so warming to the heart. The characters care about the world, and even if one will sit there bringing up some major threat only to be met with a complaint about mudcrabs, they all feel connected to the place they live in. I love it.

Introduction

1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.

3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.

4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.

5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.",489830

Has serious lag issues with menus, which never used to be there. So every menu it stutters for 5/10 seconds (on an SSD) pretty sure its having a major problem with loading the thumbnails for items and units. So every time you wanna trade, lag, every time you take prisoners, lag, every time you wanna upgrade your troops, lag.

May seem small but having this constantly with every menu you open gets seriously annoying. Id say get it because its great, and the mods will be unbelievable, but wait until they fix this damn stuttering.

92,Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"As someone who followed this project very closely on the official forums I have to say that TaleWorlds is an absolute garbage at their job. They are sidelining the community at every opportunity. They have a track record of hindering any and all attempts of their modding community at fixing their broken game and have shown actual jealousy over the work of their modding scene.
Almost two years ago TW proclaimed that custom, moddable servers can't be made now, but they'll be a thing in 2022, which prompted the modding community to making their own custom servers in few days of work, all by adding few lines of code. TW of course threw a hissy fit over it and patched it out, but it at least shown us how incompetent they are at their own jobs.
""It's early access, you have to lower your expectations"" - My expectations are so low that I had to dig a hole for them to lay in.
This game should have never been released in Early Access. You need tons of mods to make it actually feel alive and fun, something which TW is actively hindering by throwing tantrums at all Total Conversion modders, because once again - players can do a better job than the actual devs.
This whole development process is a farce from start to finish. I honestly hope that when they (maybe) eventually release their 1.6, they'll adress all these issues and stop sidelining players with corpo-talk and tantrums. But it's TaleWorlds, so the reality is that they're probably limiting our possibilities to milk us on future in-game-transactions and mediocre DLCs.
I wish we got the same treatment Warband did with Viking Conquest, which was a joined project of both the developers and the community.

Forums topics I'm referring to in the review are 'An open letter from the Kingdoms of Arda team, and the total-conversion mod community' and 'Multiplayer mods can't be made until 2022 unless we find an alternative', but there are literal hundreds other posts and topics there that show how out of touch and jaded the devs are.

92,Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"As a young boy my character was enamored by the breadth and depth of the world. Distant lands inhabited by dangerous armies, weapons warped into form by foreign designs. It was all exciting!
Then my character became a man; a sword-wielding nemesis to all opposing. And in his adulthood he elected to realize his worldly infatuation. So he traveled to far places where the weather was cold and armor expensive, to places where men rode horses and shot from a bow. Finally he arrived to a place covered in sand and swarmed by furtive caravans. Here in the sweltering heat a primordial realization, shrouded at first by an unsteady open-mindedness, approached through the desert’s feverish waves. And here my character turned around and left; trading the dusty wastes for verdant forests.

	He retired, after only a few weeks of conquest, to Sargot. In the city he disbanded his forces, wishing them good fortune and used his lingering wealth to purchase a small studio apartment. He then bought a subscription to [i] Old School Runescape [/i] and played out the rest of his days in a game which is slightly less of a fucking grind.",261550

My biggest gripe, one that almost makes me want to just quit completely: During a siege, when attacking, your troops have a couple towers with three ladders each. Your troops will only use one ladder, and even then only go up a hand full at a time which means they get immediately killed by the couple enemy troops waiting at the top. The rest of your troops are just kinda jumbled at the bottom of the tower all trying to climb the one ladder.... even though there are two more right next to it.

Constant bug fixes that show no sign of improving, no singleplayer features for increased immersion, only fewer and fewer roleplaying options. I would have left a fuming review a year ago for the unnecessary addition of the poorly-thought-out heir system, and now I have no more hope for a remedy in this game.

Even worse is the multiplayer side, the only official online modes are Skirmish and Captain, both of which became uninteresting very quickly.  Siege and Team Deathmatch still exist as custom options, but the servers themselves are programmed so poorly that you have about a 50/50 chance that the match will even finish without crashing, then a good 75% chance the server will crash between games.  Taleworlds has had so much time to work on this, yet the server stability has effectively remained the same since launch.

The great thing about this game is it's concept. Its a lot of fun if you don't care about the crashes, absolutely dogshit AI, broken sieges, and lazy quests.

""Ja"" because the game improved several aspects. The UI looks much better. They introduced a much needed siege system, in which you actually need to build siege engines to storm a castle - and it is magnificent! There are more commands to control your troops, and they added a smithing system which was severely lacking in the Warband version. They also introduced caravans which is a cool addition.

""Nein"" because teh game is still VERY raw. It is terribly optimized. On lowest settings at FHD (GTX2060) the battles stutter a lot. You have to pass a Will Roll of Diff 25 to endure playing large sieges as a PowerPoint presentation. The smithing system is simply broken. The best two handed swords you craft, using rare materials, will be ~20k worth. A JAVELIN can go as high as 180k. That breaks the economy too - once you can craft javelins you achieved infinite money.

The leveling system seems broken beyond repair and I hope the devs redo it from scratch. There are 6 attributes, each with 3 skills attached. The only purpose of the attributes is to determine how far/fast you can level its skills. You can only level skills by USING them, but as they get closer to the cap, you get a multiplier penalty, e.g. you get only 1/2, then 1/4, until you get no exp at all. To mitigate that, the devs added a ""focus points"" which increases the cap/multiplier for a single skill only (max 5 focus per skill). You get 1 focus point per level, 1 attribute point per 4 levels. The progression is non-linear i.e. the higher the level of the character/skill, the more exp points it needs to progress - but you get LESS exp points due to the multiplier penalty. To eventually get max attributes, you'd need to reach lvl 200-ish.

It is much more intuitive than it sounds. The key problem is that, to level up, you need to progress skills. But to progress skills you need to level up. The non-linear behaviour is TERRIBLY balanced. Even after cheating to get all attributes to 10 (max speed/cap to all skills), after ~40h my character is barely lvl 35 (remember, non-linear; so it gets much worse later). If you try to focus in one attribute/group of skills, you'll level up even slower. Yes, in Bannerlord, specializing is bad!

Once you create a kingdom, your lords force you to declare war on every kingdom with less troops. Lords with traits such as ""Honour"" and ""Honesty"" pass their time pillaging villages. You can also send your companions to form parties to protect your own settlements, but instead they will join the murdering as well - but IN YOUR NAME! There is no ""toggle"". You can't say ""no, bad boy, sit."" You can control some policies of your kingdom, but there is no ""Chill Daddy"" policy and everybody is bloodthirsty the whole time.

I ran out of space but I could still rant about marriage, charming/persuasion, the way the NPCs creeply smile at you as if they'd had mushrooms, the lack of armor crafting, customized troops trees and of a potato at the end of this post.

Mount & Blade is one of my favourite games of all times and Bannerlord SURELY sounds promising. However, it is better to stay away until the devs finish fixing (some of) the problems above. As it is now, it is a bad game.

92,Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"At launch, it was great fun, the only issues were AI and broken features (perks not working, stuff like that), to be expected of early access. Much time later, the features were fixed (awesome!) but the AI is still really bad, and performance has somehow become much, much worse. 

This is why I can't recommend it. I can tolerate features being broken because the gameplay is still fun, and siege AI can be overlooked because most battles aren't sieges anyway (and Warband's siege AI was bad too). But the menu lag makes the game seriously unplayable. Game lags for like 10 seconds every time you open a menu. That doesn't sound like a long time but seriously, just count to 10 right now, it's a looong time to just sit there, and this game is seriously like 50% menus, dude. It adds up REALLY quick. A good third or so of my gameplay is just me sitting waiting for the game to stop stuttering. It's also really bizarre to me that it's just menus that do this. Battles run very smoothly for me.

I'm going back to Warband I think, I'll check back on this game in like a year and maybe it will be a bit better. Would recommend others do the same.",261550

Has serious lag issues with menus, which never used to be there. So every menu it stutters for 5/10 seconds (on an SSD) pretty sure its having a major problem with loading the thumbnails for items and units. So every time you wanna trade, lag, every time you take prisoners, lag, every time you wanna upgrade your troops, lag.

May seem small but having this constantly with every menu you open gets seriously annoying. Id say get it because its great, and the mods will be unbelievable, but wait until they fix this damn stuttering.

92,Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"As someone who followed this project very closely on the official forums I have to say that TaleWorlds is an absolute garbage at their job. They are sidelining the community at every opportunity. They have a track record of hindering any and all attempts of their modding community at fixing their broken game and have shown actual jealousy over the work of their modding scene.
Almost two years ago TW proclaimed that custom, moddable servers can't be made now, but they'll be a thing in 2022, which prompted the modding community to making their own custom servers in few days of work, all by adding few lines of code. TW of course threw a hissy fit over it and patched it out, but it at least shown us how incompetent they are at their own jobs.
""It's early access, you have to lower your expectations"" - My expectations are so low that I had to dig a hole for them to lay in.
This game should have never been released in Early Access. You need tons of mods to make it actually feel alive and fun, something which TW is actively hindering by throwing tantrums at all Total Conversion modders, because once again - players can do a better job than the actual devs.
This whole development process is a farce from start to finish. I honestly hope that when they (maybe) eventually release their 1.6, they'll adress all these issues and stop sidelining players with corpo-talk and tantrums. But it's TaleWorlds, so the reality is that they're probably limiting our possibilities to milk us on future in-game-transactions and mediocre DLCs.
I wish we got the same treatment Warband did with Viking Conquest, which was a joined project of both the developers and the community.

Forums topics I'm referring to in the review are 'An open letter from the Kingdoms of Arda team, and the total-conversion mod community' and 'Multiplayer mods can't be made until 2022 unless we find an alternative', but there are literal hundreds other posts and topics there that show how out of touch and jaded the devs are. I will be posting links to the topics mentioned above below (assuming steam won't delete them)

92,Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"As a young boy my character was enamored by the breadth and depth of the world. Distant lands inhabited by dangerous armies, weapons warped into form by foreign designs. It was all exciting!
Then my character became a man; a sword-wielding nemesis to all opposing. And in his adulthood he elected to realize his worldly infatuation. So he traveled to far places where the weather was cold and armor expensive, to places where men rode horses and shot from a bow. Finally he arrived to a place covered in sand and swarmed by furtive caravans. Here in the sweltering heat a primordial realization, shrouded at first by an unsteady open-mindedness, approached through the desert’s feverish waves. And here my character turned around and left; trading the dusty wastes for verdant forests.

	He retired, after only a few weeks of conquest, to Sargot. In the city he disbanded his forces, wishing them good fortune and used his lingering wealth to purchase a small studio apartment. He then bought a subscription to [i] Old School Runescape [/i] and played out the rest of his days in a game which is slightly less of a fucking grind.",261550
92,Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"I really like this game but can't recommend it until the AI during battles, especially during sieges, is just even a little better.  
My biggest gripe, one that almost makes me want to just quit completely: During a siege, when attacking, your troops have a couple towers with three ladders each. Your troops will only use one ladder, and even then only go up a hand full at a time which means they get immediately killed by the couple enemy troops waiting at the top. The rest of your troops are just kinda jumbled at the bottom of the tower all trying to climb the one ladder.... even though there are two more right next to it. I've even tried to use my character to push them on to it but that doesn't work either. I know its early access, but it has been a year.",261550
92,Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord,Strategy,261550,"The game has been in EA for more than a year, and I bought into it first day on release. A year on I remain disappointed. Singleplayer, the soul of Warband, is all but abandoned, the multiplayer, frankly, I don't give a fuss about. Constant bug fixes that show no sign of improving, no singleplayer features for increased immersion, only fewer and fewer roleplaying options. I would have left a fuming review a year ago for the unnecessary addition of the poorly-thought-out heir system, and now I have no more hope for a remedy in this game.

Even worse is the multiplayer side, the only official online modes are Skirmish and Captain, both of which became uninteresting very quickly.  Siege and Team Deathmatch still exist as custom options, but the servers themselves are programmed so poorly that you have about a 50/50 chance that the match will even finish without crashing, then a good 75% chance the server will crash between games.  Taleworlds has had so much time to work on this, yet the server stability has effectively remained the same since launch.

94,American Truck Simulator,Simulation,270880,"[h1] By far one of the best simulation games currently on the market, [/h1]

In 2002, a small, barely known software company known as SCS Software released it's first trucking simulation game, 18 Wheels of Steel: Hard Truck. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318750/ Fast forward to 2016, and SCS has returned to its roots with American Truck Simulator. Like Euro Truck Simulator 2, Euro Truck Simulator and the multitude of 18 Wheels of Steel titles before it, American Truck Simulator continues a tradition of realistic simulation games from the now famed Czech developer/publisher. Get behind the wheel of the most popular brands of trucks, with an ever-expanding list of makes and models made available free with frequent updates combined with a constantly expanding list of states to drive through, from California to Washington to Colorado, with Wyoming and Texas on their way in the near future, it's clear that SCS has their heart and soul in both ATS and ETS 2, being what I could consider two of the most frequently updated games since their initial release dates. 

Speaking of updates, the frequency at which that SCS updates this game and it's sister title, Euro Truck Simulator 2, shows the dedication they carry and the devotion they have to their player base. Some may say it really is the #BestCommunityEver, with player counts having reached an all time high since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, and even that couldn't slow down the team as they powered through 2020 with the same positivity and dedication as they had in previous years. Combine the periodic updates improving a game built on what could be considered an [u] ancient [/u] game engine by today's standards, SCS continues to beat AAA studios at their own game in a niche market flooded with cheap imitations. This is highlighted by the recent 1.40 update, which introduced a brand new lighting system, drastically improving the realism of the game world by an unprecedented amount, and not long before that, the 1.37 update introduced the open-source FMOD sound engine, allowing for more realistic sounds to be implemented into the game.

Going back on the #BestCommunityEver, SCS continues to impress by being one of the most supportive studios when it comes to mods. That's right, a little game studio with less than 500 people based out of Prague makes games and actively supports it's modding community more than most AAA studios could even dream of, and in my opinion they even beat out Bethesda Softworks in terms of the modding tools they offer to the community, from official modelling plugins for Blender to the official Steam Workshop upload tool. They've even gone as far as to hire a number of members of the modding community, including legends like SiSL and 50keda, famous for SiSL's Mega Pack and the extensive DAF XF reworks respectively. They'll even go as far as to leave extreme detail in their patch notes for each update to inform modders of the changes they've made to the game that will affect mods as they are developed. 

If you're looking to play with friends, I would suggest the TruckersMP mod, available for both ATS and ETS 2. It receives frequent updates, and is often updated days if not weeks after each update dropped by SCS. However, if you already play TruckersMP but want something a bit more stable that will work on release day for every future update, then I highly encourage you to check out Convoys, a feature coming in update 1.41. Having previewed Convoys in the experimental branch prior to Open Beta, this is an officially supported multiplayer system, some might even liken it to co-op, complete with AI synchronization, something that TruckersMP currently lacks. Currently, Convoys only supports 8 players, a far cry from the several thousand player support across multiple servers with TruckersMP, but that doesn't mean you should count out Convoys at all. SCS promises to improve the system even further, and who knows how far they'll go with this new mode. Mod support on Convoys is currently unavailable for stability reasons, but that doesn't mean that SCS [u] will never [/u] support mods for it in future updates. It's a great alternative if you want something that's a bit more down-scaled and a bit more interactive, with roadside scenarios and detours being synchronized for each player. 

In conclusion, if you want a game that lets you work at your own pace and enjoy exploration, then there really isn't a reason for you to not pick up this game. With the starting point price $19.99  it's not going to break the bank like a AAA title might at $59.99, and the consistent updates and map expansions make American Truck Simulator a game worth investing in.",270880

Cities: Skylines does an amazing job of what its trying to achieve. A [b]proper city building[/b] game. In essence, even the business model behind this game achieves this. A game with rapid DLC production means a game with CONSTANT content and support, subsequently creating a huge modding community. These modifications change the game in incredibly meaningful ways. From intricate traffic management (TM:PE), to ULT and lighting adaptations. This allows the player to transport themselves into the most realistic, beautiful looking places you could imagine. From just a small, pitstop gas station in the desert to large transport networks and interchanges, you can make anything you might see in real life traveling in your car.

Every now and then finnicky roads, railways, and other items, will not act how you would expect making building the city quite difficult.

95,Cities: Skylines,Simulation,255710,"[h1] Cities Skylines is simply the best city building game out there! [/h1]
As a fan of all the SimCity games, I hated seeing the downfall of SimCity in 2013 but I was so grateful when this came out. No other game of this kind can compete with it.

[b] Pros: [/b] 
[b] 1. [/b] It is extremely detailed! Basically every logical thing was thought of and added by the developers. 
[b] 2. [/b] The graphics are pretty good. It's not very important for this kind of game; but still, it looks nice.
[b] 3. [/b] Map size is huge! You can spend over a hundred hours easily to build a single city. With mods, it's even bigger!
[b] 4. [/b] It comes included with a map, asset, theme, and scenario editor allowing you to easily create your own custom content. 
[b] 5. [/b] Modding support is simply the best! There are 10's of thousands of mods to pick from, allowing you to completely customize your city however you want, as well as adding new ways to play. 
6. The developers are continuing to support the game even after 6 years.

[b] Cons: [/b]
[b] 1. [/b] The game does require a beefy system to maintain playability. The larger your city becomes, the worse it gets. For myself, Playing with an RTX 3080, Ryzen 7 5800x and 32Gb of RAM, I get around 30fps in my city with 100k population. Optimization could definitely be better.
[b] 2. [/b]  There is a small amount of tutorials in game. Given it's great detail, it can take awhile for new players to learn how everything works. 
[b] 3. [/b] DLC's have gotten out of hand over the years. There are so many DLC's, that for new players it's hard to know which is even worth buying. Some of them are great and worth your consideration, others are just nearly useless and a waste of money. Not to mention, you can download mods that make some DLC worthless. It's 2021 so I suppose you can't expect much less then being flooded with more DLC to buy.

Overall, it's simply the best city building/city simulation game currently on the market. Given the nearly endless amount of mods, there is always ways to build your city better, bigger and more detailed. I highly recommend the game! Your money will be well spent.",255710

95,Cities: Skylines,Simulation,255710,"I'll keep it short.. I used to not want to try this game because I thought Sim City franchise was better. I was a Sim City Puritan, even when they released their last Sim City (which was pleasing to look at, nice to play for most part but very limited in capacity tbh). It took me few years after released of this game to get into it, with all the DLCs, Content Creator packs (Which is a great initiative, kudos to Paradox for introducing and allowing this) and I am blown away with how wonderful this game is, and how difficult and challenging it can be too. I love the dynamics of the game with everything that we do down to the granule decisions and implication that comes with it. I have no complain tbh, I wish for more contents though. More is good!

Cities: Skylines does an amazing job of what its trying to achieve. A [b]proper city building[/b] game. In essence, even the business model behind this game achieves this. A game with rapid DLC production means a game with CONSTANT content and support, subsequently creating a huge modding community. These modifications change the game in incredibly meaningful ways. From intricate traffic management (TM:PE), to ULT and lighting adaptations. This allows the player to transport themselves into the most realistic, beautiful looking places you could imagine. From just a small, pitstop gas station in the desert to large transport networks and interchanges, you can make anything you might see in real life traveling in your car.

95,Cities: Skylines,Simulation,255710,"[h1] Cities Skylines is simply the best city building game out there! [/h1]
As a fan of all the SimCity games, I hated seeing the downfall of SimCity in 2013 but I was so grateful when this came out. No other game of this kind can compete with it.

[b] Pros: [/b] 
[b] 1. [/b] It is extremely detailed! Basically every logical thing was thought of and added by the developers. 
[b] 2. [/b] The graphics are pretty good. It's not very important for this kind of game; but still, it looks nice.
[b] 3. [/b] Map size is huge! You can spend over a hundred hours easily to build a single city. With mods, it's even bigger!
[b] 4. [/b] It comes included with a map, asset, theme, and scenario editor allowing you to easily create your own custom content. 
[b] 5. [/b] Modding support is simply the best! There are 10's of thousands of mods to pick from, allowing you to completely customize your city however you want, as well as adding new ways to play. 
6. The developers are continuing to support the game even after 6 years.

[b] Cons: [/b]
[b] 1. [/b] The game does require a beefy system to maintain playability. The larger your city becomes, the worse it gets. For myself, Playing with an RTX 3080, Ryzen 7 5800x and 32Gb of RAM, I get around 30fps in my city with 100k population. Optimization could definitely be better.
[b] 2. [/b]  There is a small amount of tutorials in game. Given it's great detail, it can take awhile for new players to learn how everything works. 
[b] 3. [/b] DLC's have gotten out of hand over the years. There are so many DLC's, that for new players it's hard to know which is even worth buying. Some of them are great and worth your consideration, others are just nearly useless and a waste of money. Not to mention, you can download mods that make some DLC worthless. It's 2021 so I suppose you can't expect much less then being flooded with more DLC to buy.

Overall, it's simply the best city building/city simulation game currently on the market. Given the nearly endless amount of mods, there is always ways to build your city better, bigger and more detailed. I highly recommend the game! Your money will be well spent.",255710

After tier two, it's like running into a brickwall to progress. At this point, spending money is almost necessary to unlock planes/tanks sanely. Since Patch 1.37 in Dec 2013, Gaijin completely overhauled the research system for the sole purpose to make more money off players. Since then, everything has increased in price, and reward amounts have dropped. Tanks, aircrafts, modifications, and crew proficiencies prices have all gone up, while RP points, silver lions, and crew points are capped and less abundant. 

Balance is utter crap too. A 5.0 battle rating prop plane can meet a 6.3 post-war jet fighter. There are numerous planes under and over-tiered with discrepancies in battle rating.

Updated: Don't play this game and certainly don't purchase anything on their store. They don’t deserve the money for the experience they are giving you at this time. Still predatory as fuck

For more information, read on.






Update: Re-installed for about 2 months and uninstalled it once again.


Still predatory, Maps are more varied and you can now try to avoid the bad ones  (Up to a certain number and you can out-right ban only one or Two IIRC if you have Premium.), vehicle selection is nice still however grinding is very much a problem still and their idea of balance still insists upon making the grind worse for certain vehicles with increased repair costs and the ilk. 

The Game plays well, but it’s vehicles as they stand need to be spread out. Things are too close together and you have tanks from different eras that just don’t belong and shouldn’t fight in certain areas and the ilk. 

If you’re looking for a simulator experience stay away, it’s janky at best and over all is unsatisfying. Night Vision devices are a nice feature and help make Night Battles less painful. Helicopters are a pain, both to use and to have used on you. There are no good hard counters that can really reach out and touch them from the pedestal they sit on. You must spawn in an AA on the first round to try and make sure people aren’t ganked by a wallet warrior in their chopper. 

In lower Tiers the PE-8 is cancerous in that a squad can rush and kill early and quickly, die/’J’ Out, and then spawn in the PE-8. Then, begin using the PE-8’s to pound opposing forces into the mud with a steady whistle-boom of the largest bombs in the game. The PE-8 and it’s largest bomb NEED to be more prohibitively expensive due to how the bomb ignores cover. You can be behind a fucking hill and still get shredded. I mean in a fucking VALLEY Behind a deep hill, the bomb on the other side, and you’ll still die; On the edge of the bombs’ radius and you’ll still die. 

The game as it stands is still broken and you can’t advocate boycotting their store on their own forums in protest of how the game is to make a point. Which is fair, but they certainly can’t stop that here. 

https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/12738-war-thunder-rules/

1.1.7. Encourage other users to stop playing the game, or encourage users to avoid purchasing any content from the store, in order to prove a point.


Fuck you guys. While I won’t break you rules on your forums because, hey, it makes sense that you’d stop that kind of talk on your official forums. You can’t stop that here. I stand by what I said in my previous review with this as an update. 


I’ll still install the game haphazardly to see if you guys are making progress in addressing the issues the community is facing. Spawn Camping, Map Design issues (Players Mountain Goating and sniping into the Spawn), Spawn trapping, as well as the abuse of Helicopters. 

You guys refuse to acknowledge that Spawn Camping is a problem in this game. You have ignored us saying that we’d like free FPE or Parts or solutions that would make having those ‘modules’ less painful. Vehicles can have FPE MODELED in or ON the machine and it won’t be free. IT can be STANDARD FOR THAT MODEL OF VEHICLE AND YOU’LL STILL NOT INCLUDE IT.

Saying, “Oh, then why don’t we give everyone a Free-Abrams too.” Or some such, IIRC. 


Don’t purchase anything from the store and just in-general avoid the game. Still predatory as fuck 





Old Review:
It's fuckin' predatory in the way they handle their player base. It handles map design poorly and overall makes the game a grind with no feeling of accomplishment, just the grind. It's predatory in the way it uses its little rewards to make you want to log in every day.

Community events, while sometimes fun, are generally painful and just frustrating.

I'm uninstalling and never looking back. This game is a bad game, it's not ugly, it's just fuckin' predatory. They use what I feel like are Skinner Boxes to encourage the user to continue to play.

See:

http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/experienced-points/15510-Skinner-Boxes-and-How-Games-Use-Them

For a good explanation.

Regardless don't play it and leave it alone. The game isn't worth the effort, I've wasted time and money on this until I realized just how dumb this shit is. . . 

Fuck you Gaijin for the way you treat players.",236390
96,War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"To begin...
Do not listen to the negative reviews about all the Russian bias because the developers are Russian.

Every country is good in their own way.
For example:
Americans: Large amount of ammo, mostly acrobatic, good offence, generally bad defence
Japanese: Large amount of ammo, very acrobatic, good offence at higher calibres, very bad defence
Russians: Low amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, defence spans from good to horrible depending on plane.
British: Decent amount of ammo, acrobatic, good offence, average defence
Germans: Large amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, average defence



The game mechanics in this game are very good. 
The diversity of planes is very good.
You can play as army or aviation (tanks/ground vehicles or planes)
Diverse selection of maps 
Many gamemodes

There are 3 levels of difficulty:
Arcade - Recomended for new players who are still getting a feel for the mechanics - includes lead indicator to assist aim and planes do not rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available - enemy and friendly players stand out
Realistic - Recomended for seasoned players who understand the mechanics - does not include lead indicator, planes can rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available- friendly planes stand out, enemy planes must be close enough for the pilot to identify the type of plane
Simulator - True realism - Recommended for expert players - does not include lead indicator - locked to first person - enemy and friendly planes are not distinguishable until the player can identify them - basically simulating the WW2 battles.

The game features a tree-like unlocking system, which includes 5 tiers of planes. As the tiers go higher so does the advancement of planes. There is an option to pay real money to unlock planes, however these planes can be unlocked without paying any extra money. There are also 'premium' planes, which can either be unlocked in bundles or bought. These planes cannot be unlocked without paying real money and also grant the user bonus experience from the plane. These planes grant little advantage to the user.

The matchmaking system depends on two things.
1 - Tier of the plane
2 - Battle Ranking of the plane

If you have a tier one plane - you will be matched with tier one planes, BUT if you have a tier one plane that has a Battle Ranking of 2.3, you will be matched with Tier one and Tier two planes, which have a battle ranking of 2-2.3. This system is continued throughout the entire game.

TL;DR
The Russian Bias in this game is not anything crazy like the community has exaggerated it to be. Every country has its advantaged and disadvantages. The game is very expansive with its content and the mechanics are well made. The game has many difficulty levels targeted for new players and expert players. There are microtransactions however you will be at no disadvantage if you do not participate in them. The matchmaking system is dependant on Tier and Battle Ranking.

96,War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"I really LOVE flying, so its hard to not recommend this game but, it has some drawbacks.

War Thunder is a pay to gain an advantage game.

Like many others now, trying this shifty system of  subscriptions etc, it seems pretty effective, I see people in purchased planes all the time and you dont stand much chance in a 1 on 1 with most of them as most of them have a much heavier 1 second burst from the guns / cannons, so you in a crappy plane , you have paid nothing to develop yet, man your such a victim in this game, that is , right there the definition of pay to win or pay to gain an advantage, a definition well established from the days of DOS to current day.

Right, dont expect DCS levels of flight realism, totally different game, this game is the arcade version of flight sims, its brilliant in that regard.

What it does do is give kids a much better understanding of a 3d environment, and parents alike, lol, and it brings people together in large games where your almost never facing the same set of players twice, everyone gets jumbled in that server matching system from what I can tell.

Flying itself, for an arcade style game, is pretty damned impressive, I like that you can use a HOTAS joy or mouse or both and keyboard and all buttons Ive needed so far are bind-able, so thats a heap of great work in the backend of the game you dont usually see, done very well, almost perfect.
The game does not feel quite the same on a joystick, I find myself often just playing in the lounge on second PC with mouse, while youngling also uses the mouse, always, but when you fly with the joy, its not quite as simple to aim, but its still pretty good.

Just for pure fun, is a blast for say 2 hours a day, to get rid of that, I MUST FLY itch, lol, works wonders, that or you grab an RC plane / chopper like we have and hit the real skies !

Overall  I like the game, hate the business plan, but they did such a good job on the game itself, its still worth playing just to experience the WW2 planes and great modelling.

You can do all your planes up with custom paint jobs etc, you can buy with real money your countries own real flag for your planes etc.

",236390
96,War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"Allright.

This game. This game is testament that shitty devs can fuck up a very good game concept. I have played this game for a long time on and off. However, over the last few patches, the game really has taken a nosedive when it comes to enjoyability. 
First, the Planes, which is the most mature and well developed part of the game. the Models look great, as does the scenery. It however, has a lot of problems, first up, the way players interact with AI ground targets is mindnumbingly dumb. On each map, the AI has a predetermined winner, meaning, that without player intereference, one side will always win, as their ground units cap the objective. This is problem number one as it promotes hiding and drawing out the game, given everybody knows who wins on which maps, which means that 90% of the time, you end up chasing some AFK fuck that is lounging at 11k altitude without having done anything...
The Second major problem with planes is still, as it was in 1.25, Flight modelling. compared to the competition, its frankly terrible. Gaijin attempted to remedy this via ""Tournament standard"" flight models, but as a few tests indicate, even these are far from standard, with frankly mindboggling behavior such as a failure to stall, wonky control surfaces and odd use of superchargers. Compared to its next to competitors (IL-2 and Wargamings World of Warplanes) it falls miserably short compared to the first, while overall, not being that much better then the second, which advertises itself as a casual arcade type of sim. 
Overall, if Planes were the only thing, i'd rate the game a 6.5/10, it can be decently enjoyable, if at times, mindnumbingly frustrating.

Now onto Tanks. Which is the middle brother of the modes, and involves 2 teams usually fighting over a cap point. My first issue, cap points, unlike with planes, are completely random, consisting of a circle somewhere in the middle of nowhere, usually in the center of the map. Whereas with Planes, you got an inkling of what your actual goal is, tanks is akin to being a gladiator in an arena, with only a simple, go kill the badguys to justify your actions. This is made worse by the terrible, claustrofobic map design which is to promote the use of 1 shot killing Howitzers (that in most modes, would suffer heavily of hte shelldrop, combined with the need to guesstimate the distance) over high velocity anti tank guns. This is made even worse by the pitful zoom that you get, making putting in accurate fire at ranges over 500meters nearly impossible.
The second major issue, is the basic game mechanics of shell behavior and armor. Both are incredibly borked, and have been so from the beginning. for a Game that presents itself as historical and realistic, its very much neither. For instance, whereas In Real life, calibers of 85mm or more would overmatch sloped armor, ingame that doesn't happen except for huge calibers like the Soviet 122mm, which, combined with the aforementioned mapdesign, makes it really frustrating for anybody that wants to drive anything else then Russians. 
The Ingame T-34 needs to plant a single hit on his opponent to kill him. the British Cromwell, which frequently faces it (and for some reason, has no reverse gear) needs to plant shots into each individual crewman, because shell spalling is only a minor inconvienience, whereas explosives are teh wrath of God.
Finally, unlike WoT, the chance to bounce is not set, and is completely RNG to the point that HESH, which pancakes onto a surface, can actually bounce off an angled plate.
rating 3/10. Horrible, buggy and frustrating, not helped by devs that are more interested in pushing out content then in fixing the mode.

Now onto the devs themselves. They are bad, atleast their gamedesign is. Balance is a mess, with many over and underpowered machines sitting at ranks where they have no business to be. official response, ""balancing is done through numbers."" This has lead to the amusing situation where you had the A6M5 zero, an aircraft that has a top speed of 540kph was considered to be a balanced matchup for the P-80C shooting star, which went nearly twice as fast, had far better controls, and was supposed to go up to equivalent aircraft like the Meteor. While some of the more special ones have been removed, the point remains, there is no idea to balance it, and any suggestion about changing it is met with a resolute mocking and telling people that having biplanes facing off against B-17's is the only alternative.
In Tanks, its even worse, given that the spread is identical, which means that its not uncommon to find yourself in a position where you are outgunned and cannot do anything really, because of hte fact your gun cannot penetrate his armor from any angle. In Gaijin's view, this is considered a fair match.

96,War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"War Thunder offers a great multiplayer experience of WW2/CW aerial and tank warfare. It has to be mentioned that visuals, gameplay and optimization are top notch. This game also features the best damage model I´ve encountered in a game of this sort. Hits and casualties are visualized with a unique picture-in-picture feedback which is very satisfying. Realistic and simulator mode are offered for people that look for the realistic fun which is a big pro.

But if you want to experience the great fidelity WT offers but aren´t willing to tone down your graphics to Playstation 1 90s standard in order to stay ""competitive"" then expect to have a big spotting disadvantage and also prepare to get blasted trough foliage, smoke and even solid objects. I don´t like to shout ""hax!"" and I don´t know how bad or good really the cheating situation is in War Thunder but take a look at the very low vs high graphic comparsion screenshots or get a impression for yourself and you´ll understand how people are able to pull of those shots. It is great that Gaijin also gives the low spec players the ability to participate but low graphic settings should never give you an advantage. I really hope Gayjin will fix that.

Also tank simulator fans may be disappointed that the tank warfare has not much to do with real tank operations. Many maps and objective placement force you to fight in tight places where everyone tries to ambush each other which unfortunately relies on heavy use of the 3p camera and gamey map marking. While this is of course fun I find the lack of big wide battlegrounds and real tank battles very frustrating. There are some maps that offer this experience but the community tend to avoid or dislike them because it takes too much time and patience for spotting and calculating a proper fire solution. Time that people want to spent with the grinding.  

Which bringes me to a big problem. This game suffers from horrible research points and silver lions grind from Tier 4 upwards even with premium account and boosting Talisman or premium vehicles. To all normal people that aren´t willing to spent their whole live on one game, that have careers, activites, sports, and social life to attend, be ready to wait a long time or to invest really big sums of money in order to see your favorite high tier tank in your garage. 

I´m okay with F2P games that ask you for some cash in order to save you time but this game has a absurd and greedy pricing. Monetization all over the place. Yeah die hard fans will tell you the grind isn´t that bad and paying money is not needed. Strangely most top tier players I´ve met have spent 200 - 300 dollars on average on this game for talismans, ingame currency, premium accounts, and vehicles. 

The described cons sadly leaves a very bad impression and is the reason why I´m not getting in love with this game and have to give a negative rating. 

To be fair it has to mentioned that there is at least no real pay to win in this game. You can purchase backup vehicles or buy camouflage objects but this has not much of an impact. More important is the fact that you can´t equip your vehicles with some premium boosters or powerful ammunitions for real money like in other games.  

I´ll recommend you to aim for your favourite Tier 2/3 vehicles which are unlocked in a reasonable amount of time. Stay with this tiers, they´re really fun - gameplay and tank-mix wise - and stop worrying about the grind and the tier 5 but play the objective and for fun.",236390
96,War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"An excellent and unique game that gets worse and worse as time goes. Gaijin's lust and greed for $$$ has driven this game into an unenjoyable grindfest. After tier two, it's like running into a brickwall to progress. At this point, spending money is almost necessary to unlock planes/tanks sanely. Since Patch 1.37 in Dec 2013, Gaijin completely overhauled the research system for the sole purpose to make more money off players. Since then, everything has increased in price, and reward amounts have dropped. Tanks, aircrafts, modifications, and crew proficiencies prices have all gone up, while RP points, silver lions, and crew points are capped and less abundant. 

Balance is utter crap too. A 5.0 battle rating prop plane can meet a 6.3 post-war jet fighter. There are numerous planes under and over-tiered with discrepancies in battle rating.

Updated: Don't play this game and certainly don't purchase anything on their store. They don’t deserve the money for the experience they are giving you at this time. Still predatory as fuck

For more information, read on.






Update: Re-installed for about 2 months and uninstalled it once again.


Still predatory, Maps are more varied and you can now try to avoid the bad ones  (Up to a certain number and you can out-right ban only one or Two IIRC if you have Premium.), vehicle selection is nice still however grinding is very much a problem still and their idea of balance still insists upon making the grind worse for certain vehicles with increased repair costs and the ilk. 

The Game plays well, but it’s vehicles as they stand need to be spread out. Things are too close together and you have tanks from different eras that just don’t belong and shouldn’t fight in certain areas and the ilk. 

If you’re looking for a simulator experience stay away, it’s janky at best and over all is unsatisfying. Night Vision devices are a nice feature and help make Night Battles less painful. Helicopters are a pain, both to use and to have used on you. There are no good hard counters that can really reach out and touch them from the pedestal they sit on. You must spawn in an AA on the first round to try and make sure people aren’t ganked by a wallet warrior in their chopper. 

In lower Tiers the PE-8 is cancerous in that a squad can rush and kill early and quickly, die/’J’ Out, and then spawn in the PE-8. Then, begin using the PE-8’s to pound opposing forces into the mud with a steady whistle-boom of the largest bombs in the game. The PE-8 and it’s largest bomb NEED to be more prohibitively expensive due to how the bomb ignores cover. You can be behind a fucking hill and still get shredded. I mean in a fucking VALLEY Behind a deep hill, the bomb on the other side, and you’ll still die; On the edge of the bombs’ radius and you’ll still die. 

The game as it stands is still broken and you can’t advocate boycotting their store on their own forums in protest of how the game is to make a point. Which is fair, but they certainly can’t stop that here. 

https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/12738-war-thunder-rules/

1.1.7. Encourage other users to stop playing the game, or encourage users to avoid purchasing any content from the store, in order to prove a point.


Fuck you guys. While I won’t break you rules on your forums because, hey, it makes sense that you’d stop that kind of talk on your official forums. You can’t stop that here. I stand by what I said in my previous review with this as an update. 


I’ll still install the game haphazardly to see if you guys are making progress in addressing the issues the community is facing. Spawn Camping, Map Design issues (Players Mountain Goating and sniping into the Spawn), Spawn trapping, as well as the abuse of Helicopters. 

You guys refuse to acknowledge that Spawn Camping is a problem in this game. You have ignored us saying that we’d like free FPE or Parts or solutions that would make having those ‘modules’ less painful. Vehicles can have FPE MODELED in or ON the machine and it won’t be free. IT can be STANDARD FOR THAT MODEL OF VEHICLE AND YOU’LL STILL NOT INCLUDE IT.

Saying, “Oh, then why don’t we give everyone a Free-Abrams too.” Or some such, IIRC. 


Don’t purchase anything from the store and just in-general avoid the game. Still predatory as fuck 





Old Review:
It's fuckin' predatory in the way they handle their player base. It handles map design poorly and overall makes the game a grind with no feeling of accomplishment, just the grind. It's predatory in the way it uses its little rewards to make you want to log in every day.

Community events, while sometimes fun, are generally painful and just frustrating.

I'm uninstalling and never looking back. This game is a bad game, it's not ugly, it's just fuckin' predatory. They use what I feel like are Skinner Boxes to encourage the user to continue to play.

See:

http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/experienced-points/15510-Skinner-Boxes-and-How-Games-Use-Them

For a good explanation.

Regardless don't play it and leave it alone. The game isn't worth the effort, I've wasted time and money on this until I realized just how dumb this shit is. . . 

Fuck you Gaijin for the way you treat players.",236390
96,War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"To begin...
Do not listen to the negative reviews about all the Russian bias because the developers are Russian.

Every country is good in their own way.
For example:
Americans: Large amount of ammo, mostly acrobatic, good offence, generally bad defence
Japanese: Large amount of ammo, very acrobatic, good offence at higher calibres, very bad defence
Russians: Low amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, defence spans from good to horrible depending on plane.
British: Decent amount of ammo, acrobatic, good offence, average defence
Germans: Large amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, average defence



The game mechanics in this game are very good. 
The diversity of planes is very good.
You can play as army or aviation (tanks/ground vehicles or planes)
Diverse selection of maps 
Many gamemodes

There are 3 levels of difficulty:
Arcade - Recomended for new players who are still getting a feel for the mechanics - includes lead indicator to assist aim and planes do not rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available - enemy and friendly players stand out
Realistic - Recomended for seasoned players who understand the mechanics - does not include lead indicator, planes can rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available- friendly planes stand out, enemy planes must be close enough for the pilot to identify the type of plane
Simulator - True realism - Recommended for expert players - does not include lead indicator - locked to first person - enemy and friendly planes are not distinguishable until the player can identify them - basically simulating the WW2 battles.

The game features a tree-like unlocking system, which includes 5 tiers of planes. As the tiers go higher so does the advancement of planes. There is an option to pay real money to unlock planes, however these planes can be unlocked without paying any extra money. There are also 'premium' planes, which can either be unlocked in bundles or bought. These planes cannot be unlocked without paying real money and also grant the user bonus experience from the plane. These planes grant little advantage to the user.

The matchmaking system depends on two things.
1 - Tier of the plane
2 - Battle Ranking of the plane

If you have a tier one plane - you will be matched with tier one planes, BUT if you have a tier one plane that has a Battle Ranking of 2.3, you will be matched with Tier one and Tier two planes, which have a battle ranking of 2-2.3. This system is continued throughout the entire game.

TL;DR
The Russian Bias in this game is not anything crazy like the community has exaggerated it to be. Every country has its advantaged and disadvantages. The game is very expansive with its content and the mechanics are well made. The game has many difficulty levels targeted for new players and expert players. There are microtransactions however you will be at no disadvantage if you do not participate in them. The matchmaking system is dependant on Tier and Battle Ranking.

96,War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"I really LOVE flying, so its hard to not recommend this game but, it has some drawbacks.

War Thunder is a pay to gain an advantage game.

Like many others now, trying this shifty system of  subscriptions etc, it seems pretty effective, I see people in purchased planes all the time and you dont stand much chance in a 1 on 1 with most of them as most of them have a much heavier 1 second burst from the guns / cannons, so you in a crappy plane , you have paid nothing to develop yet, man your such a victim in this game, that is , right there the definition of pay to win or pay to gain an advantage, a definition well established from the days of DOS to current day.

Right, dont expect DCS levels of flight realism, totally different game, this game is the arcade version of flight sims, its brilliant in that regard.

What it does do is give kids a much better understanding of a 3d environment, and parents alike, lol, and it brings people together in large games where your almost never facing the same set of players twice, everyone gets jumbled in that server matching system from what I can tell.

Flying itself, for an arcade style game, is pretty damned impressive, I like that you can use a HOTAS joy or mouse or both and keyboard and all buttons Ive needed so far are bind-able, so thats a heap of great work in the backend of the game you dont usually see, done very well, almost perfect.
The game does not feel quite the same on a joystick, I find myself often just playing in the lounge on second PC with mouse, while youngling also uses the mouse, always, but when you fly with the joy, its not quite as simple to aim, but its still pretty good.

Just for pure fun, is a blast for say 2 hours a day, to get rid of that, I MUST FLY itch, lol, works wonders, that or you grab an RC plane / chopper like we have and hit the real skies !

Overall  I like the game, hate the business plan, but they did such a good job on the game itself, its still worth playing just to experience the WW2 planes and great modelling.

You can do all your planes up with custom paint jobs etc, you can buy with real money your countries own real flag for your planes etc.

",236390
96,War Thunder,Simulation,236390,"Allright.

This game. This game is testament that shitty devs can fuck up a very good game concept. I have played this game for a long time on and off. However, over the last few patches, the game really has taken a nosedive when it comes to enjoyability. 
First, the Planes, which is the most mature and well developed part of the game. the Models look great, as does the scenery. It however, has a lot of problems, first up, the way players interact with AI ground targets is mindnumbingly dumb. On each map, the AI has a predetermined winner, meaning, that without player intereference, one side will always win, as their ground units cap the objective. This is problem number one as it promotes hiding and drawing out the game, given everybody knows who wins on which maps, which means that 90% of the time, you end up chasing some AFK fuck that is lounging at 11k altitude without having done anything...
The Second major problem with planes is still, as it was in 1.25, Flight modelling. compared to the competition, its frankly terrible. Gaijin attempted to remedy this via ""Tournament standard"" flight models, but as a few tests indicate, even these are far from standard, with frankly mindboggling behavior such as a failure to stall, wonky control surfaces and odd use of superchargers. Compared to its next to competitors (IL-2 and Wargamings World of Warplanes) it falls miserably short compared to the first, while overall, not being that much better then the second, which advertises itself as a casual arcade type of sim. 
Overall, if Planes were the only thing, i'd rate the game a 6.5/10, it can be decently enjoyable, if at times, mindnumbingly frustrating.

Now onto Tanks. Which is the middle brother of the modes, and involves 2 teams usually fighting over a cap point. My first issue, cap points, unlike with planes, are completely random, consisting of a circle somewhere in the middle of nowhere, usually in the center of the map. Whereas with Planes, you got an inkling of what your actual goal is, tanks is akin to being a gladiator in an arena, with only a simple, go kill the badguys to justify your actions. This is made worse by the terrible, claustrofobic map design which is to promote the use of 1 shot killing Howitzers (that in most modes, would suffer heavily of hte shelldrop, combined with the need to guesstimate the distance) over high velocity anti tank guns. This is made even worse by the pitful zoom that you get, making putting in accurate fire at ranges over 500meters nearly impossible.
The second major issue, is the basic game mechanics of shell behavior and armor. Both are incredibly borked, and have been so from the beginning. for a Game that presents itself as historical and realistic, its very much neither. For instance, whereas In Real life, calibers of 85mm or more would overmatch sloped armor, ingame that doesn't happen except for huge calibers like the Soviet 122mm, which, combined with the aforementioned mapdesign, makes it really frustrating for anybody that wants to drive anything else then Russians. 
The Ingame T-34 needs to plant a single hit on his opponent to kill him. the British Cromwell, which frequently faces it (and for some reason, has no reverse gear) needs to plant shots into each individual crewman, because shell spalling is only a minor inconvienience, whereas explosives are teh wrath of God.
Finally, unlike WoT, the chance to bounce is not set, and is completely RNG to the point that HESH, which pancakes onto a surface, can actually bounce off an angled plate.
rating 3/10. Horrible, buggy and frustrating, not helped by devs that are more interested in pushing out content then in fixing the mode.

Now onto the devs themselves. They are bad, atleast their gamedesign is. Balance is a mess, with many over and underpowered machines sitting at ranks where they have no business to be. official response, ""balancing is done through numbers."" This has lead to the amusing situation where you had the A6M5 zero, an aircraft that has a top speed of 540kph was considered to be a balanced matchup for the P-80C shooting star, which went nearly twice as fast, had far better controls, and was supposed to go up to equivalent aircraft like the Meteor. While some of the more special ones have been removed, the point remains, there is no idea to balance it, and any suggestion about changing it is met with a resolute mocking and telling people that having biplanes facing off against B-17's is the only alternative.
In Tanks, its even worse, given that the spread is identical, which means that its not uncommon to find yourself in a position where you are outgunned and cannot do anything really, because of hte fact your gun cannot penetrate his armor from any angle. In Gaijin's view, this is considered a fair match.

But if you want to experience the great fidelity WT offers but aren´t willing to tone down your graphics to Playstation 1 90s standard in order to stay ""competitive"" then expect to have a big spotting disadvantage and also prepare to get blasted trough foliage, smoke and even solid objects. I don´t like to shout ""hax!"" and I don´t know how bad or good really the cheating situation is in War Thunder but take a look at the very low vs high graphic comparsion screenshots or get a impression for yourself and you´ll understand how people are able to pull of those shots. It is great that Gaijin also gives the low spec players the ability to participate but low graphic settings should never give you an advantage. I really hope Gayjin will fix that.

Also tank simulator fans may be disappointed that the tank warfare has not much to do with real tank operations. Many maps and objective placement force you to fight in tight places where everyone tries to ambush each other which unfortunately relies on heavy use of the 3p camera and gamey map marking. While this is of course fun I find the lack of big wide battlegrounds and real tank battles very frustrating. There are some maps that offer this experience but the community tend to avoid or dislike them because it takes too much time and patience for spotting and calculating a proper fire solution. Time that people want to spent with the grinding.  

Which bringes me to a big problem. This game suffers from horrible research points and silver lions grind from Tier 4 upwards even with premium account and boosting Talisman or premium vehicles. To all normal people that aren´t willing to spent their whole live on one game, that have careers, activites, sports, and social life to attend, be ready to wait a long time or to invest really big sums of money in order to see your favorite high tier tank in your garage. 

I´m okay with F2P games that ask you for some cash in order to save you time but this game has a absurd and greedy pricing. Monetization all over the place. Yeah die hard fans will tell you the grind isn´t that bad and paying money is not needed. Strangely most top tier players I´ve met have spent 200 - 300 dollars on average on this game for talismans, ingame currency, premium accounts, and vehicles. 

The described cons sadly leaves a very bad impression and is the reason why I´m not getting in love with this game and have to give a negative rating. 

To be fair it has to mentioned that there is at least no real pay to win in this game. You can purchase backup vehicles or buy camouflage objects but this has not much of an impact. More important is the fact that you can´t equip your vehicles with some premium boosters or powerful ammunitions for real money like in other games.  

I´ll recommend you to aim for your favourite Tier 2/3 vehicles which are unlocked in a reasonable amount of time. Stay with this tiers, they´re really fun - gameplay and tank-mix wise - and stop worrying about the grind and the tier 5 but play the objective and for fun.",236390

Factorio, for example, is a pretty clever game, and I don't mean to knock it, but I quickly lost interest because it didn't really feel as though there was anything cool to work towards. As in, it felt like the purpose of the factory was just the factory itself. There may have been some hazy end goal, but there was nothing in between to spark my awe- just endless automation.

Dyson Sphere Program takes the creative problem-solving/logistics planning aspects of the factory game genre and just, in my humble opinion, sparks it to its fullest potential (almost- there is always room for improvement, but we'll get there). In this game, you aren't [i]just[/i] automating things to be as efficient and organized and convenient as possible- you're still doing plenty of that of course, but along the way you also get to build incredible sci-fi devices. Launching thousands of solar sails to orbit around your nearest star to gather energy for you, upgrading your mech to travel between solar systems at warp speed, building vast networks of automated drones to deliver resources between planets for you- it's not solely about the planning, there are also actual moments of cathartic, exciting payoff that come to you frequently by just being an immensely cool game on a conceptual level.

If you are new to the genre (I am relatively new considering I gave up on others before overcoming their main hurdles), this game will be challenging to approach. I distinctly remember a point about six or so hours in where I [i]almost[/i] gave up and quit because I felt like there was just too much stuff to figure out at once and I didn't know my next step and I just had no idea where to go next. But I stuck it out and just started researching the coolest looking thing, and the next day (a weekend) ten hours went by of me playing and hardly noticing. So basically what you should take from this is that you should go into this game with the determination to overcome a steep learning curve, or just recognize that it's probably not your cup of tea.

Now, the negatives. I personally find space travel annoying and stressful. Being trapped in space, drifting into an infinite void with no hope in sight, scares me on a deep psychological level, so when I have to travel between planets with nothing but a finite tank of fuel and the possibility that I might accidentally miss my target and be slingshotted around its orbit into vast darkness, the rational part of my brain tells me I can just load a save, but the ape part of my brain is annoyed that my management game is now a horror game. I'd like a technology in the research tree that can shuttle the player automatically between planets, mostly for my own sanity.

The second thing is mostly a Early Access-type thing that I'm sure will be improved on in the future- I want more endgame tech to exist, like the ability to destroy entire planets to gain all their resources in one fell swoop, or create wormholes for instant teleportation between points in space, or create entire planet-sized space stations (yeah 2/3 of those suggestions is just describing the Death Star, deal with it); things like that which actually require access to the immense energy of a Dyson Sphere will add a ton more spice to the game (which of course already has plenty, but there can never be too much).

The final thing is actually something that is not in the game yet but will be- please don't add combat. I know I'm probably in the minority here but the game is complex enough without that on top of it. Maybe as like, a rare event in specific locations it would be fine but for it to be a constant nuisance that threatens to destroy parts of one's factory at any moment is just too annoying to even think about.

All in all, game looks visually incredible, haven't noticed a single substantial bug, very complex and interesting to play. If the idea of creating vast automatic factories that can create anything you want on a whim and can span multiple planets, with the goal of turning entire stars into your own personal generator intrigues you, I highly recommend giving this a try.",1366540

100,Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"  I've always had a fascination with astronomy, engineering and physics but this took it to a new level. The idea of a dyson sphere was always one of the most alluring concepts to me as far as future tech was concerned. To live in a day and age where a society can collaborate so perfectly that it could create such a structure felt like a dream to me, but this game gave me a window into that dream. To be able to exist in world where even hypothetically, as a collective we can create a theoretical concept for the future, regardless of whether humanity will ever get there, it gives me a little hope for a possible future. 

  I never played games like this before. Builders and factory games were never something that even crossed my path, let one drew me in. But this game opened doors for me; gave me ideas. Plus the concept of being a lone individual with such a God like power to shape your part of the universe, carving out planets and owning stars, while you contribute to the whole of the galaxy along side other engineers in their own cluster is a very empowering idea.

  The gameplay mechanics are phenomenal. The limitless possibilities of factoring in resources from planets across multiple star systems. Planning to create massive structures with nigh infinite power at your disposal. Harnessing the power of the sun itself in the palm of your hands, then exploring further to touch another. 

  This game has so much potential and it's still only in early access. If you have a head for a game like this, or if you are looking to try something new it's definitely worth the inexpensive price tag.

100,Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"Let me compare this game to Factorio from my, subjective perspective.

While I always loved the concept of Factorio I never played it for long because it had a few critical flaws in my eyes: it was ugly, every run looked basically the same, it had no real goal at the end and - the worst - it wasn't rewarding - by that I mean you don't get cool things (with exception of drones, car and maybe weapons if you care to deal with critters), just more things to manage with even more complicated and tedious logistic management. I was always getting bored very fast and moved on to do something different.

Now, is Dyson Sphere Project better than factorio?

I think it is, at least for most cases. While there are no enemies, I don't think it is inferior to Factorio in this case - no fighting is better than bad fighting. 
The most important thing for me is that the game just feels more like it respect your time and enjoyment. You get constrution drones with big radius from the very start - if you want to make a conveor belt over the continent, you just need to designate start and end and then wait some time for your drones do to it. For smaller projects it's barely noticeable.
Finally, there are some goals you can actually see there - if you get this technology, you will be able to fly from star to star. How cool is that? This is something for which I am willing to play the game to get it. Of course it might not be enough for everyone but for me, it certainly is.

To conclude, do I recommend the game in current state? Yes. Do I think you should pay the full price for it? If you are like me, an engineering student with strong interest astronomy, yes. If not, wait some time.",1366540

You also will not find a game much better supported by modders than this one.  The only thing it is missing is the farmer's wife bringing a pitcher of cold lemonade to him in the field.",787860

101,Farming Simulator 19,Simulation,787860,I played 250+ hours on FS19. I found it really easy to add mods and host servers for mates. The game was very easy to adapt to controller wise and machine wise. The only issue i/we had was graphics. The game lacked on FPS at most times when around 4 people were on the server. Even with farms being on complete opposite sides of the maps we still had major FPS loss and lag. Minus the FPS issue the game was pretty fun. It can get repetitive here and there but mods can help. Overall i give it a 7/10 game-play wise and a 5/10 graphic/FPS,787860

If you like playing as god, and like working on cars without doing the tedious stuff (or working on literally any French car), then this is the game for you.

In all seriousness, this game helps you learn a lot about the different parts of cars and what they do. I'm no mechanic, I just got a lot of experience on repairing my own cars because they've either been French or just old run down junkboxes on wheels. But this is enjoyable. It's satisfying refurbishing cars, and rebuilding engines. Obviously, it doesn't cover absolutely every aspect. But it will probably give you a much better idea of what the mechanic's telling you when you ever have to take your own car into a garage irl, instead of going ""Oh yeah, oh ok, yeah replace whatever tf that is please"".

Great game to pass the time, and also learn a bit about cars on the side.

102,Car Mechanic Simulator 2018,Simulation,645630,"I usually wait until I beat a game to write a review for it, but this is not exactly a game that one ""beats"" in the traditional sense. CMS2018 is exactly what it says it is: You take the role of yourself, starting with a small humble garage with a single car lift, and just about $4,000 to your name. It takes me back to my youth of Snap-Ons Gearhead Garage (http://www.gearheadgarage.com/).

I grabbed this on a sale and I think I paid around $10 for it, and it's worth every penny. The game is really separated into a few smaller meta-games.

On one hand, you've got your phone orders; these are customers that need help with their cars. Obviously as the game starts off you do things like perform basic brake service, changing oil and filters, and very minor improvements. On the other hand; you've got complete car restorations. I mean sex is great and all, but have you bought an old rusted 1962 AC Cobra from an old barn and restored it to 100% of it's former glory with a complete rebuild and then turned around and sold it for a tidy $80K profit?

As you complete jobs, you earn experience and you level up, which provides you with talent points you can use to do things like move faster, unscrew things quicker, and even expand your garage. The expansion of the garage is the most satisfying thing as it often results in unlocking other great features, like the engine pulling crane, the battery charger, and eventually the interior detail shop or the body shop/paint shop.

I have only put about 23 hours into CMS2018 and I feel satisfied with my purchase. The game is enjoyable. It's a zen garden but with bolts and rust instead of plants. It's a fun way to wind down after a stressful day at work.

I will admit, the game is not without it's flaws: The music is terrifyingly bad (in my own opinion) and there is some strange UI lag from time to time. There is also an unreasonable painful grind to get to level 30 (the level in which you unlock the body and paint shop). I often found myself finishing every single order I could as quickly I as I could, regardless of what the customer wanted - even if it meant doing the most bare minimum, JUST to get the XP.

104,Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"I finally upgraded to FM21 after skipping FM19 & 20 - mostly it was the xG feature that piqued my interest, but I also like to update every so often for little things like competition rule/qualification changes, refreshing rosters, etc. Coming from FM18, I've been pleasantly surprised at some of the new features added in FM21 - not only do I really enjoy the xG thing, I love the overall improvement in what I'd call ""realism"": The interaction with staff continues to get better and better, the way staff and management present you with reports and call meetings is awesome, and the scouting meetings before transfer windows are so damn cool. It all combines to make you feel like you're actually a manager and not just playing a game. I'm at around 230 hours of FM21 and I'm still constantly finding myself engaging with new things. 

Last, I'd just like to share my experience/thoughts on scum-saving. For the most part during my thousands of hours of FM over the years, I felt like I was pretty fair about reloading matches - I only tended to do it if I had a bad injury to a star I'd just signed, or conceded a BS glitch/bug goal, etc. Sometimes if I was having a bad day and fired up FM only to be down 4-0 to Man City in the 35th minute I'd just Ctl-Alt-Delete and replay the match a few days later. But with my new save in FM21, I've been experimenting with a strict no-save-scumming policy, and it's added a whole new compelling element to my gameplay. I had a real stinker of a game against Newcastle (5-0 I think) - the sort of game I'd have been tempted to reload in the past - and a day later my players refunded the supporters' tickets for the match. How cool is that!? I also got to within one bad result of getting sacked, and had to get something away at Sheffield Utd - what a nerve-racking match that was! My boys pulled out a 3-1 win to keep me alive, and we had a short run of good form to finish the season, allowing me to get the transfer reinforcements I desperately needed. 

So TL;DR: FM is hands down the best sports management sim on the market, I felt it was well worth the money to upgrade from FM18 to FM21, and if you've never experimented with a no-save-scum policy - give it a whirl. I think you'll find it rewarding.",1263850
104,Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Football Manager 2021 hasn’t really rocked the boat in terms of enhancing the matchday gaming experience from last year. Games are as  difficult as ever to manage, and the minutiae of detail is just as overwhelming as always. Rather than a complete overhaul, there are numerous minor tweaks in Football Manager 2021, affecting tactical exploration and simulation. This time around, energy levels in particular seem to play a greater role, presumably to combat previously effective pressing tactics. In other words,  you can’t rely on your tried-and-tested methods from last year to get by.

Football Manager 2021‘s biggest change seems to come in the way that you, as a Manager, communicate. Gone are the meaningless emotions while addressing people; instead, your decisions are broken down into what really matters. While talking to players, the boardroom or press, you can respond in a much more clear way. You’ll be able to choose from responses that are positive, negative, convincing, or even backing down. Better yet, the intended meaning of everything you say is clearly laid out.

The communication overhaul really adds a lot to how you are judged as a manager in Football Manager 2021. Yes, results are still important, but you can really change the parameters of what your personal success is. If you aren’t doing especially well but are achieving the promises you have set out, you will be given more time.

This happened to me; in my first season of managing, I had slightly underachieved. But because I had delivered on my promise to repair the financial damage of the over bloated squad, I wasn’t kicked out at the end of the season where I might’ve been in previous instalments. The next season, having been able to gain control of the finances, I was able to cultivate success. This is a new experience for me in a Football Manager game; a series I’ve been playing for over a decade. While I may have improved the finances of a club before, I have never overtly communicated my goals to the boardroom and insisted on time to deliver.

Football Manager 2021 has done something that great managers do: it has acknowledged its weaknesses and improved upon them without completely rocking the boat. It still feels truly familiar as a Football Manager game, but the overhaul to expectations and communication makes for a more coherent and impactful experience. There’s more of a focus on what you say and do in your role as a manager and, over seasons, your performance is better judged. It makes a real difference to how the game can play out. The matchday experience may not be massively improved, but the improved focus elsewhere makes a real difference. For anyone who truly likes to get into the role of manager, Football Manager 2021 is a must.",1263850
104,Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Football manager 2021 is another great hit that again showcases as poor the Fifa games currently are.

This game provides a fair and balanced system which lets you do well if you know what your doing and are prepared for opposition but if you try and speed it: you get really something back for being bad.

I enjoy the ethic of always improving. I feel very immersed and determined to become a better manager. For example, I had a bad playoff season with Nashville in the MLS.

104,Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Imagine playing Leeds on the final day of the season as Brighton manager. Your best player and top goalscorer is missing through injury. You must beat Leeds to win the league after an outstanding season. its 0-0 but then Leeds strike in the 67th minute to go 1-0 up. You begin your heart starting to break. But then out of nowhere, Lewis Dunk rises from a corner on the 79th minute to equalise. There's a glimmer of hope restored. Man Utd fans hear of your equaliser in their game and become anxious. The 90th minute arrives and its still 1-1. You can hear Man Utd's fans celebrating already. You have a freekick on the edge of the box though ..... MacAllister steps up. ITS IN!!!!! Its the last kick off the game!!

104,Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"It pains me to write this but after spending more than 400 hours I have to admit: it's a poorly designed game with artifical difficulty spikes designed to keep players engaged. You can be the by far best team in the league and you will always have a seasonal rival (undocumented in-game) which will keep the pace with you. You can be a heavy-weight in a small league and there will be a team which is not better than any other in competitions which will go with the same results as you. 

Worst part when the game decides that it should boost your real rival. I have just one example of it: playing in UPL with Shakhtar I managed to finish the season with 28 wins and 2 draws in the 30 games. Guess what was the gap with Dynamo Kiev? 2 points. The third place was like 20 points lower. A season before I lost the league to Vorskla - it had lost points in 4 games through the whole season and my only loss was to them. I had numerous finishings in previous seasons with different teams when on the last match day the leader was losing, my team coming second won and then the third team became the first on goal difference, winning 5-0 and scoring its last goal on the last minutes in injury time. I get that it happens in football, see Man City and Aguero, but not in the course of couple of seasons in a row.

Apart of that the game is addicting as ever although SI doesn't care for bug fixing (top managers have like perpetual contracts, in my 15 season save Simeone, Conte, OGS, Pochettino and Flick ALL were managing their starting cubs) and their UI designer clearly hates people - I can't find any reason to make the UI overloaded mess in dark purple color. In 2021 SI didn't even care to add additional skins leaving it to fans. Really, you become so lazy? You had to tweak a couple of lines of code to do that.

Match engine looks much better until you realize that it relies heavily on the patterns. If you get that patterns, you can exploit it, and if you want to keep it natural you will face artificial difficulty spikes. Maybe in 2000s it was the same, I don't know, it all felt like an unscripted free flow and now you can guess the outcome of episode 90% times the 3D field appears.

Tactics make no sense, as you can't play defensive football relying to soak the pressure - it's instantly punished by the opposition. Players with 5 in long shots suddenly pull of Roberto Carlos if you play defensive and there is no way to explain it but the match engine flaws. If the game decides that it's time to score, it will score. To play attacking you should do counter-intuitive things (deep defensive line and low pressure against the last team in a league is a must or you will be heavily beaten with the magic 30-meter screamers).

On top of that you have the SI community forums with extremely gatekeeping audience which is intolerable to any criticism of their game. Moderators delete negative comments claiming they welcome meaningful discussion and constructive criticism. Like, I'm a paying customer who gets banned for stating that I'm not that happy with what I've payed for. In all my years online I've never seen more toxic and hostile community - even Reddit is friendly and supportive in comparison. Think twice before sponsoring it. I was a big fan of FM in 2005 - 2012 editions, I haven't really played for 8 years and I had over 700 extremely frustrating and unrewarding hours in 2020/21 versions. I won't buy it before they fix the UI and fire their UI designer. I can't possibly recommend the game which is made with the goal to frustrate the players and encourage exploits.",1263850

104,Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"I finally upgraded to FM21 after skipping FM19 & 20 - mostly it was the xG feature that piqued my interest, but I also like to update every so often for little things like competition rule/qualification changes, refreshing rosters, etc. Coming from FM18, I've been pleasantly surprised at some of the new features added in FM21 - not only do I really enjoy the xG thing, I love the overall improvement in what I'd call ""realism"": The interaction with staff continues to get better and better, the way staff and management present you with reports and call meetings is awesome, and the scouting meetings before transfer windows are so damn cool. It all combines to make you feel like you're actually a manager and not just playing a game. I'm at around 230 hours of FM21 and I'm still constantly finding myself engaging with new things. 

Last, I'd just like to share my experience/thoughts on scum-saving. For the most part during my thousands of hours of FM over the years, I felt like I was pretty fair about reloading matches - I only tended to do it if I had a bad injury to a star I'd just signed, or conceded a BS glitch/bug goal, etc. Sometimes if I was having a bad day and fired up FM only to be down 4-0 to Man City in the 35th minute I'd just Ctl-Alt-Delete and replay the match a few days later. But with my new save in FM21, I've been experimenting with a strict no-save-scumming policy, and it's added a whole new compelling element to my gameplay. I had a real stinker of a game against Newcastle (5-0 I think) - the sort of game I'd have been tempted to reload in the past - and a day later my players refunded the supporters' tickets for the match. How cool is that!? I also got to within one bad result of getting sacked, and had to get something away at Sheffield Utd - what a nerve-racking match that was! My boys pulled out a 3-1 win to keep me alive, and we had a short run of good form to finish the season, allowing me to get the transfer reinforcements I desperately needed. 

So TL;DR: FM is hands down the best sports management sim on the market, I felt it was well worth the money to upgrade from FM18 to FM21, and if you've never experimented with a no-save-scum policy - give it a whirl. I think you'll find it rewarding.",1263850
104,Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"Football Manager 2021 hasn’t really rocked the boat in terms of enhancing the matchday gaming experience from last year. Games are as  difficult as ever to manage, and the minutiae of detail is just as overwhelming as always. Rather than a complete overhaul, there are numerous minor tweaks in Football Manager 2021, affecting tactical exploration and simulation. This time around, energy levels in particular seem to play a greater role, presumably to combat previously effective pressing tactics. In other words,  you can’t rely on your tried-and-tested methods from last year to get by.

Football Manager 2021‘s biggest change seems to come in the way that you, as a Manager, communicate. Gone are the meaningless emotions while addressing people; instead, your decisions are broken down into what really matters. While talking to players, the boardroom or press, you can respond in a much more clear way. You’ll be able to choose from responses that are positive, negative, convincing, or even backing down. Better yet, the intended meaning of everything you say is clearly laid out.

The communication overhaul really adds a lot to how you are judged as a manager in Football Manager 2021. Yes, results are still important, but you can really change the parameters of what your personal success is. If you aren’t doing especially well but are achieving the promises you have set out, you will be given more time.

This happened to me; in my first season of managing, I had slightly underachieved. But because I had delivered on my promise to repair the financial damage of the over bloated squad, I wasn’t kicked out at the end of the season where I might’ve been in previous instalments. The next season, having been able to gain control of the finances, I was able to cultivate success. This is a new experience for me in a Football Manager game; a series I’ve been playing for over a decade. While I may have improved the finances of a club before, I have never overtly communicated my goals to the boardroom and insisted on time to deliver.

Football Manager 2021 has done something that great managers do: it has acknowledged its weaknesses and improved upon them without completely rocking the boat. It still feels truly familiar as a Football Manager game, but the overhaul to expectations and communication makes for a more coherent and impactful experience. There’s more of a focus on what you say and do in your role as a manager and, over seasons, your performance is better judged. It makes a real difference to how the game can play out. The matchday experience may not be massively improved, but the improved focus elsewhere makes a real difference. For anyone who truly likes to get into the role of manager, Football Manager 2021 is a must.",1263850

This game provides a fair and balanced system which lets you do well if you know what your doing and are prepared for opposition but if you try and speed it: you get really something back for being bad.

I enjoy the ethic of always improving. I feel very immersed and determined to become a better manager. For example, I had a bad playoff season with Nashville in the MLS. I got so annoyed because we lost to a trash team so I berated the players and got rid of dead wood. I then signed top prospects and I'm now in the running of finishing 1st in the supporter's shield.

See, I downloaded this game for my VR because i'd been getting bullied and despite my hopes not being high at all, I thought this game would be a good way to let off my steam. Boy was I surprised. After playing short playtime on this game (a mere 0.6 hours) my muscle mass and fighting ability instantly skyrocketed. The next day when I went to school, I greeted my bully like every other day except now I tower over him. Literally last week he was way huger than me. He was surprised to see me in such a state and I had eyes all over me. I took this as the perfect time to get my revenge and gave him a nice punch to the stomach, sending him flying backwards into the lockers. There was a long silence until everyone around me started clapping and cheering my name.

106,The Thrill of the Fight - VR Boxing,Sports,494150,"By playing this game. The constant movement and swift punches with my arms allowed me to grow muscle mass.

See, I downloaded this game for my VR because i'd been getting bullied and despite my hopes not being high at all, I thought this game would be a good way to let off my steam. Boy was I surprised. After playing short playtime on this game (a mere 0.6 hours) my muscle mass and fighting ability instantly skyrocketed. The next day when I went to school, I greeted my bully like every other day except now I tower over him. Literally last week he was way huger than me. He was surprised to see me in such a state and I had eyes all over me. I took this as the perfect time to get my revenge and gave him a nice punch to the stomach, sending him flying backwards into the lockers. There was a long silence until everyone around me started clapping and cheering my name. All thanks to this game was I able to make this possible and now since then I have earned myself a hot girlfriend and the bully is now my student who has completely reformed and whom I give boxing lessons too. Thank you sealost interactive for making this game and saving my school life.",494150
106,The Thrill of the Fight - VR Boxing,Sports,494150,"I love boxing, it is hands down my favourite sport. And this here is what you expect from a boxing VR game! I'm using proper technique and combinations to defeat each opponent while scoring a great workout at the same time. My only criticism is that there is limited content and blocking in-game isn't as good as it could be. But that criticism is very nick picky as the rest of the mechanics come together so well! Like I said, using proper boxing techniques really pay off with how this game has been made.

I've been playing this one from early access and the developers have done an outstanding job. What blows me away more than anything is the price, $14.50AUD is a steal! If you love boxing IRL or want a solid work out, don't even think about it, just get it!",494150

The problem is the inconsistencies with the games swing timing and swing path. It's either too sensitive, or too shot dependent. The concept is good, just not implemented the best. 

PGA career is okay, except wildly unrealistic. You can be -10 through 9 holes and Justin Thomas will be right behind you at -9 somehow. If you shoot +5 then the leaders start losing strokes and will sit at like -5 and wait for you to catch up and then they start nailing eagles and birdies again. 

The game feels alive at times with the crowd, but at the same time so empty. You can't play rounds with AI golfers. A feature I very much miss with the old Tiger Woods PGA games. You can however play online matches against script modding hackers who you cannot beat which is cool. And that's about all I'll say about multiplayer.

109,DJMAX RESPECT V,Sports,960170,"New players BEWARE!

There are a lot of other negative reviews of this game, and I think they're all very spot on, but I want to touch on something that not many folks here in the reviews are mentioning which is:

This game is incredibly anti-newcomer. Yes, it looks pretty. Yes, it looks assessable... but beware, because if you purchase this game as a person new to rhythm games looking to get better at them, then you're in the wrong place and you better reconsider and look at playing a free alternative(like OSU!Mania). 

This is the biggest thing that bugs me about DJMAX.

It's honestly such a slap in the face when you come to realization that the only way you can even hope to get better at the game is to stagnantly repeat songs in freestyle that you're comfortable with and slowly move up. Yes, you do get better over time, but I have to argue here that this isn't any effective nor efficient training for the time and effort you put in. NO player wants to feel like they're stuck in a game since that would defeat the purpose of a game being a game, and lol guess what, neowiz is doing exactly that for the newcomers

There's absolutely no way to practice this game efficiently. If you find a song that has only a really hard part towards the end of the track then guess what, you're outta luck. You can play freestyle mode and just keep failing until you get it sometime in the uncertain future I guess... If you really want to practice that part then you'd have to go search YT videos and tap along to a video which I find to be completely inconvenient. Air mode is also a 'no fail' mode, BUT you can't really choose a song you want. And online player lobbies are good option as it is a no fail mode, but you kinda need friends, and I have none :(

All the options I listed above are just not convenient or efficient at all. When I say ""practice/train"", I mean that I would like to sit down and hard practice complex patterns on very low BPM(not low note speed) and slowly raise it until I get it embedded into my muscle memory, and it really frustrates me that I'm not able to have the convenience of a training mode that could really facilitate more motivation and time spent playing the game. Even free games like OSU!Mania has the song map editor where you can actually slow down the BPM of a track to practice, I don't see why a paid game cant include this simple feature as well.

It's funny ya know, you would think an online only game like DJMAX would have more than just pretty colors/anime/weeb art to attract casual players like simply including an effective way to practice would be a good start to help bring more revenue, recognition, and a bigger playerbase to this already niche genre...

Maybe they should've thought about this instead of focusing on an useless ranked mode(that no one plays btw) and shoving xigncode3 down our throats...

Outside of this, it's a good game really, but I think the game has like no replay value at all if you aren't very good at rhythm games to begin with.

110,art of rally,Sports,550320,"Bought this game on a whim, just because how it looked and was not disappointed.
Now, I'm not really a racing fan having only played one or two older Need for Speed games - so I can't speak from the point of view of someone who knows a lot about racing games. And I won't.
Instead I'll review this from the point of view of someone who wanted a simple racing game to play once in a while. And I can say that I got what I wanted.

What I liked:
- looks really good. I like this type of minimalist low poly look and I think it works well with how minimalist the gameplay is
- simple gameplay. Pick a game mode, pick a car and drive. Nothing is distracting you from the actual core of the game - driving.
- realistic. Or what I imagine driving in real life is like. Every car feels different, every type of terrain feels different and it took me some time to learn how not to fly off the road on every turn. (Small tip: set transmission to manual in settings. Doing this gave me more control and made driving easier)
- music. I wouldn't listen to this OST on it's own, but it works really well with the game

What I think could've been better:
- my results info. When you finish a race you are given info like (5410 | 50%). Maybe it's just me but it's not clear what these numbers actually mean. I wish there was a tooltip or something with explanation for this
- map in free roam. When in free roam and looking for collectables I end up pressing Esc way too often and it breaks the immersion. I think it would be great if there was a setting to display a map in free roam mode.

To conclude, I think this game is great for someone who wants a pretty game to just drive and not be distracted by irrelevant tuning, carrer or other mechanics",550320

At this point let me say this game is not casual and not for everyone. You need that certain mindest to put yourself through it. But if you have that mindset and you like cars: do not hesitate. Just buy it. It's worth it.",550320

110,art of rally,Sports,550320,"A top down rally game like nothing else on the market at the moment. The graphics are very bright and colourful, the maps are well made and have plenty of variety in the straights,jumps,corners,camber,uphill and downhill sections. The game never gets boring plenty of content and cars to unlock in career mode.Plenty of other mode;s to mess around in too. Highly recommended game with hours and hours of game play.",550320
110,art of rally,Sports,550320,"Bought this game on a whim, just because how it looked and was not disappointed.
Now, I'm not really a racing fan having only played one or two older Need for Speed games - so I can't speak from the point of view of someone who knows a lot about racing games. And I won't.
Instead I'll review this from the point of view of someone who wanted a simple racing game to play once in a while. And I can say that I got what I wanted.

What I liked:
- looks really good. I like this type of minimalist low poly look and I think it works well with how minimalist the gameplay is
- simple gameplay. Pick a game mode, pick a car and drive. Nothing is distracting you from the actual core of the game - driving.
- realistic. Or what I imagine driving in real life is like. Every car feels different, every type of terrain feels different and it took me some time to learn how not to fly off the road on every turn. (Small tip: set transmission to manual in settings. Doing this gave me more control and made driving easier)
- music. I wouldn't listen to this OST on it's own, but it works really well with the game

What I think could've been better:
- my results info. When you finish a race you are given info like (5410 | 50%). Maybe it's just me but it's not clear what these numbers actually mean. I wish there was a tooltip or something with explanation for this
- map in free roam. When in free roam and looking for collectables I end up pressing Esc way too often and it breaks the immersion. I think it would be great if there was a setting to display a map in free roam mode.

To conclude, I think this game is great for someone who wants a pretty game to just drive and not be distracted by irrelevant tuning, carrer or other mechanics",550320
110,art of rally,Sports,550320,"Simple and relaxing driving game for everybody. Cheap, fun, replayable. Enough cars to satisfy every classic era rally car enjoyer.  What's not to like?",550320
110,art of rally,Sports,550320,"A top-down rally game that's both soothing and exciting. The soundtrack and visual style compliment each other well, not to mention the well made physics.",550320
110,art of rally,Sports,550320,"This Game is just a Loveletter to Car-Enthusiasts.

-It looks beautiful
-its really fun and authentic to drive
-most of the cars sound good.  i dont like some of them, but i also really love a few of them.
-the soundtrack is great

-the only bad thing i could say about art of rally is the highest difficulty. it could be a bit more punishing for my taste.
there are leaderboards though, if you really want to push yourself.

What really overwhelms me is the picturesque underwater fishing UI module that UF developed blowing my mind in excited anticipation as a big imposing fish slowly approaches -in -my-face to take my bait while playing on my PC.
What if the devs' incorporate dramatizations like movie film producers & directors do when presenting scenes like unexpected events occurring in the aquatic background while in the foreground you're doing your thing with your Console, Mobile or PC?

113,Dota 2,Strategy,570,"I've spent 10 years and almost 10,000 hours playing Warcraft III DotA as well as Dota 2, and loved playing it. I've met many interesting people, fought epic battles, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat through several Herculean efforts, endured many soul crushing defeats, and even clashed with a handful of professional players. The game has changed drastically over my many years of playing, but as of about a year ago, the game became too frustrating to continue, and as I continue to watch, I am saddened by what the game has become.

For years my friends and I have joked about the ""League-ification"" of Dota. Dota has always been the epitome of hyper competitive cooperative gameplay, with a high emphasis on individual skill and decision making at all phases of the game, especially in punishing poor decisions. Pushing a tower alone with nobody showing on the map? Get back or you're dead. Hard carry dies past 40 minutes without buyback? That's a barracks down. Pick crappy laning heroes? Welcome to hell while the enemy team runs a trilane and pushes barracks at 20 minutes.

Our jokes slowly but surely became a reality. Teleport scrolls were reduced in cost, meaning everybody rolled around with a handful because they weren't a financial burden. Ways to gain gold were increased, so supports could afford to have a handful of items in the mid game. The rubber band effect was introduced, and pushing strategies were neutered. You pick a lineup to take towers and take one unfavorable engagement and the game's over, whereas previously the greedier lineup would have to do more work than a single fight to overcome the gold advantage. The cost of boots was reduced, taking boots first strategies from a sure sign that you were bad to a viable strategy. Strong laners also got pushed out. Dominating the early game became effectively irrelevant as killing giant money bag heroes in the midgame would slingshot the trailing team into the lead.

The worst casualty has been the versatility of the game. Metas change and stuff goes in and out of favor, that's fine and fair, but certain aspects have become imperative to have. A support with a hard save, a hard carry that can fight in the early mid game. Bad laning heroes can just be sent mid, while traditional skill mid heroes are just sent to the safelane. When you take a big lead, the plan is almost always just farm out the map until you can't possibly lose when taking the high ground, as taking a risk will not just result in you losing a fight, but most likely the lead.

The game that I grew up with that punishes the smallest mistakes is a distant memory, and we are left with a mid game brawler. I wish Dota 2 the best as it progresses, but the core mechanics have been changed so drastically that I can neither play nor watch it without feeling like something that was once an unrelenting niche game has been formed to cater to the whims of the massive casual audience that it has attracted.",570

114,Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,"also ik that this is so long it might as well be a book. im just using one of my past expieriences to give you an idea how the average civ game works. no game of civilization is ever the same!

-picks chieftan (cuz I'm bad at the game)
-picks america
-spawns as the only civilization on the continent (although I'd say island would be a better term)
-after colonizing the entire island and taking advantage of all the resources i research sailing so i dont have to be so isolated.
-I meet the Siamese
-I meet the Ottomans
-I meet the Russians
-I decide to take advantage of the new found resources and start a settlement.
-The city of Choccolocco is founded!
-i decide to go for a scientific victory
-The Siamese asked if they could be friends. Of course i accepted
-a few turns later and Russia wanted to be friends. i accepted. little did I know I would regret making friends with both these people....
-The Siamese asked if I wanted to go to war with the Ottomans. i said ""ten turns. give me ten turns then we'll talk.""
-in these ten turns i assembled every nearby military unit in the area and created a military of...2 swordsman. (the production in choccolocco was low at the time, mind you. it was a new settlement.)
-The time for war has come. i moved my 2 swordsmen straight to the one and only city of Istanbul. I attacked them...and they took out one of my men and the other one retreated.
-help
-i waited for the siamese to arrive, but they didnt come. for a second i thought that the siamese may abandon me.
-but then, when things were at there worst, the siamese came.
-and oh did they come. siamese armies came from all sides!
-but even that wasnt enough.
-thankfully the army kept the enemy busy while i built a navy and got them to the ottoman capital.
-it was fairly obvious that the siamese army wasnt enough to defeat the capital and the...ONE ARCHER. the capital and that one archer was fending off multiple armies.
-but it didnt matter. by the time the last of the siamese armies began to retreat, i had researched mathmatics and had a catapult! combine that with my navy, and I had totally won.
-my swordsman dealt the finishing blow and Istanbul was now an american city.
-the Siamese thanked me for helping them eliminate the ottomans.
-decided to focus on building up my already flourishing economy.
-then, out of nowhere, Russia declared war on the Siamese!
-at the time i was friends with both.
-both of them expected me to take there side in the war. 
-if i didnt take any side in the war, both of them will denounce me for not helping them when at war.
-if i choose a side the other will hate me and others will denounce me for betraying a friend.
-help
-i sent a scout to explore and they found a new continent AND the aztecs
-after getting an open borders agreement with the aztecs the scout explored the land and discovered that the aztecs pretty much owned the entire continent
-so colonizing that continent without going to war is outta the question....
-I found out that the aztecs dont ENTIRELY own the land. Egypt owns a single city. 
-egypt also denounced me and called me a warmongering menace because i helped a friend in need.
-well hello to you too.
-I pay Russia to make peace with the Siamese
-Me and siamese make a defensive pact
-both sides get mad at me for not helping in the war
-they still seem pretty friendly towards me tho
-Russia declares war on the Siamese
-this time i dont really have a choice but to declare war on Russia...
-luckily the city with most of the military is right near a russian city
-i attack the city
-i do most of the work
-at the end the siamese swooped in and stole the city
-WHAT THE HECK RAMKHAMHAENG?!
-i decided that it was only fair that he got the city after i got the other city in the last war we had
-since most of the units i had was killed, and i wanted to focus on my economy, i made peace with russia and eventually convinced her to make peace with the siamese
-i decided not to go into any more defensive pacts since the siamese and russia couldnt get along and this clearly wouldnt be the last war they'd have
-I also got a great scientist and decided to save him for the end
-the aztecs declare war upon egypt
-i feel sorry for egypt
-i ask russia and siam if they wanna help
-they say yes
-we go straight to the capital
-then I realize that the aztecs have plenty of time to get units to the shore while we sail across the ocean
-they decimate our armies before they even get close to the capital
-he sends all his units and attacks our continent
-he destroys egypt
-he attacks everyone
-russia makes peace and then declares war on me
-siam does too
-WHAT THE HECK RUSSIA AND SIAM?!?!
-though my units were more advanced, they were outnumbered my units
-they take istanbul
-they take choccolocco
-they sail to my continent and takes all cities except for washington
-i prepared for this and had an army ready
-i begged for peace but they refused
-i offered my smaller island bound cities
-they declined
-the city of washington, on 1842 AD, was taken by siam, who was once my strongest ally and friend.

-America has fallen

114,Sid Meier's Civilization® V,Strategy,8930,"also ik that this is so long it might as well be a book. im just using one of my past expieriences to give you an idea how the average civ game works. no game of civilization is ever the same!

-picks chieftan (cuz I'm bad at the game)
-picks america
-spawns as the only civilization on the continent (although I'd say island would be a better term)
-after colonizing the entire island and taking advantage of all the resources i research sailing so i dont have to be so isolated.
-I meet the Siamese
-I meet the Ottomans
-I meet the Russians
-I decide to take advantage of the new found resources and start a settlement.
-The city of Choccolocco is founded!
-i decide to go for a scientific victory
-The Siamese asked if they could be friends. Of course i accepted
-a few turns later and Russia wanted to be friends. i accepted. little did I know I would regret making friends with both these people....
-The Siamese asked if I wanted to go to war with the Ottomans. i said ""ten turns. give me ten turns then we'll talk.""
-in these ten turns i assembled every nearby military unit in the area and created a military of...2 swordsman. (the production in choccolocco was low at the time, mind you. it was a new settlement.)
-The time for war has come. i moved my 2 swordsmen straight to the one and only city of Istanbul. I attacked them...and they took out one of my men and the other one retreated.
-help
-i waited for the siamese to arrive, but they didnt come. for a second i thought that the siamese may abandon me.
-but then, when things were at there worst, the siamese came.
-and oh did they come. siamese armies came from all sides!
-but even that wasnt enough.
-thankfully the army kept the enemy busy while i built a navy and got them to the ottoman capital.
-it was fairly obvious that the siamese army wasnt enough to defeat the capital and the...ONE ARCHER. the capital and that one archer was fending off multiple armies.
-but it didnt matter. by the time the last of the siamese armies began to retreat, i had researched mathmatics and had a catapult! combine that with my navy, and I had totally won.
-my swordsman dealt the finishing blow and Istanbul was now an american city.
-the Siamese thanked me for helping them eliminate the ottomans.
-decided to focus on building up my already flourishing economy.
-then, out of nowhere, Russia declared war on the Siamese!
-at the time i was friends with both.
-both of them expected me to take there side in the war. 
-if i didnt take any side in the war, both of them will denounce me for not helping them when at war.
-if i choose a side the other will hate me and others will denounce me for betraying a friend.
-help
-i sent a scout to explore and they found a new continent AND the aztecs
-after getting an open borders agreement with the aztecs the scout explored the land and discovered that the aztecs pretty much owned the entire continent
-so colonizing that continent without going to war is outta the question....
-I found out that the aztecs dont ENTIRELY own the land. Egypt owns a single city. 
-egypt also denounced me and called me a warmongering menace because i helped a friend in need.
-well hello to you too.
-I pay Russia to make peace with the Siamese
-Me and siamese make a defensive pact
-both sides get mad at me for not helping in the war
-they still seem pretty friendly towards me tho
-Russia declares war on the Siamese
-this time i dont really have a choice but to declare war on Russia...
-luckily the city with most of the military is right near a russian city
-i attack the city
-i do most of the work
-at the end the siamese swooped in and stole the city
-WHAT THE HECK RAMKHAMHAENG?!
-i decided that it was only fair that he got the city after i got the other city in the last war we had
-since most of the units i had was killed, and i wanted to focus on my economy, i made peace with russia and eventually convinced her to make peace with the siamese
-i decided not to go into any more defensive pacts since the siamese and russia couldnt get along and this clearly wouldnt be the last war they'd have
-I also got a great scientist and decided to save him for the end
-the aztecs declare war upon egypt
-i feel sorry for egypt
-i ask russia and siam if they wanna help
-they say yes
-we go straight to the capital
-then I realize that the aztecs have plenty of time to get units to the shore while we sail across the ocean
-they decimate our armies before they even get close to the capital
-he sends all his units and attacks our continent
-he destroys egypt
-he attacks everyone
-russia makes peace and then declares war on me
-siam does too
-WHAT THE HECK RUSSIA AND SIAM?!?!
-though my units were more advanced, they were outnumbered my units
-they take istanbul
-they take choccolocco
-they sail to my continent and takes all cities except for washington
-i prepared for this and had an army ready
-i begged for peace but they refused
-i offered my smaller island bound cities
-they declined
-the city of washington, on 1842 AD, was taken by siam, who was once my strongest ally and friend.

-America has fallen

so in conclusion...its a pretty good game.",8930

Bloons TD 6 is [i]the[/i] mick jagger of tower defense game. A little bit wacky, fun, unique style and definitely a jewel for TD gamers. 

[h1]Non-TLDR[/h1]
Bloons TD 6 (BTD 6), developed and published by Ninja Kiwi. The PC version was relased on Dec 17, 2018 and it is also available on the Iphone/Ipad. On Metacritic (https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bloons-td-6) it has:
[list]
    [*]0 Metascore from critic reviews
    [*]An average user score of 7.4 from 30 ratings
[/list]

If you've played Flash games before, you'd probably come across bloon td. if you are someone who loves tower defense games, you'd probably slay a ton of bloons before ninja kiwi (and other flash game developers) migrated to steam because Flash is no longer supported by Adobe. So these group of people have seen how bloon td evolved till today. 

As for the younger generations, this may seem like some wild, crazy, mess up monkey revenge business against balloons. Did i mention that it was also fun/can be frustrating at the same time?

[h1]Overview[/h1]
BTD 6 offers players 40 over maps to play. it comes in 3 difficulty and each difficulty has different set of challenges - that will test your skill and knowledge. For some odd reasons, BTD 6 has a complicated map system for online/co-op game play. 

[list]
    [*]You can't play online or co-op under the [u]standard[/u] ""play"" game. 
    [*]Daily challenges are strictly solo.
    [*]Co-op challenges can be played with friends/others over the internet.
    [*]Co-op can only be played in co-op maps.
    [*]There are 2 variations of co-op maps:
[olist]
    [*]Play the entire map
    [*]Play in 1 of the sections of the map
[/olist]
    [*]Other events/Challenges are strictly solo.
[/list]

Your towers have it's own leveling system. Aside from that, the more you play, you also gain up exp for your own account - this is the monkey knowledge system. As you level up, you gain monkey knowledge points which can be used to purchase ""perks"" for your towers or heroes tower. Yes, there are heroes tower which needs to be unlocked & purchased (not microtrans). If i am not mistaken, the first 2 heroes can be unlocked and given to you after you reach certain levels.

Other than all of the above, you now have:
[list]
    [*]Powers = non-towers that can be placed on to the map to assist you in various ways.
    [*]Insta towers = free towers that you have acquire through challenges/events. These towers come with certain upgrades already.
[/list]

On top of all of this, it has a trophy store, where you can purchase various in-game elements; visuals/ui/emoticons. Nothing that can affect the gameplay. You earn trophy from odyssey game mode. finally, it has a microtransaction shop.

BTD 6 isn't just your standard Tower Defense game with all this features.

[h1]Controls, Audio, Visuals[/h1]
Visuals: It's 3d'ish looking. colorful, clean. certain maps have objects to interact/block your line of sight. Monkeys and bloons have been properly designed. no complains. +1 to the team

Audio: Energetic vibe. I believe you can purchase additional soundtrack from the trophy store. (yet to try). There's a jukebox to enable. +1 to the team

Controls: Mouse. For more advanced/hardcore gamers, you can use keyboard keys.

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]
As a tower defense game, your goal is to prevent the bloons from exiting the map. If it does, your life will be deducted. Once you lose all of your life, the game ends. At this point, you can either replay from scratch or use monkey cash to re-try again. 

What makes BTD 6 complicated is the difficulty and what game mode you are playing on. A standard easy vs Deflation easy is 2 totally different game mode while they share the ""common"" easy rules. Same concept applies to the other difficulty/harder maps. 

On the surface it may seem like all the maps and bloons are the same. So, what exactly makes the game ""harder""?
The first criteria is the game mode which you are playing. It will set the tone on how hard/what sort of challenge you will be presented. (1 hp game, magicians tower only, reverse path, half cash etc)

The second criteria is the difficulty levels. On a general note, the higher difficulty you play, you will be required to play more levels. easy: 40 levels. medium 60. hard 80. you will encounter much harder bloon types (mix and match from various properties: camo, ceramic, metal, rainbow, regrow, FORTIFIED! etc). The bloon type is what dictates ""how hard the game"" will be. 

In order to beat hard maps, you will definitely need to max out your tower levels and invest into monkey knowledge. Heroes are not prominent until you start to play on hard maps or you have a particular way of playing/sync it with other towers.

The tower themselves are unique and depending on your style of play, you can mix and match certain tower styles. In this sense it gives flexibility to the players - some may opt of the ninja tower but others prefer the sniper. 

[h1]My personal thoughts/My Summary[/h1]
Bloon TD has come a long way. I wouldn't say BTD 6 has revolutionize tower defense games but it's certainly not your average tower defense. What makes it fun/challenging is the bloons. Knowing your enemy properties and spawn at which level will greatly increase the gameplay experience else its going to be bonkers.

40 over maps playing solo can feel repetitive and boring. On harder maps, where you are required to play 80 levels or more (more time spent) can be a turn off after xxx hours.

Going co-op, you will have to stick with the map layout and without a proper way to communicate, can turn the game into a messy monkey business. Spamming of emoticons that doesnt make sense. I dont voice chat unless i am playing with my friends. in other words, playing online with public you have to bare with the: 1) map layout (free for all or play in a section of the map), 2) communication limitation 3) knowledge of the person..and style of play
can lead to a [b][u]painful[/u][/b] experience. 

ever played in a co-op map where one of the player just build 1 tower in a hard game map? 
or leaves immediately once the game starts?
or mass tower hugging at the entrance? [b]vomits blood[/b]

On the other hand, if you are playing with knowledgeable people, you learn and have more fun. I wished there was a way to add them into your friend list. I would love to have more co-op maps that are free to play style than sections though.

So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Bloon TD 6 is a no-monkey business, creative coconut mess that is fun. An easy 8/10.",960090

115,Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"I want to start off this review by noting that I seldom played previous Bloons games apart from Bloons TD Battles. Due to this, as you can imagine, it was a little difficult to adapt to the games style in comparison to Battles, especially with the addition of heroes. However, this game has far surpassed all my expectations when I first purchased the game for only 99 cents. Despite thew extremely low cost, I have gotten an unprecedented amount of enjoyable gameplay, even in comparison to games that cost 20x as much. The gameplay is energetic, vibrant, and increasingly challenging in an incredibly fun way. The different monkeys all seem to be relatively balanced and the addition of three upgrade paths allows for an absurd amount of different unique play styles and setups. Every monkey has its own situational use you have to play the game to get more and more used to the different monkeys. The heroes mesh nicely with the game and the ranging difficulty of the maps allows for players to progress in skill at their own pace. On top of this, there are lots of cool community events and the game is even more of a blast when you play with friends. I would most certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and chill strategy game to play with your friends or solo.",960090

115,Bloons TD 6,Strategy,960090,"I want to start off this review by noting that I seldom played previous Bloons games apart from Bloons TD Battles. Due to this, as you can imagine, it was a little difficult to adapt to the games style in comparison to Battles, especially with the addition of heroes. However, this game has far surpassed all my expectations when I first purchased the game for only 99 cents. Despite thew extremely low cost, I have gotten an unprecedented amount of enjoyable gameplay, even in comparison to games that cost 20x as much. The gameplay is energetic, vibrant, and increasingly challenging in an incredibly fun way. The different monkeys all seem to be relatively balanced and the addition of three upgrade paths allows for an absurd amount of different unique play styles and setups. Every monkey has its own situational use you have to play the game to get more and more used to the different monkeys. The heroes mesh nicely with the game and the ranging difficulty of the maps allows for players to progress in skill at their own pace. On top of this, there are lots of cool community events and the game is even more of a blast when you play with friends. I would most certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and chill strategy game to play with your friends or solo.",960090

Great game, addicting as hell and the fact that I got over 1000+ hours in the game in under a year should point to that. Mods just add more to the game and most of them are great and some are must haves. 11/10 would buy again.

What follows are semi coherent ramblings about the game, read at your own peril.

[spoiler]

Rimworld is infinitely replayable. You start with several scenarios that give you a varying amount of ""pawns"" (your slaves to do with you want), techlevels and resources. You can generate planets and modify said generation making planets tropical paradises, hellish deserts or frozen wastelands. When you get tired of the basic scenarios you can also make your own. Want your pawn(s) to start a drug addict and fight for survival while going through withdrawal? You can do that. Want your pawn(s) to be bionic super soldiers hell bent on destroying the planet.... that is possible too. You can play as wanderers or colonists or a mixture of both styles. And with the dev tools available ingame you can easily modify the game while you play it, putting even more chaos into the mix. You can do everything from spawning new pawns, animals and so on, to changing the weather, to making the map a peaceful paradise...... (sorry, the warcriminal in me cringed a bit).

Obviously you can play on peaceful and turn it into a game of building and designing colonies or to exploring the world. Or you can play on the highest difficulty with ironman enabled to challenge your skill, your nerves and most importantly: your luck. Here once again Rimworlds easy customizability comes into play, permitting you to tailor the difficulty to your prefered playstyle, even mid game. And once you get tired (not that that is possible) of the game, you can istall mods to change everything or very little. New species, more animals, better interfaces (RimHud be praised), new weapons, rebalances for practically everything in the game and mods that totally change the game or the setting.
Rimworld as I now understand it, is about making a story, about leading your pawns as good as you can so they might survive another day (or torturing them into insanity, turning them into drug addicts and cold blooded murders or harvesting their organs one by one). As one of the tooltips of the game says ""A destroyed colony is not a failure, it is a tradegy"" (didnt look it up so it probably isnt 100% accurate).

As you play all pawns (on the map) interact socially and build relationships and connections. Those relationships then influence their interactions and what they think of the others. These interactions as other interactions with the world influence their happiness (mood) which can, when it falls below a certain threshold, lead to mental breaks. These mental breaks are varied and can go from aimless wandering to muderous rage where the pawn wont stop until their target is dead or the are killed (or arrested). 


I wont go into the carfting, building or research but suffice to say there are many options to pick from, many choices to be made when crafting or building and plenty of research to be researched.

All these interactions give flavor to the the world and it inhabitants. It can happen that a family member of one of your pawns comes and visits you, peacefully or with the intention of destroying everything you have. Out of these interactions a story is crafted. (A certain mod makes these interactions more visible by giving your pawns speachbubbles so you can easily read how they interact.)
After I figured this out I stopped building absurd over the top bases and instead focused more on my pawns and fullfilling their needs and seeing how they interact. Back then I tended to have my speed at x3 so stuff got built faster, which lead to me missing practically all interactions and only being able to see the consequences. I now play on x1 most of the time and watch them go about their work, chatting, flirting or insulting the pawns they pass or share work space with. It is far more engaging then playing it as a rts or something similiar.

And the Royalty DLC adds many new things and several new playstyles
So yeah, worth every cent. This game gave me the best money to time spent ratio of all my games
Randy Random/10 would play again

117,RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Alright, I took my time and I think I finally have a good grasp on my thoughts about this game. I'll try to keep them short and to-the-point.

This is one of those games I've spent quite a bit more hours in than I'd like to admit. Not because the game is bad or embarrassing or anything -- it's because I feel a little bit weird about having so many games collecting dust in my library and then never ""finding the time or energy"" to even boot them, but then I have titles like rimworld that I've somehow found that ""time and energy"" in abundance.

On the surface the game seems either casual or overly complex, depending on which stage of playing it you are currently in. Before buying this game, it seemed casual (likely attributed to the art style) and after I finally clocked my first hour in, I had to admit it seemed a bit too complex for a simple man like me.

This is, however, just a charade. The game is neither casual nor overly complex. The game is very nicely balanced in its complexity and the generally great (although not very aesthetically pleasing) GUI plays a big part in that. 

Now, my experience has been enhanced by mods from the very beginning. My very first (short-lived) playthrough was entirely vanilla, but as with most games, I quickly checked out the mods and just couldn't stop myself.

The best part of this game is the modding community and all the awesome mods that we've had the pleasure to play with and experience. And I'm not even exaggerating that. It's absolutely amazing how much variety and even very specific little things we have. And there's no lack of absolutely gigantic mods with entirely new, complex and well-balanced mechanics. This is one of those games that actually benefit greatly from mods, and it has been developed in a way to make this possible. This is a very mod-friendly title and that is always a complete treat.

Once you get a grasp on the mechanics and what the game is about, it's an endless hole to throw your time in. It's even worse than civ in this regard, even if civ has the iconic ""one more turn"" phrase attached to it. And I shouldn't use the word ""worse"" -- it is indeed better for it.

I've never managed to get anywhere close to building the ship that seems to be the ultimate goal for this game. But I've never even cared for ending the game honestly. All of my games, except for the first two more serious attempts, have been tribal starts with mods that make it a true ""start from the ancient times and slowly build up"" experience. I love the game in this form -- you start with barely enough technology to survive the first winter, and even if it is technically enough, it often turns out to be tricky to manage. The technologies advance so slow it plays no big part in this first huge problem/puzzle, though I'm not sure if I've always just had some mod that makes that harder than vanilla. But the point is -- I've never, to this day, gotten very far in the technology tree in a true tribal/""ancient"" start. And I've never felt like I've been missing out or bored waiting for the technology to advance. It's exactly to the contrary.

The thing is, and this is the downside for me, the game is so gripping and slow in pace (which is an amazing thing) that every time I try to commit to a playthrough and actually get somewhere, something else in my life happens and I can't touch the game for months. Coming back after that, there's always either the fact that some mods no longer work either together or with the base game, or I've completely forgot the entire story I had been building and no longer felt any connection to the save even if it did work after all that time. So I've always just started again and again and again.

And never have I been able to get very far.

Which is absolutely okay, for me anyway. The most fulfilling part of the game in my opinion is the beginning. You get to know the characters, their quirks, you carefully fine-tune the work priorities, the daily schedules, select a spot for the colony and just start living it, slowly building atop each small achievement or milestone. It's a very intriguing combination of planning, building, honing and expanding on all of those iteratively, decision after decision.

And it's just a very gripping, fulfilling experience. More so than most games that I can think of.

This is a game that doesn't look like much, if you're used to triple-A level of graphics and UI. But the game itself is full of soul, full of possibilities and full of moments that'll make you feel something.

It's a game I would whole-heartedly suggest everyone sees for themselves. This might just be a game-changer for you too. Even if it isn't, I doubt you'll feel cheated of your time after you try it out. I'd even go as far as bet that you'll absolutely love it even if it doesn't stick.",294100

Rimworld as I now understand it, is about making a story, about leading your pawns as good as you can so they might survive another day (or torturing them into insanity, turning them into drug addicts and cold blooded murders or harvesting their organs one by one). As one of the tooltips of the game says ""A destroyed colony is not a failure, it is a tradegy"" (didnt look it up so it probably isnt 100% accurate).

As you play all pawns (on the map) interact socially and build relationships and connections. Those relationships then influence their interactions and what they think of the others. These interactions as other interactions with the world influence their happiness (mood) which can, when it falls below a certain threshold, lead to mental breaks. These mental breaks are varied and can go from aimless wandering to muderous rage where the pawn wont stop until their target is dead or the are killed (or arrested). 


I wont go into the carfting, building or research but suffice to say there are many options to pick from, many choices to be made when crafting or building and plenty of research to be researched.

All these interactions give flavor to the the world and it inhabitants. It can happen that a family member of one of your pawns comes and visits you, peacefully or with the intention of destroying everything you have. Out of these interactions a story is crafted. (A certain mod makes these interactions more visible by giving your pawns speachbubbles so you can easily read how they interact.)
After I figured this out I stopped building absurd over the top bases and instead focused more on my pawns and fullfilling their needs and seeing how they interact. Back then I tended to have my speed at x3 so stuff got built faster, which lead to me missing practically all interactions and only being able to see the consequences. I now play on x1 most of the time and watch them go about their work, chatting, flirting or insulting the pawns they pass or share work space with. It is far more engaging then playing it as a rts or something similiar.

And the Royalty DLC adds many new things and several new playstyles
So yeah, worth every cent. This game gave me the best money to time spent ratio of all my games

117,RimWorld,Strategy,294100,"Alright, I took my time and I think I finally have a good grasp on my thoughts about this game. I'll try to keep them short and to-the-point.

This is one of those games I've spent quite a bit more hours in than I'd like to admit. Not because the game is bad or embarrassing or anything -- it's because I feel a little bit weird about having so many games collecting dust in my library and then never ""finding the time or energy"" to even boot them, but then I have titles like rimworld that I've somehow found that ""time and energy"" in abundance.

On the surface the game seems either casual or overly complex, depending on which stage of playing it you are currently in. Before buying this game, it seemed casual (likely attributed to the art style) and after I finally clocked my first hour in, I had to admit it seemed a bit too complex for a simple man like me.

This is, however, just a charade. The game is neither casual nor overly complex. The game is very nicely balanced in its complexity and the generally great (although not very aesthetically pleasing) GUI plays a big part in that. 

Now, my experience has been enhanced by mods from the very beginning. My very first (short-lived) playthrough was entirely vanilla, but as with most games, I quickly checked out the mods and just couldn't stop myself.

The best part of this game is the modding community and all the awesome mods that we've had the pleasure to play with and experience. And I'm not even exaggerating that. It's absolutely amazing how much variety and even very specific little things we have. And there's no lack of absolutely gigantic mods with entirely new, complex and well-balanced mechanics. This is one of those games that actually benefit greatly from mods, and it has been developed in a way to make this possible. This is a very mod-friendly title and that is always a complete treat.

Once you get a grasp on the mechanics and what the game is about, it's an endless hole to throw your time in. It's even worse than civ in this regard, even if civ has the iconic ""one more turn"" phrase attached to it. And I shouldn't use the word ""worse"" -- it is indeed better for it.

I've never managed to get anywhere close to building the ship that seems to be the ultimate goal for this game. But I've never even cared for ending the game honestly. All of my games, except for the first two more serious attempts, have been tribal starts with mods that make it a true ""start from the ancient times and slowly build up"" experience. I love the game in this form -- you start with barely enough technology to survive the first winter, and even if it is technically enough, it often turns out to be tricky to manage. The technologies advance so slow it plays no big part in this first huge problem/puzzle, though I'm not sure if I've always just had some mod that makes that harder than vanilla. But the point is -- I've never, to this day, gotten very far in the technology tree in a true tribal/""ancient"" start. And I've never felt like I've been missing out or bored waiting for the technology to advance. It's exactly to the contrary.

The thing is, and this is the downside for me, the game is so gripping and slow in pace (which is an amazing thing) that every time I try to commit to a playthrough and actually get somewhere, something else in my life happens and I can't touch the game for months. Coming back after that, there's always either the fact that some mods no longer work either together or with the base game, or I've completely forgot the entire story I had been building and no longer felt any connection to the save even if it did work after all that time. So I've always just started again and again and again.

And never have I been able to get very far.

Which is absolutely okay, for me anyway. The most fulfilling part of the game in my opinion is the beginning. You get to know the characters, their quirks, you carefully fine-tune the work priorities, the daily schedules, select a spot for the colony and just start living it, slowly building atop each small achievement or milestone. It's a very intriguing combination of planning, building, honing and expanding on all of those iteratively, decision after decision.

And it's just a very gripping, fulfilling experience. More so than most games that I can think of.

This is a game that doesn't look like much, if you're used to triple-A level of graphics and UI. But the game itself is full of soul, full of possibilities and full of moments that'll make you feel something.

It's a game I would whole-heartedly suggest everyone sees for themselves. This might just be a game-changer for you too. Even if it isn't, I doubt you'll feel cheated of your time after you try it out. I'd even go as far as bet that you'll absolutely love it even if it doesn't stick.",294100

The same base civ concepts are great because they are just the same thing from Civ 5. I find this game to be more tedious and more boring, I felt like there was too much unnecessary additions and goals added to the game. On top of that, just doing the bare minimum essentials to try and succeed in the standard game is a chore every few turns. I like being nervous every once and a while in Civ wether its barbarians or an actual war on my hands but I do not enjoy the amount of stress that you have to manage in this game.

119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"i have played CIV for almost 30 years, 

I have not played Civilisation 6 very long, having bought the game on steam, I miss having the physical charts and manuals, but I have been learning as I play, the game is slightly different from Civilisation 5, but vastly different from Civ IV

I had found  Civ V to have many faults and it would crash a lot.  I have problems on this version if I try and play on directx 12, but there is the choice of 11 or 12.  

I think from the original civilisation game, 1 to 4 is a progression of the original and the game is being improved, 5 and 6 is basically Civ back to the start and a complete rewrite.
What I did not like about the original CIv was there was a limit to the total number of units the game could manage, but upto that point the game was brilliant, but Civ 2 came a long and the game got bigger.

I think in terms of playing Civ I was happy on Civ III and Civ IV.  It might be that I was able to understand the interface of the game from 2 to 4 and just start playing knowing the game has slightly changed.

the main problem with Civ 6 is that the previous Civ games need updating and there isn't much improvement really needed, If I was going to choose a Civilisation game to play it would be Civ 4",289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Personally, I like CIV 6. Objectively speaking, it would be hard to recommend this game.

The CIV series was always one of my favorite strategy games. Building up your civilization from one tiny city to a world-spanning empire was and will always be fun.

Let's get the big negative out of the way. The 2K Launcher.
Which got inspired by the 4X genre. Explore, expand, exploit, exterminate.
2K explored new ways to annoy players. They expanded by introducing a new client. They exploit their player base by forcing this wreck on us. Finally, they exterminated any fun and positive reviews with it.

With that out of the way, let's get to a more detailed review.

CIV 6's aesthetics are a nice breath of fresh air and fit the game very well. Some people might prefer more realistic-looking graphics but I really like the new look.
The soundtrack is pretty solid as always, nothing to complain about there.
Sean Bean as the narrator did an amazing job, although the quotes are a bit weird sometimes. Definitely could have picked better ones for some techs, wonders and civics.

Now for the most important part, the gameplay.
CIV 6 is more casual than other titles. Every civ has its specific strengths that make them more suitable for certain builds. But you can play them pretty much however you want, at least in singleplayer. It is not a challenging or complex game and most difficulties will stem from RNG than anything else. You at least need the Rise & Fall and Gathering storm expansions, vanilla CIV 6 is way too barebone and offers little to no variety in gameplay.
Whenever I finish a singleplayer session with a civ, I always have to take a break, simply because it gets boring and repetitive after some time. You start to dominate the map way too soon and there is not a lot going on, even on higher difficulties. Emperor is probably the sweet spot for fun, Immortal and Deity can be very annoying sometimes.",289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I enjoyed this game while I could play it, but the new launcher broke it beyond playability and it crashes sometimes just sitting for a few minutes at the main menu. Wish Firaxis would fix the problems.",289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"My favorite game series since I was a kid on Civilization II but what did they do to this poor game? It seems like a recent update crashes the game and they never fixed the world builder (i.e. you can't use start locations). New features are steering away from realism. A history game with Zombies? That doesn't sit right with me. I would love to see more historical scenarios but firaxis isn't expanding on them anymore. 

From the start, Civilization VI felt outbalanced. District adjacencies will cause a player to massively outpace others. It isn't normal that I find myself with aircrafts and my buddies with swordsmen despite playing on different difficulty levels. The art is terrible with this mobile game feel to it but at least there are mods for that.

I'm waiting for a Civilization VII and I'm hoping they correct course and go back to what I loved about this game. Otherwise, I think I'll stick with their competitors like Paradox (Crusader Kings, Hearts of Iron) or Amplitude (Endless legends, Humankind).",289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Do not recommend this game until the 2K launcher is removed and the game can launch through Steam again. I've managed to get the game to work 1/2 the time by launching directly from the Steam Files' .exe rather than using Steam, but that's just. Honestly absurd for a game that worked fine without a separate launcher. I shouldn't have to troubleshoot for 10-15 minutes to get a Steam game to run.",289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I got a notification that Civilization 6 will collect my data and ship it to other countries that may not have the same level of privacy collection.

I uninstalled the game right then and there, too bad I can't get a refund.",289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Was the game great ? I may never know.  Is 2K  the Problem or just the hours that it will take to fix this Joke of a update. Until they fix it I would suggest A Thumbs Down Review. Remember Steam is stuck just like we are so leave a thumbs down at 2K and firaxis . They are the cause of this.,289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I've been playing this game from the very beginning. Its had some downs in the past with certain bugs/balance changes and sometimes the DLC model is a bit pricey, but all in all it was a fun experience. Until the most recent update completely broke the game. 

The final game update has been causing all sorts of problems for players across the board, from crashing and performance issues to broken maps and content: True Start Location (TSL) are busted for many players, some game mode combinations cause the game to crash during loading, map generation can get stuck in a infinite loop, and some people can't even get into the game at all.

It hurts to ""not recommend"" Civ 6 after getting so much enjoyment out of it, but in its current state I can't.

119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"[h1] From Hero to Zero, how far this franchise has fallen [/h1]

I have sat on writing this review for so long because of how much I have adored the Civilization franchise over the years, and how many wonderful hours I have spent preventing Ghandi's nuking philosophy in Civ 3,  fearing Montezuma's Jaguar rush in Civ 4, and holding the line on Diety difficulty with Haile Selasse in Civ 5. My only known quotient of time spent would be 2,000+ hrs on Civ 5.

It pains me to have to give a negative review for Civilization 6, even after I have given so much time for them to improve the game to a quality standard - far longer then it took with expansions from previous iterations. There are a few things I find enjoyable as a base: the graphic style, the district system, and the AI (although not close to perfect) is a step forward from previous iterations - especially from a tactical stand point. Instead of building off what are some promising systems, the publisher and developer continue to push this product towards a flaming pile of garbage. Here are my general opinions on the current state of this game.

[u] Too much depth, not enough substance [/u] 

Firaxis (and likely directed by 2K Games) have chosen to move towards fluff instead of fibre. From the first instalment of Civilization 6, there has been fundamental flaws with the economic system like no other previous version has had. Production is broken - period. There is no other resource in this game that will guarantee you victories like stacking production into oblivion. Gold is far too inflated right from the start of a match, meaning that by mid game you are seeing costs that are so unnecessarily high that you need an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of purchasing goals. Faith is a rollercoaster - some Ages it is worthless, and other Ages it is overpowering. What was an interesting transition in Civ 5 to bring in tourism, has completely forced culture generation in Civ 6 to be limited in value; additionally, the great work and great person system is far less enjoyable as it's functionally has been complicated and reduced (respectively). These are the [b] base [/b] resources for the game, and since the OG version, Firaxis has only doubled down on inflating the complexity by adding [b] far more [/b] resources to counter balance, instead of attempting to resolve their broken economics. A shame really, as previous iterations of Civ worked on resolving their flaws with each expansion.

[u] The Frontier F-up [/u]

Well, what hasn't been said on any other game with predatory DLC practices. This sits there right up with another known developer that sounds like a ""pair of ducks"". After completing 3 expansions, and having all the flaws as said above, Firaxis pushed a non-requested DLC package on to players with [i] new features [/i] that would [i] improve the game [/i]. At the same time, a game breaking exploit that was well known for years by players and was repeatedly advised to Firaxis was ignored. As such, when the DLC was released and the company was (deservedly) given poor reviews on the state of the product, they finally fixed this exploit. Additionally, the content provided took away from the existing systems and created new ones. The civs and leaders added were far more powerful then what was existing in the game. Then to rub salt in the wound, Firaxis would seemingly do something that has truly pushed me to this bad review.

[u] Multiplayer is [b] unplayable [/b] [/u]

This catastrophe finally did it for me. I've never really been huge into multiplayer to be fair. Most of my hours spent over the years has been in solo play. But when I have played with friends, it has been some of the most competitive, humorous, and yet relaxing game play I have experience. The Frontier Pass, and whatever changes it made in the game, has now made the multiplayer so laggy I feel like I'm back playing OG Starcraft on dial up. It is completely unacceptable to have the end of my turn not complete until other players have nearly finished their turn, due to the lag. What the hell Firaxis?!? Are they seriously unaware as to how much this coding mess has created with all these brand new ""bells and whistles"" fluff like secret societies, industries, and random meteor showers? If they are aware, it sure is silence on their part. But of course, new events and influencer videos should fix my frustrations with it, right? (pardon the salty sarcasm)

[b] Lesson learned - if it's broke, just don't buy it [/b]

To wrap this up, I am now dissuaded from playing the product I bought, encouraged to play the previous version of Civilization, and resolved to not purchase anything further from Firaxis until they have demonstrated that a quality product can be made. It is unfortunate, as it is likely the publisher (2K, I'm still calling you out too) forcing these decisions to be made in the way they are. 

If you care about quality, buy Civilization 5, or Civilization 4 even. Both are gems of their time, hopefully not to be lost forever due to another money grab.",289070

119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Just play Civ 5. It is a much better game imo. Simple, fun, easy to get into but can be mastered with practice. This game has nothing going for it. The art style of the game is too cartoonish, the gameplay has a lot of content but little to no depth in most of the choices you make. The same base civ concepts are great because they are just the same thing from Civ 5. I find this game to be more tedious and more boring, I felt like there was too much unnecessary additions and goals added to the game. On top of that, just doing the bare minimum essentials to try and succeed in the standard game is a chore every few turns. I like being nervous every once and a while in Civ wether its barbarians or an actual war on my hands but I do not enjoy the amount of stress that you have to manage in this game. Like I said in the beginning of this review, If you have not played any Civ games and are considering this one to be your first, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS. BUY CIVILIZATION 5",289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"The game itsself is good, but my god they absolutely ruined it with their awful awful launcher.

They are also no help saying its a known issue and have to just try to uninstall and reinstall and lose my stuff. So no help there and no longer purchasing through steam since they have become a pointless middle man.,289070

119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"i have played CIV for almost 30 years, 

I have not played Civilisation 6 very long, having bought the game on steam, I miss having the physical charts and manuals, but I have been learning as I play, the game is slightly different from Civilisation 5, but vastly different from Civ IV

I had found  Civ V to have many faults and it would crash a lot.  I have problems on this version if I try and play on directx 12, but there is the choice of 11 or 12.  

I think from the original civilisation game, 1 to 4 is a progression of the original and the game is being improved, 5 and 6 is basically Civ back to the start and a complete rewrite.
What I did not like about the original CIv was there was a limit to the total number of units the game could manage, but upto that point the game was brilliant, but Civ 2 came a long and the game got bigger.

I think in terms of playing Civ I was happy on Civ III and Civ IV.  It might be that I was able to understand the interface of the game from 2 to 4 and just start playing knowing the game has slightly changed.

the main problem with Civ 6 is that the previous Civ games need updating and there isn't much improvement really needed, If I was going to choose a Civilisation game to play it would be Civ 4",289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Personally, I like CIV 6. Objectively speaking, it would be hard to recommend this game.

The CIV series was always one of my favorite strategy games. Building up your civilization from one tiny city to a world-spanning empire was and will always be fun.

Let's get the big negative out of the way. The 2K Launcher.
Which got inspired by the 4X genre. Explore, expand, exploit, exterminate.
2K explored new ways to annoy players. They expanded by introducing a new client. They exploit their player base by forcing this wreck on us. Finally, they exterminated any fun and positive reviews with it.

With that out of the way, let's get to a more detailed review.

CIV 6's aesthetics are a nice breath of fresh air and fit the game very well. Some people might prefer more realistic-looking graphics but I really like the new look.
The soundtrack is pretty solid as always, nothing to complain about there.
Sean Bean as the narrator did an amazing job, although the quotes are a bit weird sometimes. Definitely could have picked better ones for some techs, wonders and civics.

Now for the most important part, the gameplay.
CIV 6 is more casual than other titles. Every civ has its specific strengths that make them more suitable for certain builds. But you can play them pretty much however you want, at least in singleplayer. It is not a challenging or complex game and most difficulties will stem from RNG than anything else. You at least need the Rise & Fall and Gathering storm expansions, vanilla CIV 6 is way too barebone and offers little to no variety in gameplay.
Whenever I finish a singleplayer session with a civ, I always have to take a break, simply because it gets boring and repetitive after some time. You start to dominate the map way too soon and there is not a lot going on, even on higher difficulties. Emperor is probably the sweet spot for fun, Immortal and Deity can be very annoying sometimes.",289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I enjoyed this game while I could play it, but the new launcher broke it beyond playability and it crashes sometimes just sitting for a few minutes at the main menu. Wish Firaxis would fix the problems.",289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"My favorite game series since I was a kid on Civilization II but what did they do to this poor game? It seems like a recent update crashes the game and they never fixed the world builder (i.e. you can't use start locations). New features are steering away from realism. A history game with Zombies? That doesn't sit right with me. I would love to see more historical scenarios but firaxis isn't expanding on them anymore. 

From the start, Civilization VI felt outbalanced. District adjacencies will cause a player to massively outpace others. It isn't normal that I find myself with aircrafts and my buddies with swordsmen despite playing on different difficulty levels. The art is terrible with this mobile game feel to it but at least there are mods for that.

I'm waiting for a Civilization VII and I'm hoping they correct course and go back to what I loved about this game. Otherwise, I think I'll stick with their competitors like Paradox (Crusader Kings, Hearts of Iron) or Amplitude (Endless legends, Humankind).",289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"Do not recommend this game until the 2K launcher is removed and the game can launch through Steam again. I've managed to get the game to work 1/2 the time by launching directly from the Steam Files' .exe rather than using Steam, but that's just. Honestly absurd for a game that worked fine without a separate launcher. I shouldn't have to troubleshoot for 10-15 minutes to get a Steam game to run.",289070

119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,Was the game great ? I may never know.  Is 2K  the Problem or just the hours that it will take to fix this Joke of a update. Until they fix it I would suggest A Thumbs Down Review. Remember Steam is stuck just like we are so leave a thumbs down at 2K and firaxis . They are the cause of this.,289070
119,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,Strategy,289070,"I've been playing this game from the very beginning. Its had some downs in the past with certain bugs/balance changes and sometimes the DLC model is a bit pricey, but all in all it was a fun experience. Until the most recent update completely broke the game. 

The final game update has been causing all sorts of problems for players across the board, from crashing and performance issues to broken maps and content: True Start Location (TSL) are busted for many players, some game mode combinations cause the game to crash during loading, map generation can get stuck in a infinite loop, and some people can't even get into the game at all.

On top of having Civ 6's final update falling flat on its face, 2K has decided to implement a brand new launcher. Feature complete with always on DRM for paying customers convenience, causing no end of stability and performance issues both in the launcher and in-game (if you can even get the game to load).

It hurts to ""not recommend"" Civ 6 after getting so much enjoyment out of it, but in its current state I can't.

121,Total War: WARHAMMER II,Strategy,594570,"I've played just about every Total War game. After the masterpiece Shogun 2, I have not enjoyed any of them. Warhammer breathes new life into the franchise. 

The best part about this game is the battles. Remember the satisfaction of a calvary unit smashing into enemy troops? Sending a million arrows into units watching them break and flee? These joys from Rome and Shogun have been restored. Enemy AI is actually not bad, even on normal setting. 

Campaign map is HUGE. For those who like to conquer a lot of territory, you won't do any better than this map. But there is a problem with this vast size, even if you stay in your own general area of the Vortex, that being the endless computer turn. They show everything and I mean EVERYTHING. Even on the fastest camera setting, I literally had to read a book inbetween turns. Battle load times are also insanely long. 

Gameplay is smooth and solid. Controlling units is intuitive and they respond well to commands. 

It takes a while to learn to nuances of the game, but this is time well spent. The early and middle part of the game was my favorite, though it began to lose interest after a while. Most of your units you can get are superfluous. When I get a Dragon, I expect it to kick far more ass than an Eagle, but it's not much different. I found mages more trouble than they were worth. The magic spells (even the most powerful) didn't do nearly as much damage as I thought they would. 

Music is LOTR-esque. Sound/battle effects were top-notch. 

Story was textbook cliche fantasy-speak with near zero interest. A good story would have made this game memorable. As it stands, it was worth buying and playing, but I doubt I would do it again...unlike Rome and Shogun 2 which were so good they didn't need a story.

Any Star Wars fan or non Star Wars who who enjoys strategy games would really enjoy this early 2000's masterpiece. Enjoy being the next Grand Moff Tarkin, Darth Vader, Mon Mothma or Admiral Ackbar. This is not a trap. B)",32470
123,STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack,Strategy,32470,"This game is and probably always will be my favorite Star Wars game. I remember seeing a YouTube let's play series of this game with the Republic at War mod almost a decade ago when I was 9 years old, and I knew I had to get it. I ordered a copy that may have been a tad bit overpriced off ebay and played it for countless hours that aren't on steam (Except I couldn't figure out how to make mods work back then so I didn't end up playing republic at war until years later). A few years later I got a massive Star Wars bundle on Steam for sale, and this was in it. I proceeded to put hundreds of more hours into this game. 

There isn't much else to say that hasn't been said in the other reviews. It's incredibly satisfying to take over the galaxy, building up your army to colossal proportions. The space combat in particular is intense, fun, and strategic. The same cannot be said about the ground combat, however. Most of the time I end up auto-resolving land battles, which sucks because I feel like the ground vehicles and weapons in Star Wars deserve a lot more love than they get. Also, the management of your empire should be more involved. You can't start trade routes, you can't make laws or policies, and there are no systems in place that take into consideration the population of your empire. No public unrest, or amenities, or even unhappiness. All of the buildings you build go towards either the economy or warfare. It would be so cool to build arenas like the one in Attack of the Clones, or government buildings on Coruscant. Just anything really. I would go so far as to say that the galaxy overview is just barely a step above the main menu, mainly being a vessel to bring you to battles. However, it's important to remember that the game is 15 years old now, and many of the features I just talked about weren't as common or developed in the genre. I just really wish there was a little more focus on the ""Empire"" aspect in ""Empire at War"". 

After all that negative, it may seem like I don't really like the game, but that's not true at all. The ability to use heroes is really cool, and it's fun using characters you wouldn't expect, like old man obi-wan, or yoda. Some heroes can also smuggle credits or steal technologies, which adds a little more depth to them. Along with the unexpected nature of some heroes, there are some weird vehicles and planets in this game, a lot of them being their only appearance outside of books and comics. Also, the modding community is top-notch. The work that some of these people do is phenomenal, and it really turns this game into something truly special. The quantity of mods is nowhere near Minecraft or Skyrim levels, but the quality is unreal. 

Overall, I'd give the vanilla game a low 7/10 maybe even a 6.5. I have a lot of nostalgia for it, but there are definitely a lot of flaws. With mods, however, I'd give it an 8.5 or a 9. Even though it's my favorite Star Wars game, I don't think it's the best. The space combat is amazing, and the modding community is awesome, but the issues I have with the game would require a full on remake or sequel (sidenote: this should definitely happen) to be fixed. I would really only recommend this game to Star Wars fans (which granted is a massive group of people), but if you're just a strategy fan, I'd say avoid it unless it's on a deep sale.",32470
123,STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack,Strategy,32470,"I've owned this game since its original release a LOOONG time ago (as in physical disks well before the Steam era), and it's still one of the best RTS's out there. The folks at Petroglyph were mostly veterans of Westwood's C&C franchise, before EA screwed that up, and Empire at War (EaW) represents some of the finest RTS gameplay I've ever seen. Deep, uniquely Star Wars, just incredible. Beyond the Steam time I've got another solid 1000 hours, it's a game you can keep coming back to. 

With the introduction of Steamworks support a few years back, the modding scene has started moving again so once you're done with the base game, there remains thousands of hours of GOOD content out there for you to explore.

Along with the unexpected nature of some heroes, there are some weird vehicles and planets in this game, a lot of them being their only appearance outside of books and comics. Also, the modding community is top-notch. The work that some of these people do is phenomenal, and it really turns this game into something truly special. The quantity of mods is nowhere near Minecraft or Skyrim levels, but the quality is unreal. 

Overall, I'd give the vanilla game a low 7/10 maybe even a 6.5. I have a lot of nostalgia for it, but there are definitely a lot of flaws. With mods, however, I'd give it an 8.5 or a 9. Even though it's my favorite Star Wars game, I don't think it's the best. The space combat is amazing, and the modding community is awesome, but the issues I have with the game would require a full on remake or sequel (sidenote: this should definitely happen) to be fixed. I would really only recommend this game to Star Wars fans (which granted is a massive group of people), but if you're just a strategy fan, I'd say avoid it unless it's on a deep sale.",32470
123,STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack,Strategy,32470,"I've owned this game since its original release a LOOONG time ago (as in physical disks well before the Steam era), and it's still one of the best RTS's out there. The folks at Petroglyph were mostly veterans of Westwood's C&C franchise, before EA screwed that up, and Empire at War (EaW) represents some of the finest RTS gameplay I've ever seen. Deep, uniquely Star Wars, just incredible. Beyond the Steam time I've got another solid 1000 hours, it's a game you can keep coming back to. 

With the introduction of Steamworks support a few years back, the modding scene has started moving again so once you're done with the base game, there remains thousands of hours of GOOD content out there for you to explore.

Dive in, it's great.",32470

124,Slay the Spire,Strategy,646570,"Slay the Spire does a lot of things right. At face value many of the cards and relics (passives earned throughout the run) do okay things, but putting together two, three or even ten cards gives you a beautiful synergy between the effects they individually bring to the table. Even though some cards are more generally useful, like Wraith Form, every card has its place. There is a world where picking up a Claw is the best choice, even if you might not like it. Everything in Slay the Spire builds off each other, like taking a card to beat the first boss, and later taking a card that wants you to have the first one. 10/10",646570
