Nowadays I see myself tired of this game, almost playing next to none. Playing games like Halo, Half Life, CSGO, Homeworld Remastered, Hearts of Iron 4, Day of Defeat: Source, Left 4 Dead, Battlefield 4 and 1 again and having the fun of my life inside those games. That’s a moment I thought to myself: How come I have this fun again? This mysterious feeling of, I fucked up but I’m still laughing about it. This was the time it “clicked” inside my head; you see. All the games listed above encourage you to play casually, and to have fun. The games don’t take themselves seriously. Yeah yeah, CSGO has a massive Pro League behind it but, we still play it casually or? Like your friend saying: Yo man if you one click this AWP in mid with a Deagle I’ll spent ya a beer. And you of course you go ahead and do it. Even if you die, you all can laugh about it. Or you can just mess around in TDM, Conquest (Battlefield), Co-Op and I don’t know what else. \n\nRainbow Six Siege doesn’t encourage Casual Play, which it needs. It even punishes you for it.\n\nThat is sad but also true, think about “Quickmatch”, remember when it was called “Casual”? Yeah, we all miss those times, right? You can’t play Siege for fun or casually, as the game doesn’t allow it. Siege would need to make the In-Game Events playable for any given time, like Sugar Fright, Doctors Curse (And yes I know you can host Event game modes in the near future, but you would still need 9 other players for it and invite them), also Rainbow Six Siege could also add Team Death Match, where players just play for points, respawning, and killing the OPFOR (Opposing Force for all of you who don’t know what OPFOR stands for), of course they would need to make maps for this specific game mode, but wouldn’t that be better then to search for an Quickmatch where you die the moment you spawn because of spawnpeeks, or an operator that your team didn’t call out because there is no real communication going on and then wait 3 whole minutes to play again because this one teammate decides to stay on the roof on Bank to “save his K/D”. Quickmatch is also infuriating for many players as they play most of the time solo or with a buddy and then have to sweat for nothing just because the 9th million Jaeger or Ash main destroys you and treats it as ranked and even shit talks you in the chat. It becomes tiresome and frustrating. But hey atleast the Devs put much effort into making events and event maps that we can only play for a limited time, instead of adding fresh new game modes to a game that would really need it.  \n\nNow as we are on the “adding” things. The game is stale. There is no need to lie as even a hardcore fan must admit that it is really boring as of right now. Flores didn’t add much to the game and is almost forgotten, as a Maverick or Zofia/Ash does the job much better than him (In my opinion, which can differ greatly to everyone to any region) because they aren’t handicaped because of Mute and or Mozzi which you see often in the game. With the new Season North Star or however it is called the new healing Operator Thunderbird is also underwhelming, as people tend to use Doc because of the MP 5. Giving her the ability for the Spear .308 won’t change to much about it, even if it is an Assault Rifle that she gets doesn’t mean that she will be strong…. And even will be nerfed before she even comes out like they did with Flores. The same applies to the Jager nerf. Who in their right mind though it’s a good idea to nerf his gun? If you think about it, the Devs wanted to make roaming with him harder as he can’t be as strong in firefights anymore as before. But its his ability that makes him great and the gun as people love playing with. It looks cool, works smooth and is satisfying. And removing 5 bullets and an increase of vertical recoil won’t affect him to much, as he is still a viable Operator with a satisfying gun and the best gadget in the whole game. \n\nWe must wait now for almost a year for the Nokk buff and Melusi nerf. Nokk is not picked often and would be greatly improved with it, while Melusi is not only overpicked but is also a really strong operator and great intel giver (As her Banshees have these wobble sound effects when you come near them), but oh yeah right Melusi got “nerfed” by removing the T-5 and replacing it with the MP5… Fuck sake Ubisoft whatever you smoked, stop it or at least give me some of it too. \n\nBan phases OH BOY, OH MAN. How about you guys just fucking delete this system and just implement one like CSGO has? Where can you choose the Maps, you want to play on? Instead of having 3 different random maps chosen for you where you “ban” with the opposing team, but you still end up banning Bank together and now it chooses between Theme Park and Oregon? Great thing right. I mean Yeah, this whole Map ban system is complete worthless as it still is random which map you play on. In theory it works, but practically it doesn’t. I guess I can give the “At least you tried” award to you guys for this one feature. \n\nToxicity is something you guys are working actively against, but still, it shows no real impact. Even with your new system that will come with the Trust Factor won’t be doing too much against it. Look at Overwatch, the whole community there is toxic as hell (and yes, I played Overwatch back in 2016 as some friends forced me to it) this is something that every heavy competitive game must go through, as players become actively frustrated because of their teammates and the enemy, being hardstuck Gold I for the entire season and don’t even rank up as they clearly show a higher skill level, unlike their team. And still play against Diamond players. But eh, guess this is how things are now. \n\nUbisoft, you must do much more to the game then you imagine. The way you handle it as a “very serious tactical Competitive shooter” doesn’t work, don’t forget the casual players. And no don’t tell me: you didn’t forget about them, and that you try everything possible to make everyone happy, as this is not the case. Don’t listen to much what Plat 1 – Champion players say and what the Pro league says. It’s the same with Zofias withstand mechanic, for all the years it worked perfectly fine, after this one match in Pro League it got removed as it “Didn’t fit into Rainbow Six Siege and not because of this Stream” I call bullshit, as it was a great mechanic, and I never felt that it is unfair, as only Zofia could do it with only 5 HP, and most of the time you still died but it defined her character. \n\nIn my opinion, you guys miss the mark in what Rainbow Six Siege wants to be, you treat it as a very serious tactical shooter. But the more serious it gets; the more frustrated players will be. They stop playing the game because they burn out and can’t have fun in it and eventually leave. New Players can’t get a foot in the door, as they either get demolished by smurfs or good players and maybe play the game 5 hours and eventually leave when they meet with a very sweaty and toxic community. The game is stale for long term players as you don’t make new maps we can play on and create new tactics (if you can call them tactics anymore), no real interesting operator. No new weapons that spice things up again. \nI think there is even more to add to this review, but it already is too long, and I thank you all who have read this far. I think that everyone who comes across this review should also add their own opinion to the current state of the game, which I enc', 'Very good game if you hate yourself and wanna torture your mind', 'devs destroyed the game', 'after supporting this game for so long... i cannot recommend siege because of the direction they are heading', 'I\'ve been playing this game since release, and while I don\'t hate the game for what it is today, it has just lost the spark of that incredibly tactical and realistic feel. I\'m not one to go ""new=bad"", and there were sci-fi elements on release (like Jager\'s anti-grenades, though they were all believable back then), but what I enjoyed about the game is gone at this point. You won\'t find the tactical shooter where every death massively changes the game and teamwork is essential to every step in a realistic feel, but a load of a million different traps you have to get around, memorizing what 50+ characters do to even be able to fight them, characters that their abilities feel like they\'re meant for a game (not an actual raid scenario), and devs pushing out power-creep characters, making the classics rarely used. (like seriously what did they do to thatcher?) It took them 6 years to make the most useless operator (Tachanka) into something good. Did they do this with other useless operators? Castle? Nope.

Nowadays I see myself tired of this game, almost playing next to none. Playing games like Halo, Half Life, CSGO, Homeworld Remastered, Hearts of Iron 4, Day of Defeat: Source, Left 4 Dead, Battlefield 4 and 1 again and having the fun of my life inside those games. That’s a moment I thought to myself: How come I have this fun again? This mysterious feeling of, I fucked up but I’m still laughing about it. This was the time it “clicked” inside my head; you see. All the games listed above encourage you to play casually, and to have fun. The games don’t take themselves seriously. Yeah yeah, CSGO has a massive Pro League behind it but, we still play it casually or? Like your friend saying: Yo man if you one click this AWP in mid with a Deagle I’ll spent ya a beer. And you of course you go ahead and do it. Even if you die, you all can laugh about it. Or you can just mess around in TDM, Conquest (Battlefield), Co-Op and I don’t know what else. \n\nRainbow Six Siege doesn’t encourage Casual Play, which it needs. It even punishes you for it.\n\nThat is sad but also true, think about “Quickmatch”, remember when it was called “Casual”? Yeah, we all miss those times, right? You can’t play Siege for fun or casually, as the game doesn’t allow it. Siege would need to make the In-Game Events playable for any given time, like Sugar Fright, Doctors Curse (And yes I know you can host Event game modes in the near future, but you would still need 9 other players for it and invite them), also Rainbow Six Siege could also add Team Death Match, where players just play for points, respawning, and killing the OPFOR (Opposing Force for all of you who don’t know what OPFOR stands for), of course they would need to make maps for this specific game mode, but wouldn’t that be better then to search for an Quickmatch where you die the moment you spawn because of spawnpeeks, or an operator that your team didn’t call out because there is no real communication going on and then wait 3 whole minutes to play again because this one teammate decides to stay on the roof on Bank to “save his K/D”. Quickmatch is also infuriating for many players as they play most of the time solo or with a buddy and then have to sweat for nothing just because the 9th million Jaeger or Ash main destroys you and treats it as ranked and even shit talks you in the chat. It becomes tiresome and frustrating. But hey atleast the Devs put much effort into making events and event maps that we can only play for a limited time, instead of adding fresh new game modes to a game that would really need it.  \n\nNow as we are on the “adding” things. The game is stale. There is no need to lie as even a hardcore fan must admit that it is really boring as of right now.

You can shoot a gun that shoots guns that shoot your friends. Or bad guys. Sometimes the bad guys shoot each other. Sometimes the good guys shoot each other. The most handsome guy in the game is a bad guy. The most annoying character in the game is a good guy. There\'s a gun that screams. Like, vocal screaming. There are dudes that just scream in general.

That seems to be a rare commodity nowadays. You\'ll meet some recurring characters from the original Borderlands as well as brand new characters. To me, there isn\'t a single character where I\'d rather not see them in the game. Each character is very well written, and they blend together to form one of the most interesting stories in modern entertainment. The only reason the story doesn\'t earn a Masterpiece rating from me is because it is a bit cliche. Good guys defeat bad guy and save the world. The path that the good guys take to defeat the bad guy is what\'s very engaging.\n\n===[ ☼ Visuals/Graphics: ]===\n☐ Masterpiece\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Average\n☐ Poor\n☐ Visual catastrophe\n☐ Ask M.

Love the characters & personalities, the jokes, and stunning scenery of post-apocalyptic & steampunk combined. There are a lot of interesting quests like: you massacre every enemies or find treasures. The main characters are just awesome! They have different skills (don't forget the costumes!) so you can choose whatever character's skill do you like. I really like the weapons design, it's like every weapon is one of a kind.\n\nAlthough the game was good, it has flaws. I [b]REALLY HATE[/b] the timed quest. I want to enjoy the game not speedrunning it. And the reward.. well.. not worth it.. I can't play co-op too, maybe because of the internet connection...\n\nThis game is awesome. Though old, but it still fun to play solo or with friends and has replay value. Buy the DLC too, it's worth it!\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nRating: 9/10"", 'i love this game', 'pure definition of fun. awesome game', 'full of borders', 'Played the heck out of this game on Xbox and PC. Takes all the awesome things about the first one and makes them even better. Think Rick and Morty if it was a looter shooter. And a DnD DLC? Awesome! A must cop!', 'hehe shoot me in the face', 'In spite of my overall recommended rating, there are some things that you should probably know about this game.\nFirstly is the mechanism of the ""looter shooter"" part of the game. In order to actually farm for weapons and items, you have to re-enter a level from the main menu every single time; there is no boss respawn mechanic in levels, which makes this necessary part of the game sometimes incredibly frustrating. This is especially so when trying to get legendary loot.\nThere are mods (custom launchers) that fix this issue, but I shouldn\'t have to download a launcher - why isn\'t this part of the base game? It\'s a looter-shooter, how did they not expect people to need to farm the same boss or bosses over again? Thankfully for me, load times are amongst the shortest I\'ve seen, but I know that will not be the case for everyone, which may make the experience even more gruelling. \n\nAnother problem so far has been co-op play. The entirety of the way, I\'ve been playing this with 3 other friends, which has made the experience considerably more difficult. How strange, given that this IS meant to be a co-op game. We frequently find ourselves underleveled for areas simply because playing in co-op splits the experience but doesn\'t adjust for 4 players. This sort of issue doesn\'t happen in singleplayer. Ironic.\n\nMy third and final gripe is the zer0 Sniper class, who I\'ve been focusing on this entire time. I would briefly like to point out the stupidity of having a melee branch with no genuine melee weapons - asides from that, the Sniper class can feel quite redundant at times. Critical hitboxes are both small and in sometimes ridiculous places, or are totally not existent at all - and even when shot, do not crit properly. Many engagements are in close quarters, and when playing with 4 people, ""getting hurt"" animations can increase the difficulty in landing headshots.\nI get this is going to be partially out of my own aim, but all the other factors can sometimes make Sniper Zer0 feel like a chore. \n\nAs for the positives of this game...\n+ The gunplay CAN feel amazing\n+ There\'s an incredible addictiveness to getting good loot\n+ Landing headshots CAN be satisfying\n+ The game looks awesome even on the worst settings\n\nSo overall, I recommend it. Is it worth $20? Debatable, but I bought it only sale (only about $7) and I would say I\'m satisfied with my purchase so far. I think fundamentally some of the game\'s design choices turned out to be poor, especially with so much DLC and the issues mentioned above; every game has it\'s flaws. \n\nIn spite of those things, it is probably worth a try.\n/ / /\n', '<3', 'funni\n', 'wow great game id say!! games started to suck butt after this masterpiece', 'shoot', 'still a whole lot better than borderlands 3', ""A future to No future Game.\n\nonce you play you really can't stop.

Among the witty one-liners, unique humor, intriguing story, and deep characters is some rather addictive gameplay. You can shoot bad guys. You can shoot your friends. You can shoot a gun that shoots guns that shoot your friends. Or bad guys. Sometimes the bad guys shoot each other. Sometimes the good guys shoot each other. The most handsome guy in the game is a bad guy. The most annoying character in the game is a good guy. There\'s a gun that screams. Like, vocal screaming. There are dudes that just scream in general. You can have all this just cause you feel like it.\n\nArguably the best entry to the Borderlands universe.\n\n===[ $ Price Index: ]===\n☑ Worth even MORE than full price\n☐ Completely worth full price\n☐ Wait for a sale\n☐ Be prepared to refund this title\n☐ No Man\'s Sky (Do not ever purchase this abomination to the gaming industry)\n\nI frequently see this game on sale for like $5.

I have probably clocked hundreds, if not thousands of hours on just Borderlands 2 alone on the Xbox 360 for how fun it is to play with friends.\n\n===[ ☀ Story: ] ===\n☐ Masterpiece\n☑ Memorable\n☐ Good\n☐ Average\n☐ Poor\n☐ None\n\nIn this age of kind of crappy storytelling, Gearbox can still deliver games with very engaging stories without sacrificing gameplay quality. That seems to be a rare commodity nowadays. You\'ll meet some recurring characters from the original Borderlands as well as brand new characters. To me, there isn\'t a single character where I\'d rather not see them in the game. Each character is very well written, and they blend together to form one of the most interesting stories in modern entertainment. The only reason the story doesn\'t earn a Masterpiece rating from me is because it is a bit cliche. Good guys defeat bad guy and save the world. The path that the good guys take to defeat the bad guy is what\'s very engaging.\n\n===[ ☼ Visuals/Graphics: ]===\n☐ Masterpiece\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Average\n☐ Poor\n☐ Visual catastrophe\n☐ Ask M. Night Shyamalan to make a movie of it\n\nFor a 2012 game, it still looks fantastic. Some of the animations definitely look outdated, but most of the time, you\'re paying attention to the plot more than anything so there\'s a good chance you\'ll miss the weird-ish animations.\n\n===[ ♬ Sounds/Music: ]===\n☐ Masterpiece (Beethoven is smiling in his grave)\n☑ Memorable\n☐ Good\n☐ Average\n☐ Poor\n☐ Do not put your ears through this terror\n\nThe music is pretty good. There are little jingles and tunes here and there that you\'ll likely remember for a long time.

Love the characters & personalities, the jokes, and stunning scenery of post-apocalyptic & steampunk combined. There are a lot of interesting quests like: you massacre every enemies or find treasures. The main characters are just awesome! They have different skills (don't forget the costumes!) so you can choose whatever character's skill do you like. I really like the weapons design, it's like every weapon is one of a kind.\n\nAlthough the game was good, it has flaws. I [b]REALLY HATE[/b] the timed quest. I want to enjoy the game not speedrunning it. And the reward.. well.. not worth it.. I can't play co-op too, maybe because of the internet connection...\n\nThis game is awesome. Though old, but it still fun to play solo or with friends and has replay value. Buy the DLC too, it's worth it!\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nRating: 9/10"", 'i love this game', 'pure definition of fun. awesome game', 'full of borders', 'Played the heck out of this game on Xbox and PC. Takes all the awesome things about the first one and makes them even better. Think Rick and Morty if it was a looter shooter. And a DnD DLC? Awesome! A must cop!', 'hehe shoot me in the face', 'In spite of my overall recommended rating, there are some things that you should probably know about this game.\nFirstly is the mechanism of the ""looter shooter"" part of the game. In order to actually farm for weapons and items, you have to re-enter a level from the main menu every single time; there is no boss respawn mechanic in levels, which makes this necessary part of the game sometimes incredibly frustrating. This is especially so when trying to get legendary loot.\nThere are mods (custom launchers) that fix this issue, but I shouldn\'t have to download a launcher - why isn\'t this part of the base game? It\'s a looter-shooter, how did they not expect people to need to farm the same boss or bosses over again? Thankfully for me, load times are amongst the shortest I\'ve seen, but I know that will not be the case for everyone, which may make the experience even more gruelling. \n\nAnother problem so far has been co-op play. The entirety of the way, I\'ve been playing this with 3 other friends, which has made the experience considerably more difficult. How strange, given that this IS meant to be a co-op game. We frequently find ourselves underleveled for areas simply because playing in co-op splits the experience but doesn\'t adjust for 4 players. This sort of issue doesn\'t happen in singleplayer. Ironic.\n\nMy third and final gripe is the zer0 Sniper class, who I\'ve been focusing on this entire time. I would briefly like to point out the stupidity of having a melee branch with no genuine melee weapons - asides from that, the Sniper class can feel quite redundant at times. Critical hitboxes are both small and in sometimes ridiculous places, or are totally not existent at all - and even when shot, do not crit properly. Many engagements are in close quarters, and when playing with 4 people, ""getting hurt"" animations can increase the difficulty in landing headshots.\nI get this is going to be partially out of my own aim, but all the other factors can sometimes make Sniper Zer0 feel like a chore. \n\nAs for the positives of this game...\n+ The gunplay CAN feel amazing\n+ There\'s an incredible addictiveness to getting good loot\n+ Landing headshots CAN be satisfying\n+ The game looks awesome even on the worst settings\n\nSo overall, I recommend it. Is it worth $20? Debatable, but I bought it only sale (only about $7) and I would say I\'m satisfied with my purchase so far. I think fundamentally some of the game\'s design choices turned out to be poor, especially with so much DLC and the issues mentioned above; every game has it\'s flaws. \n\nIn spite of those things, it is probably worth a try.\n/ / /\n', '<3', 'funni\n']"

Even if you are not into action roguelikes or Greek mythology, this game is still worth trying out for the sake of an authentic experience.\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\n\nEvery so often, a dedicated and highly talented person or a group of people creates a masterpiece like any other – with their own vision, style, and storytelling. Hades is a game only Supergiant Games could make. It is monumental, both for the roguelike genre and as a video game in general; a must-play for everyone.\n\nLet me start from afar. Video games as a medium are a way to escape unpleasant or uneventful everyday life. It is escapism, a necessary psychological device to divert thoughts from sadness, loss, or boredom. You can see it in every type of entertainment humans have, not merely video games. Likewise, roguelikes have deep roots in literal “escape” concerning their narrative (the hero always tries to escape a dungeon or labyrinth of sorts or even their fate). We might call it double escapism. At the same time, stories in most roguelikes only distantly resemble real-life situations. That is where Supergiant makes a difference. They not only create an addictive game with exceptional style and music, but they also tell a deeply allegorical coming-of-age story. You know, the type of story every one of us lives through at some point because there are no ideal families, as well as relationships. Maybe some will not see it like that, but this allegory penetrates every aspect of Hades. It returns you from the whimsical world (or should I say Underworld?) to your everyday life with new feelings, thoughts, and a desire to sort everything through. That is the highest praise I could imagine for an entertainment medium.\n\nHades follows the story of Zagreus and his relationship with his tyrant father, Hades, the god of the Underworld himself. I love Greek mythology and Ancient Greek literature, and I must admit the level of detail is brilliant. There are many myths from different sources; Supergiant chooses its interpretations very carefully, so the story feels consistent. They had a certain degree of freedom regarding the protagonist and his relations with everyone due to his lesser significance in Greek mythology. Even there, though, in late interactions with Dionysus, we can learn how the whole “Orphic Dionysus Zagreus” tradition might have an internal explanation. So, yeah, the level of detail is brilliant, I mean it! Zagreus, or Zag for short, is a young godling who wants to escape his dull life in the Underworld. Hades (the god) demands from his son, whom he scornfully calls “boy,” to be responsible, respectful, and obedient. At the same time, he is reluctant to show his love or appreciation. For Zag, there is only one way to deal with it: running away to relatives on Olympus. The problem, though, is that no one can escape the Underworld, even a godling! And so we start our desperate journey as Zag, trying to leave the domain of the dead. The story is deep and meaningful; its narration goes through many dialogs with different characters, intertwined between escape attempts into one whole piece. Slowly, the perspective shifts: the initial father-son conflict reveals underlying problems and broader themes. My favorite includes exercising honesty and outspokenness and why it is not always the best course of action in a manifold family to tell everything head-on.\n\nGameplay-wise, Hades is as addictive as a perfect roguelike should be. You have to rely on your wit, reaction (sometimes even sense of rhythm), and, of course, luck to fight your way through the ever-changing environment with hundreds of possible adjustments to strategy and tactics. I could play games like Crypt of the NecroDancer or Dicey Dungeons in short sessions, but Hades? Nope. I play it, and play it, and play it. Again and again. It is so very addictive! Different weapons, boons, power-ups, and their combinations result in some weird and powerful twists to efficient tactics, which is an example of RNG done right. If you die, you can start again a bit stronger (if you gathered enough Darkness, that is) through the process amusingly called Reflecting. Due to its core mechanics, the game can be frustrating, but that only means your character has not been powerful enough to beat something as of yet. Just play some more, and you will naturally overcome the obstacle. It starts to feel repetitive only when you finish the main story. At that point, the only way of raising the challenge is through the Pact of Punishment, a plot device to make your post-story runs harder.\n\nAs always with Supergiant, the voice acting and music are exceptional. Beautiful melodies combined with heavier riffs and reverberations suit the game’s style and story greatly. And when Orpheus (Darren Korb, the composer) and Eurydice (Ashley Barrett) start singing, their verses seem to be out of this world. It is not a simple task to assume the roles of the legendary musician and his muse and sing their parts convincingly. Somehow, Darren and Ashley pull it out. I had tears and goosebumps listening to In the Blood after finishing the game! Truly magnificent.\n\nLastly, I want to briefly mention the Fated List of Minor Prophecies which adds depth to the choice-making during escape attempts, and the detailed statistics menu for your runs. Little nuances like these contribute to the entire thing, making it much more enjoyable. And, well, there is also fishing. Because why not?', 'Flurry Jab is fast. Other hammers are not fast. Therefore, we want flurry jab. And we do flurry resets until we get it.\nI beat this game in less than 8 minutes. \nPlease help.', ""Hades has an [b] amazing story, [/b] with [b] fantastic storytelling.

Video games as a medium are a way to escape unpleasant or uneventful everyday life. It is escapism, a necessary psychological device to divert thoughts from sadness, loss, or boredom. You can see it in every type of entertainment humans have, not merely video games. Likewise, roguelikes have deep roots in literal “escape” concerning their narrative (the hero always tries to escape a dungeon or labyrinth of sorts or even their fate). We might call it double escapism. At the same time, stories in most roguelikes only distantly resemble real-life situations. That is where Supergiant makes a difference. They not only create an addictive game with exceptional style and music, but they also tell a deeply allegorical coming-of-age story. You know, the type of story every one of us lives through at some point because there are no ideal families, as well as relationships. Maybe some will not see it like that, but this allegory penetrates every aspect of Hades. It returns you from the whimsical world (or should I say Underworld?) to your everyday life with new feelings, thoughts, and a desire to sort everything through. That is the highest praise I could imagine for an entertainment medium.\n\nHades follows the story of Zagreus and his relationship with his tyrant father, Hades, the god of the Underworld himself. I love Greek mythology and Ancient Greek literature, and I must admit the level of detail is brilliant. There are many myths from different sources; Supergiant chooses its interpretations very carefully, so the story feels consistent. They had a certain degree of freedom regarding the protagonist and his relations with everyone due to his lesser significance in Greek mythology. Even there, though, in late interactions with Dionysus, we can learn how the whole “Orphic Dionysus Zagreus” tradition might have an internal explanation. So, yeah, the level of detail is brilliant, I mean it! Zagreus, or Zag for short, is a young godling who wants to escape his dull life in the Underworld. Hades (the god) demands from his son, whom he scornfully calls “boy,” to be responsible, respectful, and obedient. At the same time, he is reluctant to show his love or appreciation. For Zag, there is only one way to deal with it: running away to relatives on Olympus. The problem, though, is that no one can escape the Underworld, even a godling! And so we start our desperate journey as Zag, trying to leave the domain of the dead. The story is deep and meaningful; its narration goes through many dialogs with different characters, intertwined between escape attempts into one whole piece. Slowly, the perspective shifts: the initial father-son conflict reveals underlying problems and broader themes. My favorite includes exercising honesty and outspokenness and why it is not always the best course of action in a manifold family to tell everything head-on.\n\nGameplay-wise, Hades is as addictive as a perfect roguelike should be. You have to rely on your wit, reaction (sometimes even sense of rhythm), and, of course, luck to fight your way through the ever-changing environment with hundreds of possible adjustments to strategy and tactics. I could play games like Crypt of the NecroDancer or Dicey Dungeons in short sessions, but Hades? Nope. I play it, and play it, and play it. Again and again. It is so very addictive! Different weapons, boons, power-ups, and their combinations result in some weird and powerful twists to efficient tactics, which is an example of RNG done right. If you die, you can start again a bit stronger (if you gathered enough Darkness, that is) through the process amusingly called Reflecting. Due to its core mechanics, the game can be frustrating, but that only means your character has not been powerful enough to beat something as of yet. Just play some more, and you will naturally overcome the obstacle. It starts to feel repetitive only when you finish the main story. At that point, the only way of raising the challenge is through the Pact of Punishment, a plot device to make your post-story runs harder.\n\nAs always with Supergiant, the voice acting and music are exceptional. Beautiful melodies combined with heavier riffs and reverberations suit the game’s style and story greatly. And when Orpheus (Darren Korb, the composer) and Eurydice (Ashley Barrett) start singing, their verses seem to be out of this world. It is not a simple task to assume the roles of the legendary musician and his muse and sing their parts convincingly. Somehow, Darren and Ashley pull it out. I had tears and goosebumps listening to In the Blood after finishing the game! Truly magnificent.\n\nLastly, I want to briefly mention the Fated List of Minor Prophecies which adds depth to the choice-making during escape attempts, and the detailed statistics menu for your runs. Little nuances like these contribute to the entire thing, making it much more enjoyable. And, well, there is also fishing. Because why not?', 'Flurry Jab is fast. Other hammers are not fast. Therefore, we want flurry jab. And we do flurry resets until we get it.\nI beat this game in less than 8 minutes. \nPlease help.', ""Hades has an [b] amazing story, [/b] with [b] fantastic storytelling. [/b] It also has an [b] excellent soundtrack and artstyle, [/b] [b] superb combat, [/b] and [b] great voice acting. [/b] \n\nIn this game every death feels like a reward as you grow stronger. The progression, and character development is well thought out. The runs are unique because the chambers are always different, and you never know what you'll find. You can even alter the fate, and make your own boon combinations from the ground up, with the weapon you chose.\nThe combat is fluid and addicting. However, if you're here for the story, there is God Mode which gives damage reduction. \n\nEvery other roguelike felt too grindy and boring for me, but this one is just different.\nHades is a [b] must play masterpiece. [/b] Really worth the price."", ""I love this game so much and I can't stop talking/thinking about it. It's just amazing. I have only 35 hours on steam because my controller stopped working so I ended up buying it on the switch (I basically have about 75 hours at the time of this review) so I can play it because I couldn't not play it lmao. The art the music the story the voice acting the gameplay literally every aspect that you would expect from a good game and maybe even more. I'm just in shock by the amount of things you can do in this game and I think I'll continue to play it for a long time to come. Thank you for this Supergiant and thank you Jen for the amazing art you're an inspiration!"", 'great game, must play for voice actors tbh', 'Hades is a rougelike game that actually incorporates the concept of ""doing runs over and over"" in a way that makes sense into it\'s story. You\'re not just doing this because its a videogame, rather because in the context of the game its an actual mechanic and a ""normal behavior"".\nIn this game you will likely die in early chambers when you begin, but this is pretty much on par to how the game is designed, as you play more you will not only get better at handling Zagreus and learn enemy patterns, but also collect resources to make future runs easier, as you\'ll be able to permanently upgrade yourself, making future attempts more likely to succeed.\nThe main powers you acquire are derived from Olympian gods, each offering their own set of effects that you can equip to your main moves, or just gain passive buffs that might alter how you approach a given run, there\'s also 6 different weapons that can later even gain new alterations, even though the game encourages you to try all weapons by buffing the rewards you earn if you use a specific one during your next run, you might just find your favorite one and use it to achieve more victories.\nThe game also has a wide cast of charming characters that you\'ll be able to interact with during and before/after a run, deepening your relationship with each as you progress and eventually even unlocking sub stories related to them, allowing them to grow more as characters and friends of yours.\nOverall this game is a great experience, and from popular word, even if you\'re unfamiliar with the rougelike genre, this game has proven to find their way to be liked by these people. There is a lot of extra unlockables you can pursue if you decide to, and the game even allows you to pump up the difficulty with set modifiers, to test the skill of those seeking for a greater challenge.\nThe true GOTY of 2020.', 'Bought because it keeps appearing in front of my face! Got to say that is my best decision ever! Never going to regret buying the game, I dont usually play these kind of games, but Hades keeps me interested.', 'Hades is an amazing game, give it a try.\nThe mechanics are fun, the music is really cool and the graphics are amazing. \n+ They actually voiced everyone in this game and its perfect. \nEveryone has a voice that matches the character perfectly.', 'really addicting i love it \n\nalso hypnos best boy', 'Great game for people who like to experiment with different kinds of play style.', 'A stroke of pure genius. The graphics are beautiful, the voice acting is amazing, and the music is overwhelming. The rogue-like concept is incorporated in such an amazing fashion that makes me love it, although I usually dislike rogue-likes.\n\nGood story-telling, game design, and an incredible replayability. I have rarely played another game 50+ hours after getting all achievements.\n\nHats off, Supergiant!', 'Game of the year 2020', ""Amazing artwork, interesting story, and so many different combinations of skills and challenges that no two runs will be the same. One of the best rogue-lite games I've played."", ""I almost committed one of the biggest crimes in gaming history: forgot to give this masterpiece a proper positive review after I've done playing it for over a hundred hours. So yeah, that's how good this game is."", 'its ok', 'lmao easily goty 2020', ""Usually, I'm not a rogue-like guy (I hate having to restart).\nUsually, I very (very) rarely play a single-player game more than ~20h.\nUsually...\n\nWell this game is nothing usual and got me for 80h and counting ! \nI even reached 100% achievements without getting bored/annoyed a single time.\n\nI knew SuperGiant Games were amazing but this one.. Oh my!  Story, characters, combat, songs(!!)... it checks all the boxes :o \n\nI only regret having bought it during sales, it clearly deserves to be bought at full price !\n\n(Ok, I wish there was a coop/multiplayer option but hey, can't have it all :p )"", 'xDDDDDDD']"

I probably won't be replaying it anytime soon, but I enjoyed most of the playthrough very much.\n\nThis is a movie game. Quick time events, running on platforms that are crumbling with every step, and LOTS AND LOTS OF CLIMBING. Alternate title could be Rock Climber Simulator 2013 (laugh). \n\nThe combat was good, with four different guns with upgrades. I really wouldn't call this a third person shooter, but yeah there's a lot. The next thing is the climbing. I'm going to be honest, I love platformers, and I loive the sections where you're climbing up a deteriorating bridge and stuff, but sometimes climbing rocks feels tedious.\n\nI liked the story, it was simple, the cutscenes didn't go on too long and the cinematic gameplay is some of the best I've seen. Overall, this game was great, I got it for only $2.24, I will definitely think about buying the sequels."", ""Tomb Raider is not a perfect game but it's definitely worth a shot!\n\n1. Music: 2/10\n2. Story: 6.5/10\n3. Level Design 10/10\n4. Gameplay 9/10\n\nThe game is really good, it progresses really nicely, the characters are all well thought out, the level design is great and intractable, and game mechanics are nice and unique. But sadly it does have some downsides, for example the auditory experience of the game is nothing to write home about (its just downright boring). And while the story is good, the beginning and the end of it don't really contrast well. And for a 2013 game the enemy AI seems very robotic and outdated.\n\n7/10 - Overall Tomb Raider is a great game and you should give it a try! \n\nSide note: This is a relatively old game so it should run good on slower hardware in my case it ran at a consistent 60fps on my mx130 laptop on the lowest settings."", 'Amazing gemplay, nice graphics, great plot.

The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,292030,"['Imagine you\'re working in a 9-5 corporate job, you\'re done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you\'re never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar. While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn\'t the games, its you. ""Its not that games aren\'t fun anymore, you have gotten older"".\n\nAnd then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can\'t wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist\' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....""Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?"" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who\'s dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven\'t felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that\'s shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?\n\nAnd I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feeling I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven\'t scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""Witcher 3 TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven\'t done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That\'s how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.\n\nThank you CD Projekt Red. You guys are a gem.

(in my opinion)', ""Words can simply not describe how much I love this game, but will certainly do my best:\n\nCharacters - Existing characters such as Geralt, Triss, Ciri, Dandelion, Yen, Keira (plus Shani and Regis for the expansions) have been utilized brilliantly from the source material and used so well in the world the game has created, and boy what a world it is! The characters I previously mentioned are probably the ones that stood out for me the most, but to be honest there are so many brilliantly constructed characters (even minor ones like Bart the Rock Troll) that I simply don't know where to even begin... Geralt's interaction with most them is simply brilliant, and the game has so many amazing, memorable moments because of it (including the famous 'drinking game segment' at Kaer Morgen). You also get a logged back story for each character, most of it taken from the books and/or previous games. which is brilliant if, like me, you decided to read the books afterwards or couldn't be bothered playing through the first couple of Witcher games (although I did get through 3 stages of the original game). It's obviously more important to have this as there is alot of stuff in the game that needs back story to elaborate on, weither it be a situation or certain dialogue. Oh yes the dialogue, love love love some of conversations in this game. You can tell alot of thought and effort went into it. The character dialogue for the most part, particularly for Geralt is so complex and funny. As it is with certain other characters mind you, but Geralt's obviously stands out the most\n\nEnvironment - The graphics and art design for all the environments are simply brilliant, each location had its own distinctive feel and is and absolute joy to explore (I spent about 2 weeks just exploring Skellege's oceans and vast landscapes)\n\nMonsters/Enemies - Such a huge assorted variety, honestly you can never get bored with the variety of enemies you face. I also love that each monster has it's own unique methods of quickly being dispelled, and everytime you discover something a description will pop up in the beast log, breaking up everything into different categories aswell\n\nStory - Soooo gooood. Honestly story elements wise, I don't think any game is going to even come remotely close. Especially given that so many of the side stories actually match, and even sometimes exceed, the complexity and epicness of the main storyline\n\nCombat - Kept interesting through the graphic, stylized fighting and dismemberment. Aswell as the additional use of things like signs and potions. Once again you usually need to use certain combinations of things to kill my monsters more easily, particularly the more defined 'boss level' ones\n\nExpansions - BRILLIANT. Hearts of Stone has truely amazing story and character elements. While Blood and Wine does this on a slightly lower scale but adds another beautiful environment with various new enemies to face\n\nSo basically this the best I can do to some up how epic The Witcher 3 is. But honestly, just play the damn game!!!\n\nMy Rating for this game - 10/10"", ""I don't know how to describe this experience. My steam adventure started with The Witcher: Enhanced Edition game, which allowed me to open a steam account. As a console player, I didn't think I would be a computer player, but the witcher series also made me love computer controls.Also, i played the first two games with computer controls, it was fun, but witcher 3 was a game that made me buy a gamepad.The first two games really felt like I was in the game with their open worlds and quality stories. You know, there are some special games that you feel empty when finished. I guess that's how I feel right now. I tried to explore every part of the world and do side quests as much as I could, but I still couldn't get enough of it. This game is a masterpiece for me as an open world and story. There are missions that balance the border between funny and seriousness very well. It is a game that I started late but never tired of playing. I guess it's like a game series that I will play again and again after a certain time. At least it's worth seeing Geralt again ^^"", 'What is the premise of life and how is it intertwined with destiny? Some believe that their existence is to perform grand deeds, whilst others contentedly was little girls in basins, an occupation that I earnestly desire. Geralt was one of these men who had a destiny, a goal to slaughter the mentally handicapped, whilst venturing off to pollinate with their caregivers. His aim and dedication in slaughtering the mentally deficient earnt him the ire of various human rights committees who dubbed him the White Wolf, a name inspired by his peculiar habits of skinning his prey alive, to then don them as a cloak. Geralt’s work was so effective that many, from a petulant child, to a mother, fatigued with cleaning out her handicapped child’s waste, and having to spoon fed him intangible jellies as sustenance, frequently contracted the White Wolf to slaughter whatever mouth drivelling, rabid imbecile was assigned. Often the contractors that hired Geralt to slaughter the handicapped were families, or a fuming neighbour, disgruntled over being nightly woken by a mentally handicapped banshee, slamming together two frying pans at the stroke of midnight, whilst serenading an incoherent, intelligible tune. On other occasions he was assigned high profile contracts, most prominently of them all, was the bellower of Castle Whistlewood, a contract he was issues by an individual who wishes to remain anonymous. \n\nThe bellower of Castle Whislewood, otherwise regarded as Steven Dawson, was a distant relative of Austin Powers and was generally emotionally volatile, mentally decrepit simpleton with Tourette’s and Autism. Frequently the belower would trail after woman and utter guttural howls, coupled in with vehement obscenities such as “Hello Baby” and “Ding Dong”. All Geralt would have to do is attach an inflatable female doll, scantily clad and with a seductive pose, to a cliff face. In theory, the imbecile, observing such a hedonistic toy would wholeheartedly believe that the woman was genuine and as such would rush towards her, tripping along the way and plummeting to his demise. Unfortunately, this was not a typical case. Steven Dawson was the governing monarch of Castle Whistlewood, an enclosed building, barred away from civilisaiton and comprised of solely him and his thralls. His thralls in question were regarded as the NDSP, the National Disability Support Partners and were sworn to defend him to their dying day. This task would be relatively difficult to complete, as the bellower bore an army at his disposal, one that could call for security and otherwise repel an ill prepared assault if need be. Aware of such a fact, Geralt began to psychologically and mentally prepare. To ward of the evil spirits, he clad himself and his blades in the finest baby oils that Poland had to offer. Then he acquired a mallet to crack open the bellowers skull. Alongside the weapon, four shrapnel grenades were concocted, in the event that Geralt would be required to clear out a throng of adversaries. During preparation, Geralt simultaneously observed national disability adverts, as they left him with an inexplicable rage. After his preparation was complete, Geralt consumed a vial of LSD, bearing tinges of methamphetamine and wade his way into the castle. The initial threat that Geralt encountered was at the hands of a busty, smirking and chipper female, who was situated at the front desk. The female, upon sighting Geralt, began grinning manically, exclaiming, “Hi there, my name is Caroline, how may I help you today?” Geralt, could not believe it, this female was attempting to seduce him, he could envision it plain in her eyes, her desire to bear his offspring was ever present. Fortunately, prior to entering the facility he had warded himself from all incantations and trickery and as such saw through her ploy. The female, sensing Geralts reluctance to answer, jubilantly stated, “Hi there, are you aware that this you are in the disability support partners facility?” These words, thank the dear heavens, were the last that she ever uttered, as Geralt, desiring to elude being captivated by the seductress, hurled a shrapnel grenade at her head, likely slaughtering her instantly. Then, withdrawing a sword and raising aloft a Polish flag, he began his ascent into the hagravens fortress that Steven Dawson called home. \n\nMany of the harlots were slaughtered before Geralt encountered his prey. The man, Steven Dawson, was in the midst of serenading to a photograph of a blonde female. The ballad appeared self improvise, as it bore numerous raunchy lyrics and his personal depraved sexual fantasies. Geralt, being unable to endure the sirens wail for a moment more, crept up behind the bellower and promptly caved in his skull with the matter, whilst piercing his chest with a blade. Thus, the contract of the bellower was completed, with Geralt returning to his contractor with the head as evidence of the deed. Afterwards, Geralt’s reputation in the eyes of the world irrevocably altered. Many perceived him as a hero, shielding civilization from the handicapped, whilst more insidious, clandestine groups, such as the NDSP and the UNESCO vilified Geralt, condemning him on his history of virtuous acts. As such, in completing this contract, Geralt had invoked the rage of various sinister groups. Frequently, Geralt throughout roaming in various realms, such as Temeria, Novigrad and the sort was hounded by priests sent by the Catholic Church, security forces, spokespersons for the United Nations and most mobs of depraved fiends who preached about human rights. In typical Geralt fashion he slaughtered them all, whilst locating their families to seduce and copulate with.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the plot of the Witcher 3 and have immensely enjoyed slaughtering those who are inept at tying their own shoelaces, let along being able to cognitively contemplate. Furthermore, I appreciate the games symbolism by masquerading the handicapped as fearsome abominations, bearing horns, leathery skin, bristling aggression and solely conversing in guttural howls, as it wholly depicts the fact that the handicapped are not genuinely human, but are merely abominations that perpetually teeter along the edge of insanity. In summary, Witcher 3 is a grand game and I endear all onlookers to engage upon it immediately, lest you wish to never engage in your deep rooted, primalistic desires to assault the disabled.

While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn\'t the games, its you. ""Its not that games aren\'t fun anymore, you have gotten older"".\n\nAnd then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can\'t wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist\' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....""Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?"" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who\'s dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven\'t felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3.

The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""Witcher 3 TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven\'t done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That\'s how beautiful this Open World this.

(in my opinion)', ""Words can simply not describe how much I love this game, but will certainly do my best:\n\nCharacters - Existing characters such as Geralt, Triss, Ciri, Dandelion, Yen, Keira (plus Shani and Regis for the expansions) have been utilized brilliantly from the source material and used so well in the world the game has created, and boy what a world it is! The characters I previously mentioned are probably the ones that stood out for me the most, but to be honest there are so many brilliantly constructed characters (even minor ones like Bart the Rock Troll) that I simply don't know where to even begin... Geralt's interaction with most them is simply brilliant, and the game has so many amazing, memorable moments because of it (including the famous 'drinking game segment' at Kaer Morgen). You also get a logged back story for each character, most of it taken from the books and/or previous games. which is brilliant if, like me, you decided to read the books afterwards or couldn't be bothered playing through the first couple of Witcher games (although I did get through 3 stages of the original game). It's obviously more important to have this as there is alot of stuff in the game that needs back story to elaborate on, weither it be a situation or certain dialogue. Oh yes the dialogue, love love love some of conversations in this game. You can tell alot of thought and effort went into it. The character dialogue for the most part, particularly for Geralt is so complex and funny. As it is with certain other characters mind you, but Geralt's obviously stands out the most\n\nEnvironment - The graphics and art design for all the environments are simply brilliant, each location had its own distinctive feel and is and absolute joy to explore (I spent about 2 weeks just exploring Skellege's oceans and vast landscapes)\n\nMonsters/Enemies - Such a huge assorted variety, honestly you can never get bored with the variety of enemies you face. I also love that each monster has it's own unique methods of quickly being dispelled, and everytime you discover something a description will pop up in the beast log, breaking up everything into different categories aswell\n\nStory - Soooo gooood. Honestly story elements wise, I don't think any game is going to even come remotely close. Especially given that so many of the side stories actually match, and even sometimes exceed, the complexity and epicness of the main storyline\n\nCombat - Kept interesting through the graphic, stylized fighting and dismemberment. Aswell as the additional use of things like signs and potions. Once again you usually need to use certain combinations of things to kill my monsters more easily, particularly the more defined 'boss level' ones\n\nExpansions - BRILLIANT. Hearts of Stone has truely amazing story and character elements. While Blood and Wine does this on a slightly lower scale but adds another beautiful environment with various new enemies to face\n\nSo basically this the best I can do to some up how epic The Witcher 3 is. But honestly, just play the damn game!!!\n\nMy Rating for this game - 10/10"", ""I don't know how to describe this experience. My steam adventure started with The Witcher: Enhanced Edition game, which allowed me to open a steam account. As a console player, I didn't think I would be a computer player, but the witcher series also made me love computer controls.Also, i played the first two games with computer controls, it was fun, but witcher 3 was a game that made me buy a gamepad.The first two games really felt like I was in the game with their open worlds and quality stories. You know, there are some special games that you feel empty when finished. I guess that's how I feel right now. I tried to explore every part of the world and do side quests as much as I could, but I still couldn't get enough of it. This game is a masterpiece for me as an open world and story. There are missions that balance the border between funny and seriousness very well. It is a game that I started late but never tired of playing. I guess it's like a game series that I will play again and again after a certain time. At least it's worth seeing Geralt again ^^"", 'What is the premise of life and how is it intertwined with destiny? Some believe that their existence is to perform grand deeds, whilst others contentedly was little girls in basins, an occupation that I earnestly desire. Geralt was one of these men who had a destiny, a goal to slaughter the mentally handicapped, whilst venturing off to pollinate with their caregivers. His aim and dedication in slaughtering the mentally deficient earnt him the ire of various human rights committees who dubbed him the White Wolf, a name inspired by his peculiar habits of skinning his prey alive, to then don them as a cloak. Geralt’s work was so effective that many, from a petulant child, to a mother, fatigued with cleaning out her handicapped child’s waste, and having to spoon fed him intangible jellies as sustenance, frequently contracted the White Wolf to slaughter whatever mouth drivelling, rabid imbecile was assigned. Often the contractors that hired Geralt to slaughter the handicapped were families, or a fuming neighbour, disgruntled over being nightly woken by a mentally handicapped banshee, slamming together two frying pans at the stroke of midnight, whilst serenading an incoherent, intelligible tune. On other occasions he was assigned high profile contracts, most prominently of them all, was the bellower of Castle Whistlewood, a contract he was issues by an individual who wishes to remain anonymous. \n\nThe bellower of Castle Whislewood, otherwise regarded as Steven Dawson, was a distant relative of Austin Powers and was generally emotionally volatile, mentally decrepit simpleton with Tourette’s and Autism.

Both are 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn\'t beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don\'t fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn\'t be where I am today.

Both are 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn\'t beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don\'t fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn\'t be where I am today.

ARK: Survival Evolved,Adventure,346110,"[""Ark - Its hard to describe. \n\nIs it fun. Yep, if your doing your own server your going to really enjoy it. \n\nIf your on official servers PVE.  The servers tend to accumulate a 10/1 Chineese to Other player base.  They will make massive structures and put out max dino's most the time.  This will cause some servers to crash so often that the EU/NA players can't even use the servers. \n\nFor example GenOne.  There are servers that are 9000 days where the other servers are now hitting 10000 days in game.  That means 1/10 of the time more probably more the server was rebooting, destroying play time of players, and causing transferred characters to be deleted.   I believe wildcard tried to region restrict the servers a while back but failed to accomplish this simple task.  It actually cause more Chineese to move to NA servers for example, MANY more. \n\nSO worst part of the game, severe lag.  If your unlucky enough to find one where the BOX tribes took over. Its going to be MUCH worse.    \n\nI'll still give the game 4.5/5 but be warned.  Ask before building on a server.  The lag spikes and crashes can be extreme.  Also if the server is 500+ days behind its other near numbered brothers... Its a lagbomb/crasher that probably has some box tribe exploit base built inside a restricted area causing it to crash often as people try to use it.  \n\n5000 hours+ played, it is very fun if you find the right server.   Also pre-Transfer you will really enjoy official servers.  After that though the box tribes will cause havoc as they migrate massive numbers of structures and vaults to the server."", 'dinosaurs poop in this game', ""I desperately want to like this game. On paper, it's everything I could ask for. Dinosaurs and prehistoric beasts! Taming, equipping, feeding them! Going exploring with epic mounts and hunting companions! Gradually building up a base that rivals the grandest of fortresses!\n\nI want to like this game, but it's just too damn buggy. I was able to tolerate it for a while, where it would be frustrating but I could deal. The lost dinosaurs, the clipping, the stupid deaths, the building issues, whatever.\n\nBut then my prized Sarcosuchus ended up instantly dying when I was swimming and happened to brush the shoreline. I was very upset, but I went out and captured another one. Then, about five minutes after taming the new one, the exact same thing happened again.\n\nIt turns out the the Sarcosuchus's natural sprint speed is fast enough that it insta-kills it if it touches the shoreline, because for some reason the sprint speed is converted to fall damage. The solution to this bug? Just don't sprint, or don't use the Sarcosuchus. A known issue since 2018 that far as I know still hasn't been fixed. Just one of many user complaints that have not been addressed, and it was the last straw for me.\n\nThere's so much to like in this game, but the lack of polish just ends up ruining the experience. And it's such a tragedy, because this could really have been my most played game of all time."", 'This is a fun game i love the concept of it and the curve balls they put in this game is really good graphics and is worth buying', 'I still remember the first time I played this game. I started out on a solo server. Had no clue what I was doing since there was no tutorial at the time, and the game was in early stages. Chain died to dilo\'s, raptors. Made a small shit shack out of wood. Huddled in a dark corner in pitch darkness hoping my stuff wasn\'t going to get destroyed by the raptors outside. Fought my way through them by cheesing them using elevation to my advantage. Found my first high lvl dino 120 trike (Max lvl at the time). Took 6 hours to tame with hand picked berries and narcotics to try and keep it down. More raptors kept spawning and trying to get at my trike buddy, but I prevailed. Tamed out only a few levels higher, due to harassment from the raptors. That thing was a beast, ripped through alpha raptors with constant knock back. Killed tons of carnos. Until an alpha rex snuck up on me in pitch darkness and ate my poor buddy. \n\nI thought I was ready for pvp after that experience gained. Spawned on the beach and went for the same spot to build my wood shack. At the time the alpha tribe of the server was pretty close (Server 1) Veras Vanguard. They came with argies and forcefully told me to relocate my shit shack somewhere else. I said NAH! Instantly picked off by the argy and went for a ride of a life time from a cliff to my death. I chucked a few sling shot rocks at their dinos and killed a few of them off. Merely to be a pest in my sorrow because of my base being ruined. \n\nThis was when I realized to make it anywhere in pvp I must join a tribe to survive. At the time I heard Spartans was a big tribe and Barrys Seals. I felt more welcome in Seals, so that\'s where my pvp experience began. Raiding other mega tribes, killing countless dinos and players. That\'s what makes this game great, playing it with other people and creating a community around it.\n\nArk as a game is a rollercoaster ride. You always have your ups and downs. It\'s the best survival game I have ever played. The others don\'t come close to it. The things that make this game so epic is when you think you made it far and can\'t possibly be killed ark will always say ""Hold my beer"" as it proceeds to reap your soul from your body with a carefully planted troodon. Or an underwater scorpion that knocks you out before you could even shit your pants. Or another player sneaking up on you and smacking you over the head with a club. \n\nI started on pvp server and ignored the story completely. From a beach bob to a semi-big tribe to a mega. Each had its stories and community of people. Made some friends, enemies which both lead to epic battles.\n\nThis game has its share of countless bugs, I wish the developers spent more time fixing those before proceeding to create more content and DLC\'s. \n\nAs a whole I would recommend this game to people, but know what kind of player you are. PVP is mostly for people who have a large community and can take turns looking after bases, and mostly ignore the story of the game. PvE is more geared for casual players who don\'t have the time to maintain bases against others and just want to experience the story of the game or RP away with mods.\n\n', ""Note: I play on official (PvE) servers. If you pick up this game I recommend looking for a private server or renting your own. Can be fun and has a lot of potential but I can't give it a positive review for the official server experience- for a game that requires a huge amount of time to be sunk in to progress, it's beyond frustrating that you can lose literally hundreds of hours of work to bugs and random server glitches. GMs will try to be helpful (if they respond at all), but you'll likely be told there is nothing that can be done. Servers are insanely laggy, especially on world-save intervals, and you will likely have multiple crashes and rollbacks a day depending on which server you are on. It's not uncommon for a server to go down for days at a time.\n\nRecently my tribe had half of our cryofridges go dead despite being powered and on the same grid as others that were fine and fully charged, and we lost all the dinos (hundreds in total) in them. Might not be a big deal for larger tribes with more people who can recover more easily, but we are only two people. Losing a fridge full of Gigas we had raised and fully imprinted was a huge bummer, not to mention a bunch of event color dinos that we won't have access to for another year.\n\nBugs like that and many more have been documented for years now and they *still* exist, that's pretty unacceptable given how much of a grind it is to do anything in ARK. I see the appeal in the game, and I might still play casually... but I'm no longer sinking that time and dedication into a game that will only fuck me over in the long run, and I won't be buying ARK 2 unless Wildcard really turn themselves around. Such a shame since it's really a very fun concept, but there are many other open-world survival games out there that are stable and are much more deserving of your time and energy."", 'Oh man, this game is great. Learn to live with lag and frame drops. Do not enable damage numbers unless you hate your PC. Inbreed your favourite dogs to make the best boy dogs. Spend all your day trying to get your dinosaurs organised and have it all destroyed by a fat-fingered tribemate.\n\nBut have you ever seen a baby otter? 5/5 stars.', ""Would you like to play on servers where every single source of metal is blocked by an indestructible metal pillar? Want to lose months of progress because you got bombed overnight? Want to spend every waking hour checking into ARK to make sure your tames didn't get killed, only to eventually realize the game isn't even fun now - it's just work? Do you enjoy constant crashes, gamebreaking bugs, and low fps? ARK is the game for you!\n\nEdit: Looks like Ark is on sale at 10 dollars at the moment. While I don't think ARK is worth the full $50, it's definitely worth it at $10"", 'Remember do not play official server', ""Expectantly disappointing\n\n     It is an mmo after all, much of the experience is derived from the other players of the game and although I have made some friends through playing I don't think I could recommend this game to people for the following criticism: extreme unbalance in public servers. Making dinos transferable is one of the worst decisions made by the ark team and although it is available to be turned off in server settings, many if not all of the official serves do not do so. This doesn't seem like a problem until someone from another server comes in with a end game, max level dino, flattens a whole server and then leaves again in a raid style. For this very reason people flock to dead servers to try to build up then go raid another server and then return to their 'safe' server where they can't be touched.\n\n     In terms of performance, the game runs fine, if resource heavy. Graphics are alright, other than the blinding bloom and sun shafts, which cannot be adjusted to my knowledge other than through the gamma level and can be prevented from being adjusted server-side.\n\n     For play with a group of friends on your own server, I think this game could be perfect, but it is not viable to play with the general public as of this very moment."", ""I'd recommend this game but with some caveats, but we'll get to that.\n\nFirst and foremost: survival game with dinosaurs, multiplayer, base-building and optionally PvP. Heck yes.\nI don't like spoiling things too much, but dinosaurs and animals are a core part of the player's engagement in the game, not just the enemies of the world you have to deal with.\n\nHowever, the game is sometimes extremely rough around the edges.\n\nHaving played this as a dino fan myself and with a dino freak friend, we could look past the issues of jankiness, but it did definitely test my patience at times.\n\nIf you're the type of player who can look past some flaws and stick with a game simply due to the theme or feel appealing to you more than usual, I'd recommend giving this a go.\nIf, on the other hand, polish, quality and user experience are paramount, maybe try this at a deep deep sale or simply do not even pick it up.\n\nIf you do decide to pick it up, ask around for a friend who knows their way around all the different map options and server parameters etc. because those can also very much change your experience, and make or break the game for you!\n\nAs an exemple, the first map I tried out made me want to get a refund, but with some research and setting up, I've had the time of my life in the Ragnarok map.\n\nDinos are cool."", ""[b][i]PROS[/i][/b]\n[i]The game is the best for survival.\u200f\u200f\u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e[/i]\n[i]The game is beautiful and exciting.[/i]\n[i]A lot of additional content.\u200e[/i]\n[b][i]CONS[/i][/b]\n\u200f\u200f[i]A lot of texture problems and bugs.[/i]\n[i]\u200f\u200f\u200eIt's not comfortable to play without mods.[/i]\n\u200f\u200f[i]\u200eA lot of cheaters on the official servers[/i]\n[b];)[/b]\n[spoiler]\u200f\u200f\u200e[b]ARK ONELOVE<3[/b][/spoiler]\n"", 'Toxic community and greedy devs are more concerned with releasing game-breaking DLC than fixing game breaking bugs', 'I thought that this game looked dumb, some half dressed woman ridding on a dino, but, once I had played it for over an hour I knew it was going to be one of my very favorite games of all times.

Made a small shit shack out of wood. Huddled in a dark corner in pitch darkness hoping my stuff wasn\'t going to get destroyed by the raptors outside. Fought my way through them by cheesing them using elevation to my advantage. Found my first high lvl dino 120 trike (Max lvl at the time). Took 6 hours to tame with hand picked berries and narcotics to try and keep it down. More raptors kept spawning and trying to get at my trike buddy, but I prevailed. Tamed out only a few levels higher, due to harassment from the raptors. That thing was a beast, ripped through alpha raptors with constant knock back. Killed tons of carnos. Until an alpha rex snuck up on me in pitch darkness and ate my poor buddy. \n\nI thought I was ready for pvp after that experience gained. Spawned on the beach and went for the same spot to build my wood shack. At the time the alpha tribe of the server was pretty close (Server 1) Veras Vanguard. They came with argies and forcefully told me to relocate my shit shack somewhere else. I said NAH! Instantly picked off by the argy and went for a ride of a life time from a cliff to my death. I chucked a few sling shot rocks at their dinos and killed a few of them off. Merely to be a pest in my sorrow because of my base being ruined. \n\nThis was when I realized to make it anywhere in pvp I must join a tribe to survive. At the time I heard Spartans was a big tribe and Barrys Seals. I felt more welcome in Seals, so that\'s where my pvp experience began. Raiding other mega tribes, killing countless dinos and players. That\'s what makes this game great, playing it with other people and creating a community around it.\n\nArk as a game is a rollercoaster ride. You always have your ups and downs. It\'s the best survival game I have ever played. The others don\'t come close to it. The things that make this game so epic is when you think you made it far and can\'t possibly be killed ark will always say ""Hold my beer"" as it proceeds to reap your soul from your body with a carefully planted troodon. Or an underwater scorpion that knocks you out before you could even shit your pants. Or another player sneaking up on you and smacking you over the head with a club. \n\nI started on pvp server and ignored the story completely. From a beach bob to a semi-big tribe to a mega. Each had its stories and community of people. Made some friends, enemies which both lead to epic battles.\n\nThis game has its share of countless bugs, I wish the developers spent more time fixing those before proceeding to create more content and DLC\'s. \n\nAs a whole I would recommend this game to people, but know what kind of player you are. PVP is mostly for people who have a large community and can take turns looking after bases, and mostly ignore the story of the game. PvE is more geared for casual players who don\'t have the time to maintain bases against others and just want to experience the story of the game or RP away with mods.\n\n', ""Note: I play on official (PvE) servers. If you pick up this game I recommend looking for a private server or renting your own. Can be fun and has a lot of potential but I can't give it a positive review for the official server experience- for a game that requires a huge amount of time to be sunk in to progress, it's beyond frustrating that you can lose literally hundreds of hours of work to bugs and random server glitches. GMs will try to be helpful (if they respond at all), but you'll likely be told there is nothing that can be done. Servers are insanely laggy, especially on world-save intervals, and you will likely have multiple crashes and rollbacks a day depending on which server you are on. It's not uncommon for a server to go down for days at a time.\n\nRecently my tribe had half of our cryofridges go dead despite being powered and on the same grid as others that were fine and fully charged, and we lost all the dinos (hundreds in total) in them. Might not be a big deal for larger tribes with more people who can recover more easily, but we are only two people. Losing a fridge full of Gigas we had raised and fully imprinted was a huge bummer, not to mention a bunch of event color dinos that we won't have access to for another year.\n\nBugs like that and many more have been documented for years now and they *still* exist, that's pretty unacceptable given how much of a grind it is to do anything in ARK. I see the appeal in the game, and I might still play casually... but I'm no longer sinking that time and dedication into a game that will only fuck me over in the long run, and I won't be buying ARK 2 unless Wildcard really turn themselves around. Such a shame since it's really a very fun concept, but there are many other open-world survival games out there that are stable and are much more deserving of your time and energy."", 'Oh man, this game is great. Learn to live with lag and frame drops. Do not enable damage numbers unless you hate your PC. Inbreed your favourite dogs to make the best boy dogs.

Do you enjoy constant crashes, gamebreaking bugs, and low fps? ARK is the game for you!\n\nEdit: Looks like Ark is on sale at 10 dollars at the moment. While I don't think ARK is worth the full $50, it's definitely worth it at $10"", 'Remember do not play official server', ""Expectantly disappointing\n\n     It is an mmo after all, much of the experience is derived from the other players of the game and although I have made some friends through playing I don't think I could recommend this game to people for the following criticism: extreme unbalance in public servers. Making dinos transferable is one of the worst decisions made by the ark team and although it is available to be turned off in server settings, many if not all of the official serves do not do so. This doesn't seem like a problem until someone from another server comes in with a end game, max level dino, flattens a whole server and then leaves again in a raid style. For this very reason people flock to dead servers to try to build up then go raid another server and then return to their 'safe' server where they can't be touched.\n\n     In terms of performance, the game runs fine, if resource heavy. Graphics are alright, other than the blinding bloom and sun shafts, which cannot be adjusted to my knowledge other than through the gamma level and can be prevented from being adjusted server-side.\n\n     For play with a group of friends on your own server, I think this game could be perfect, but it is not viable to play with the general public as of this very moment."", ""I'd recommend this game but with some caveats, but we'll get to that.\n\nFirst and foremost: survival game with dinosaurs, multiplayer, base-building and optionally PvP.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Adventure,1174180,"['I think this game deserves a rightful deep insight because its no easy task after being overloaded by it. The importance of it nowadays, the example it sets for gaming and why you should reserve this game a special place so you don\'t miss all the fun.\n\n[code] 𝐈𝐓 𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐏𝐄𝐂𝐓𝐒 𝐘𝐎𝐔 𝐀𝐒 𝐀 𝐆𝐀𝐌𝐄𝐑 𝐑𝐀𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐑 𝐓𝐇𝐀𝐍 𝐉𝐔𝐒𝐓 𝐀 𝐂𝐔𝐒𝐓𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐑 [/code]\n\nI can see how one influences another, but the story mode isn\'t harmed so Online can exist, you’re not going to be harassed by any micro transactions while on singleplayer. The Online is just a choice by definition, you even have the option to turn off friend’s invites. There will be no propaganda of other games in the menu either, like Ubisoft and Capcom usually do. There is no immersion breaking items demanding you to PRETEND they aren\'t there.\n\nI was afraid of buying this because I was skeptical that a game could be better than RDR1 with John Marston. I also avoided it due the highly inflated price in my country (bolsonaro vai tomar no cú). The current sellout discount this month was my best chance. This game is a perfected RDR1 if such witchery is even possible.\n\n\n[h1]𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐁𝐄𝐒𝐓 𝐎𝐅 𝐈𝐌𝐌𝐄𝐑𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍 - 𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐋𝐃\'𝐒 𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐒𝐓[/h1]\n\nIf you’re not an immersive gamer, you’ll learn to be. There are a lot of gameplay mechanics to suit every gamer but they’re so intuitive and sophisticated, it tends to incentivize you to adjust to a survival hybrid. You can be the good-bad guy (the canon R* expects from you), be a chill Boomhauer or just be the bad-bad guy. Sneak, bomb, kill, hunt, whatever you wish or if chaos suits you, even the smallest of things got a lot to show as you have probably heard already.\n\nNow while the Online game preserves some of it, surely isn\'t the same direction. You can fully customize a character but he/she lacks voice for logical reasons, thus no substance (it has story progression) but things are much less dense & less interesting for me. Not my thing to wait for unpredictable randoms, but fun-guarantee with known friends. Again, it is a different driving force in there that requires a mood I don\'t always have.\n\nWhen it comes to feelings however, assuming you were convinced to accept the story\'s pace, you\'ll have time to feel incredible moments and to see beautiful places, especially with decent graphics. Not everything will depend on it though, only a few games can break the boundary between here and “there” merely by some flow. The adverb stands for “where and when” the game is taking place but also ""how"".\n\n[code] 𝐊𝐄𝐘 𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐃: 𝐓𝐑𝐈𝐁𝐀𝐋 [/code]\n\nMany tribes consider wolves to be related to humans, because of the wolf’s dedication to its pack. Loneliness can trigger immersion, sometimes it is the world or the time period, sometimes it\'s everything combined. RDR2 story mode has all that, but it also adds bounding. A gang can trigger unique immersion, until the point of feeling at home, then you know the writer was inspired, voice and body actors were on fire and the development team resonated. As important as “your people” are, so must be “your foe”, giving reasons and further tightening that bounding.\n\nThis isn’t my first time feeling it. Comradery is also in many other games like Mass Effect, Republic Commando, FC Primal, even Lost and Damned and Cyberpunk nomads living in my soul. But it is definitely the first time I feel it in my blood.\n\nIf you wish to get high with such sweet endorphins, you can start by dealing with what you don\'t believe. Like killing, brawling or robbing imprudently (you will do that a lot) or fall to redemption. Of course I despise gangsters but I can see why they can\'t fit in. So, it is easy to find spatial immersion, but easy to get it busted too. Someone may storm your room, maybe your neighbor is a noisy ass messing with your focus or perhaps your cat is very sick today. Until they’re gone or if you go fix them, and of course, you must pay attention to the story 😂 If you think immersion is for crazies, here’s what [b]J.R.R. Tolkien[/b] once said about the importance of suspension of disbelief;\n\n[i]""[The author] makes a secondary world which your mind can enter. Inside it, what he relates is true: it accords with the laws of that world. You therefore believe it, while you are, as it were inside. The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather art, has failed. You are then out in the primary world again, looking at the little abortive secondary world from outside.""[/i]\n\nIf you think Tolkien was crazy at least you’d respect him more than you respect me.\n\n[h1]𝐖𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐄 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐑𝐎𝐂𝐊𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐑 𝐒𝐎𝐏𝐇𝐈𝐒𝐓𝐈𝐂𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐈𝐒[/h1]\n\n[olist][*]Options are as complete as GTA V, you can tweak a lot of things from controllers to color blind. Every game should give you these options specially for keyboard gamers to adjust.\n\n[*]After GTA V for PC, the first person perspective became a regular option as the third person still is the default one. That\'s the quality bar Rockstar has set.\n\n[*]If you’re investing in new hardware, your sacrifices will be really worthy. I usually criticize R* porting to PC, even if you still can’t peak 60 fps you’re going to blow away anyway.\n\n[*]All the galloping and walking physics & animations are so incredibly realistic on snow, slopes and et cætera they tend to glitch when you take it too hard. If you are unpredictable, take it easy.\n\n[*]My nerd senses indicate a hundred scripts are running in the background, one of the reasons why I prefer story mode. When I first had a lucky hunt, the camp was visibly happier, more active. I don’t know what black sorcery stabilizes it, for it is polished enough to stand most of it.\n\n[*]The musicians did a phenomenal job transferring non-gaming culture. My jaw is always dropping, but the first action music that played crashed into outdated mufflers as if I was watching Bonanza or something, shockingly good.\n\n[*]Detail is a self-interacting multi-cell organism without precedents. From animals eyes reflecting light, to fruits falling from trees. NPCs even save reactions for later, I saw 19th century brats in the alleys, dogs trying to dig under the fence. This is what an historian artist can do when he has the $ dinero.\n\n[*]Here’s hoping RDR1 will be remastered for PC one day and a solo game with Black Belle, cowgirls are badasses too. We like action and westerns are the best. More time passes, the more it stays the same.[/olist]\n\n[code] 𝐖𝐇𝐄𝐍 𝐘𝐎𝐔 𝐆𝐎𝐓 𝐍𝐎𝐓𝐇𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐁𝐀𝐃 𝐓𝐎 𝐒𝐀𝐘 𝐁𝐔𝐓 𝐘𝐎𝐔 𝐌𝐔𝐒𝐓 [/code]\n\nI like to criticize and I finally managed to nitpick irrelevant things no one gives a xith about, but may be visible to vagabonds, so here I come;\n\n[olist][*]I wanted to rate this game as my first 10/10 but not after ERR_GFX_STATE issues. Took me a lot to fix, R* had plenty of time to stabilize Vulkan\'s and R* Social Club bugs and its overlay conflicts. As for ultrawide screens, no mod to remove black bars is reliable (including from photo mode). I tried to fix it but it\'s too risky to mess with protected games.\n\n[*]The brain takes some time to hardwire all the contextual actions, they can be confusing. Stop exposing your guns when you try to speak or punching the horse when you just want to pat.\n\n[*]I think that saving and loading the game should be more intuitive as the game itself. When you do mistakes you’d regret for the first time, it isn\'t very clear how to roll back.

It\'s simply too shallow comparing to singleplayer. In general your gameplay in RDO consists of two things - missions and competitive sessions like deathmatch or races. Even so caled ""roles"" are basically sets of different missions, some of them are nice and interesting, most of them are your typical fetch-kill quests. RDO also has story missions, they are kinda okay, but nothing special either. What\'s really bad about RDO - its people, who are playing it, since in 90% of player interactions you will be one-shot instantly from a sniper rifle long before you actually see who did this.

The importance of it nowadays, the example it sets for gaming and why you should reserve this game a special place so you don\'t miss all the fun.\n\n[code] 𝐈𝐓 𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐏𝐄𝐂𝐓𝐒 𝐘𝐎𝐔 𝐀𝐒 𝐀 𝐆𝐀𝐌𝐄𝐑 𝐑𝐀𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐑 𝐓𝐇𝐀𝐍 𝐉𝐔𝐒𝐓 𝐀 𝐂𝐔𝐒𝐓𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐑 [/code]\n\nI can see how one influences another, but the story mode isn\'t harmed so Online can exist, you’re not going to be harassed by any micro transactions while on singleplayer. The Online is just a choice by definition, you even have the option to turn off friend’s invites. There will be no propaganda of other games in the menu either, like Ubisoft and Capcom usually do. There is no immersion breaking items demanding you to PRETEND they aren\'t there.\n\nI was afraid of buying this because I was skeptical that a game could be better than RDR1 with John Marston. I also avoided it due the highly inflated price in my country (bolsonaro vai tomar no cú). The current sellout discount this month was my best chance. This game is a perfected RDR1 if such witchery is even possible.\n\n\n[h1]𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐁𝐄𝐒𝐓 𝐎𝐅 𝐈𝐌𝐌𝐄𝐑𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍 - 𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐋𝐃\'𝐒 𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐒𝐓[/h1]\n\nIf you’re not an immersive gamer, you’ll learn to be. There are a lot of gameplay mechanics to suit every gamer but they’re so intuitive and sophisticated, it tends to incentivize you to adjust to a survival hybrid. You can be the good-bad guy (the canon R* expects from you), be a chill Boomhauer or just be the bad-bad guy. Sneak, bomb, kill, hunt, whatever you wish or if chaos suits you, even the smallest of things got a lot to show as you have probably heard already.\n\nNow while the Online game preserves some of it, surely isn\'t the same direction. You can fully customize a character but he/she lacks voice for logical reasons, thus no substance (it has story progression) but things are much less dense & less interesting for me. Not my thing to wait for unpredictable randoms, but fun-guarantee with known friends. Again, it is a different driving force in there that requires a mood I don\'t always have.\n\nWhen it comes to feelings however, assuming you were convinced to accept the story\'s pace, you\'ll have time to feel incredible moments and to see beautiful places, especially with decent graphics. Not everything will depend on it though, only a few games can break the boundary between here and “there” merely by some flow. The adverb stands for “where and when” the game is taking place but also ""how"".\n\n[code] 𝐊𝐄𝐘 𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐃: 𝐓𝐑𝐈𝐁𝐀𝐋 [/code]\n\nMany tribes consider wolves to be related to humans, because of the wolf’s dedication to its pack. Loneliness can trigger immersion, sometimes it is the world or the time period, sometimes it\'s everything combined. RDR2 story mode has all that, but it also adds bounding. A gang can trigger unique immersion, until the point of feeling at home, then you know the writer was inspired, voice and body actors were on fire and the development team resonated. As important as “your people” are, so must be “your foe”, giving reasons and further tightening that bounding.\n\nThis isn’t my first time feeling it. Comradery is also in many other games like Mass Effect, Republic Commando, FC Primal, even Lost and Damned and Cyberpunk nomads living in my soul. But it is definitely the first time I feel it in my blood.\n\nIf you wish to get high with such sweet endorphins, you can start by dealing with what you don\'t believe. Like killing, brawling or robbing imprudently (you will do that a lot) or fall to redemption. Of course I despise gangsters but I can see why they can\'t fit in. So, it is easy to find spatial immersion, but easy to get it busted too. Someone may storm your room, maybe your neighbor is a noisy ass messing with your focus or perhaps your cat is very sick today. Until they’re gone or if you go fix them, and of course, you must pay attention to the story 😂 If you think immersion is for crazies, here’s what [b]J.R.R. Tolkien[/b] once said about the importance of suspension of disbelief;\n\n[i]""[The author] makes a secondary world which your mind can enter. Inside it, what he relates is true: it accords with the laws of that world. You therefore believe it, while you are, as it were inside. The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather art, has failed. You are then out in the primary world again, looking at the little abortive secondary world from outside.""[/i]\n\nIf you think Tolkien was crazy at least you’d respect him more than you respect me.\n\n[h1]𝐖𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐄 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐑𝐎𝐂𝐊𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐑 𝐒𝐎𝐏𝐇𝐈𝐒𝐓𝐈𝐂𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐈𝐒[/h1]\n\n[olist][*]Options are as complete as GTA V, you can tweak a lot of things from controllers to color blind. Every game should give you these options specially for keyboard gamers to adjust.\n\n[*]After GTA V for PC, the first person perspective became a regular option as the third person still is the default one. That\'s the quality bar Rockstar has set.\n\n[*]If you’re investing in new hardware, your sacrifices will be really worthy. I usually criticize R* porting to PC, even if you still can’t peak 60 fps you’re going to blow away anyway.\n\n[*]All the galloping and walking physics & animations are so incredibly realistic on snow, slopes and et cætera they tend to glitch when you take it too hard. If you are unpredictable, take it easy.\n\n[*]My nerd senses indicate a hundred scripts are running in the background, one of the reasons why I prefer story mode. When I first had a lucky hunt, the camp was visibly happier, more active. I don’t know what black sorcery stabilizes it, for it is polished enough to stand most of it.\n\n[*]The musicians did a phenomenal job transferring non-gaming culture. My jaw is always dropping, but the first action music that played crashed into outdated mufflers as if I was watching Bonanza or something, shockingly good.\n\n[*]Detail is a self-interacting multi-cell organism without precedents. From animals eyes reflecting light, to fruits falling from trees. NPCs even save reactions for later, I saw 19th century brats in the alleys, dogs trying to dig under the fence. This is what an historian artist can do when he has the $ dinero.\n\n[*]Here’s hoping RDR1 will be remastered for PC one day and a solo game with Black Belle, cowgirls are badasses too. We like action and westerns are the best. More time passes, the more it stays the same.[/olist]\n\n[code] 𝐖𝐇𝐄𝐍 𝐘𝐎𝐔 𝐆𝐎𝐓 𝐍𝐎𝐓𝐇𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐁𝐀𝐃 𝐓𝐎 𝐒𝐀𝐘 𝐁𝐔𝐓 𝐘𝐎𝐔 𝐌𝐔𝐒𝐓 [/code]\n\nI like to criticize and I finally managed to nitpick irrelevant things no one gives a xith about, but may be visible to vagabonds, so here I come;\n\n[olist][*]I wanted to rate this game as my first 10/10 but not after ERR_GFX_STATE issues. Took me a lot to fix, R* had plenty of time to stabilize Vulkan\'s and R* Social Club bugs and its overlay conflicts. As for ultrawide screens, no mod to remove black bars is reliable (including from photo mode). I tried to fix it but it\'s too risky to mess with protected games.\n\n[*]The brain takes some time to hardwire all the contextual actions, they can be confusing. Stop exposing your guns when you try to speak or punching the horse when you just want to pat.\n\n[*]I think that saving and loading the game should be more intuitive as the game itself. When you do mistakes you’d regret for the first time, it isn\'t very clear how to roll back. One would think that sleeping acts as manual save, but you can only do so by the pause menu.[/olist]\n\n[h1]𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐀𝐋 𝐒𝐂𝐎𝐑𝐄 𝟗.𝟓/𝟏𝟎[/h1]\n\nIf you liked this review, please follow me [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/27184480/][b]at my curator\'s page[/b] if you wish![/url]\n\nNow a special words to developers; shouldn’t you start doing it like R* does?

Slowly you begin to form your own biases and conclusions for each character as Arthur interacts with them.\n\nYou make decisions that will impact how everyone sees you and how everyone will treat you. Though I would have wanted to explore that a bit more, your decisions are gonna be influenced by the karma meter. I would have liked to be able to stay right in the middle,\nlike a grey moral area between good cowboy and bad cowboy but oh well.\n\nThe graphics are amazing, let\'s just get that out of the way. It looks great, the weather system is a little fast sometimes but not too jarring. The biomes that simulate the arid areas, the cold areas and the more temperate areas are superbly done. I especially hate the swamp lands cause it gives me that gross humid feeling and it is frankly pretty great since its able to make me feel that way.\n\nClothing options aplenty but with some limitations. Truly the endgame is to be able to dress up in many different outfits and be able to put on different looks whenever the mood strikes you. There\'s a decent amount of clothes you can layer but sometimes the physics kind of bug out. This part specifically for the online version cause the tail coats have a bug that give your character some ""extra cake"". \n\nThere is a good selection of playable guns and I love the fact that you can customize them as well.

If you\'re struggling to make it past the first bit, I urge you to trudge along and at least give it a fair chance. It gets a lot more fun, trust me. \n\nOh the free roaming is great. You can ignore the storyline completely so that you can just ride around RP-ing as a cowboy or whatever you wanna do. Standard rockstar open world but no cars, only horses.\n\nThe best part that I like about RDR2 is the hunting.\nYou can just chill out and instead of doing the usual thing where you shoot people,\nyou can just go hunting instead, stalk your prey, strike and skin \'em. Make \'em into clothes \'n stuff.\n\nGo fishing, catch some good eats.

One of if not the most immersive game worlds ever created, though it is a very slow game because its almost like being there in the old west for real. Some may like that, others may love the immersion.\n\nIt has some of the most realistic NPCs with actual AI that works, which seems rare for games of today. You can even talk to every NPC and there is a lot of interaction.\n\nIt also has, while small considering its the old west, the most immersive towns and ""cities"" (for the time period) ever created in a game. The towns are amazing, and never have I seen such amazing detail with so much interaction, realism and actual npcs that look like they belong there in towns/cities that know how to move out of your way than I have this game.\n\nDefinitely highly recommended if you are looking for a highly immersive, slow paced game, where you can actually feel like you are really living in the old west.', ""Even though the game has been out for awhile, I held off on buying it as I was not interested at initial release.\nI finally decided to take a real long look at the game, game play and reviews out there. Those pushed me over the edge and I now have RDR2 in my Library.\n\nLet me start by saying the game still costs a premium price for as long as it has been out. That might scare some off who have tight budgets. However, for me, it is one of those games that is still worth the cost.\n\nYou are not going to finish this game quickly and feel like it cost #20.oo a day to finish a game in 3 days, something I have experienced too often.  This thing takes some time, and it is time well spent. \nThe story is rich and engaging. I find the main character, Arthur Morgan, to be fascinating and entertaining as I play along. He draws you in to the game, a game rich in story.\nNow the graphics, well, they are beautiful. With my RTX 3080 from Asus, I am running this game fulling Optimized through G-force Experience and still get over 100 fps at 1440p. \n\nReplay value on this game will be great too. I can see me playing it several times over, changing outcomes along the way by my actions just to see what happens. Now I don't feel bad about the price at all!\n\nLooking for a game rich in story, long playing with great replay value, excellent graphics, entertaining as all get out? Here it is...................... you're welcome! :-)"", 'THIS IS A GOOD LOOKING GAME', ""First i have to start by saying that this game is a masterpiece. This is the first game i have taken 100 screenshots in the first 10 hours of the game. \nPlaying as Arthur was the best thing in a game because he is one of the best protagonist i have played as.\nThe animations and the voice actors just fit so good one with each other. This is the first game in a long time that made me do every possible mission. The side quests are so well done. Some of them change some things in the story mode.\n\n Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel of the first Red Dead Redemption and it's a good this cause we finally saw what happened to the gang that John was in. And now a lot of things make more sense in the first one.\nRed Dead Online it's a prequel of a prequel, it's really weird. Online it's not bad, but it's hard for new players to make the gold and money. And it needs some heists/robberies but other then that it's good.\n\nThe graphics and visuals of the game are astonishing and really well made.\nThe gameplay it's just so good like no other game.\nThe soundtrack just amazing and really well fitted. A really great choice with the western like vibe of the music and game.\n\nI fell in love with the game in the first 2 hours of it because it's just so good.\n I played like 10-12 hours per day cause it's great. No game really made me do that.  That's how much i love it. I don't regret buying this game. I bought it on sale for 40 euros. The best decision. The game is worth every penny you have. I hope they will port Red Dead Redemption to pc so i can play it or maybe a remake or remastered version of it and maybe Undead Nightmare 1&2.\nSo if you have the money buy the game it's worth it.\nIf you want to look at the screenshots that i have, some are spoilers so be carefull."", 'long and nice story', 'Thumbs up, but sucks that the game only offers perks to morally good choices. I want to be evil.', ""happy but sad, can't explain my pain"", 'So, RDR2 consists of two modes, Story and Online.\n\n[b]Story[/b] - is simply incredible. Not only it features a solid and really dramatic plotline, the amount of details in this game is beyond any comparison. From your first hours in this game you will literally FEEL much love and dedication devs have put in it. Lots of stuff to do, explore and complete. It\'s interesting, it\'s enjoyable, its fun. Overall - really deep and really entertaining, very much recommending it, worth it\'s full price without any doubt.\n\n[b]Online[/b] - well, now it becames problematic. It\'s simply too shallow comparing to singleplayer. In general your gameplay in RDO consists of two things - missions and competitive sessions like deathmatch or races. Even so caled ""roles"" are basically sets of different missions, some of them are nice and interesting, most of them are your typical fetch-kill quests. RDO also has story missions, they are kinda okay, but nothing special either. What\'s really bad about RDO - its people, who are playing it, since in 90% of player interactions you will be one-shot instantly from a sniper rifle long before you actually see who did this. Which in turn forces even the peaceful players to behave the same and kill first to avoid being killed. Game is full of griefers and cheaters, Rockstar doesn\'t give a single about them, as they never did in GTA:O. Thus the same ""pull the plug"" countermeasures which worked in GTA:O are working (and recommended) here too. It\'s also filled with minor, but extremely annoying bugs, the game is really unstable at times. In general - it\'s playable, sometimes enjoyable but lacks any memorable moments apart from really toxic ones which you won\'t be really happy to remember at all.\n\nThus, as friendly advice - don\'t buy standalone RDO, just buy this full version for it\'s Story mode in mind and you\'ll be good.', 'I first played this game on Xbox 4-5 months ago, and I can honestly say that this is the best game that I\'ve ever played, and probably always will be.

We wanted to enjoy the game, not constantly participate in some waterbased pvp-arena, in which one is forced to compete because of nonexisting pve-guidelines, therefore the perfect hunting grounds for toxic-pvp players. While merely learning the basics, we have been killed countless times and had to learn many things from youtube, because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to play the game at all. \n\n@developers: I understand, that it's an important aspect in a pirate game to be able to freely murder and pillage, but why are there no safezones, at least where the traders are (almost every multiplayerbased game with pvp-elements has those or npc-guarded zones)? Please reconsider including more pve-friendly mechanics, maybe a pirates codex with rules, which are not optional to a certain degree or maybe an npc-based menace like the royal navy, where playergroups can join in a pirate alliance to take on npc-vessels. The game has a lot of potencial, sadly not so much for atmosphere-loving pve players.

The game is beautiful and you can have fun by yourself, however there is some bad stuff.\n\nBad Stuff - This is stuff that has happened to me more than once, so buyer beware:\nYou can easily end getting chased for an hour by a toxic group shouting obscenities that just wants to sink you and then hunt you down again and again which really can take the fun out of the game.  If you run a large boat by yourself a group of 2-3 people can join you, put you in the brig and sink your ship out of nowhere.  I've also had players who joined just randomly start throwing treasure you've gathered off the side of the boat while at full sail or try to burn down your ship by cooking a banana.  \n\nThe late game is difficult due to 3 hours spent grinding quests to get a chest for little to no reputation.  And if you're running the faction's flag (which gets you more reputation for turning in faction's treasure), players will attempt to hide on your boat to steal it from you.  I also found out that there is a PC cheat that does aimbot and can find ships / loot within a distance that you can't see normally. So a few of those times where a ship came out of nowhere at the end of my run when I had a lot of loot and sank me, I felt it might have happened due to that cheat.\n\nBut all in all I had a lot of fun playing the game.

We wanted to enjoy the game, not constantly participate in some waterbased pvp-arena, in which one is forced to compete because of nonexisting pve-guidelines, therefore the perfect hunting grounds for toxic-pvp players. While merely learning the basics, we have been killed countless times and had to learn many things from youtube, because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to play the game at all. \n\n@developers: I understand, that it's an important aspect in a pirate game to be able to freely murder and pillage, but why are there no safezones, at least where the traders are (almost every multiplayerbased game with pvp-elements has those or npc-guarded zones)? Please reconsider including more pve-friendly mechanics, maybe a pirates codex with rules, which are not optional to a certain degree or maybe an npc-based menace like the royal navy, where playergroups can join in a pirate alliance to take on npc-vessels.

If you run a large boat by yourself a group of 2-3 people can join you, put you in the brig and sink your ship out of nowhere.  I've also had players who joined just randomly start throwing treasure you've gathered off the side of the boat while at full sail or try to burn down your ship by cooking a banana.  \n\nThe late game is difficult due to 3 hours spent grinding quests to get a chest for little to no reputation.  And if you're running the faction's flag (which gets you more reputation for turning in faction's treasure), players will attempt to hide on your boat to steal it from you.  I also found out that there is a PC cheat that does aimbot and can find ships / loot within a distance that you can't see normally. So a few of those times where a ship came out of nowhere at the end of my run when I had a lot of loot and sank me, I felt it might have happened due to that cheat.\n\nBut all in all I had a lot of fun playing the game.

Using iron sights on weapons requires you to use one eye, just as you would in real life. Manually having to eject a handgun magazine, grab a new one from your backpack, slam it into the gun, then chamber a round is incredibly fun and satisfying. Reloading in itself is a task that requires mastering, and never gets old. This creates a lot of tense moments of fun, such as being grabbed by a barnacle, only to realize you had two bullets left in the magazine and now need to panic reload. I dropped multiple magazines of ammo trying to panic reload in combat, and this only adds to the realism and tension. The shotgun is similar; having to manually chamber shells, then slam the bolt to load. Never gets old. Also, throwing grenades feels extremely intuitive and natural (IF USING THE VALVE INDEX), and objects throw in the way I'd expect them to.

Yakuza: Like a Dragon,Adventure,1235140,"['i wanna eat a peking duck with my dad', 'Everything about it is great. Only downside to this game is that there is no Shun Akiyama.', 'I was expecting not to like this series becoming a jrpg but boy was I wrong', ""I held off on getting this game for a while, I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy the turn based combat instead of the traditional beat em up. I'm glad I bought this game and I wish I had sooner. This has become my favorite of the franchise and one of the best games I've ever played. The story is incredible and filled with brilliantly written and acted characters. \n\nThe protagonist, Ichiban, has quite the boots to fill now that we're not playing as Kiryu anymore. Ichiban is an amazing protagonist and without question does Kiryu justice. The emotional range is wider, and the positive outlook on everything that Ichiban invigorates sets him apart from Kiryu. They're both masterpieces of character development, writing and acting. \n\nThe gameplay is incredibly fun and addicting. Leveling up your character as well as the Job you have set at any given time. Jobs are essentially specializations that incorporate different roles like healing, magic/melee, or even tanking. There's tons of loot, materials for crafting gear, and an enormous variety of enemy designs. Since the game has taken this turn into JRPG territory it's allowed more traditional aspects of other RPGs. There's dungeons, tons of bosses and minibosses, an endgame activity that's very difficult, and more. There's well over 100 hours worth of content here and it all improves you and your party's abilities. \n\nMy complaints are negligible, there's sometimes too many enemies on the streets. That's pretty much it, Yakuza Like A Dragon is near perfect and a must play for anyone who's played the previous games and for anyone who wants to jump for the first time into this universe. Playing the previous games isn't necessary."", ""Unironically one of the best games i've played so far"", 'Right, where do I start...\n\nYakuza: Like a Dragon (later in this review Yakuza 7) has been my introduction to the Yakuza franchise as a whole. Prior to this, all I knew about was the Bakamitai meme, which I also only knew as the Dame Da Ne song. I was a bit sceptical about getting into it at first, as I knew absolutely nothing about the game and franchise as a whole, and Brawlers weren\'t really my thing, but then I heard that this game features a different protagonist, and instead of a Brawler, plays as a turn based RPG. I had some money left over from Christmas, and I\'m a big fan of the old Final Fantasy games, so I thought I might as well give it a try. Could always refund it if I didn\'t enjoy it. \n\nIn Yakuza 7, you play as Ichiban Kasuga, a Yakuza grunt who goes to jail to cover for a higher-ranking member of the Arakawa family, which he belongs to. Thinking that this would make him climb the Yakuza ladder, and that his patriarch will honour and appreciate his cover, he comes back after 18 years of prison time to find out that everybody had abandoned him. Former police officer Koichi Adachi researched about the Tojo Clan and the Arakawa Family, attempts to convince Ichiban to come with him to Yokohama to stay safe, but Ichiban refuses. Ichiban finds his way back to his former patriarch and is then met with an unfortunate fate.\n\nOh boy, I was immediately hooked from the start. ""That\'s a lot of cutscenes for a game, it\'s like I\'m watching a movie"" was my first thought. I liked story heavy games, but I felt a little overwhelmed on my first day, as out of the probably 5 or 6 hours that I was playing, 4 of them were just watching cutscenes. Now this might turn some people down, especially if they just want to enjoy the gameplay, but all the introductory scenes got me more invested in finding out about the presented characters and I didn\'t just want to stop playing until I found a point where I thought ""Okay, now the actual game finally begins.""\n\nThe vast majority of this game takes plays in the streets of Yokohama, more specifically, Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama\'s red light district. The world is incredibly detailed and you\'ll be pleasantly surprised to know that there\'s things hidden in every single corner. I really enjoy exploring in video games, trying to see if there\'s things hidden in places nobody would think of and-- to my surprise, they really thought of everything here. I try sneaking into a corner that I think might not even be intended to go to, and yet, there\'s something there for me to pick up. \n\nI personally went for the ""50% main story, 50% side story"" approach, which to me means - I\'ll do 2 or 3 side quests, of which there are plenty in Yakuza 7, and then I\'ll do a few story quests so that I can keep up with what is happening. And trust me, there\'s a lot of content to burn through. All of the sidequests are very well designed, and most of them got at least a little bit of a chuckle from me, so I\'d like to think that they are quite humorous. Once done with the sidequests, I grabbed my imaginary bucket of popcorn and started getting immersed in the story. \n\nAfter I arrived in Yokohama, and the game properly begun for me, I thought to myself that this would be a silly little hero adventure. One of a redemption arc where Ichiban becomes the hero of a big and epic tale. Well, it\'s kinda like that, it starts off slow and adventurous, but the more the story goes on, Ichiban falls deeper into this crime drama rabbit hole. I will not spoil anything for the sake of letting you enjoy it by yourself, but I can say you\'re in for a treat. A big one. \n\nThe gameplay itself is, as mentioned earlier, a turn based RPG. I hit you, then I wait, then you hit me, and then you wait. Yakuza 7 adds a nice little twist to that by adding small, simple QTEs to most of your abilities. Sometimes you might have to press a button repeatedly to give it more power, sometimes you might need to press the button at the proper time instead. Sometimes even both! It\'s a very, very simple thing but it keeps the combat entertaining, which is the main purpose. All attack animations look nice and polished too, some of the names and descriptions are silly and will put a weird look on your face when you first see it, but all skills feels nice to use. You might not have many skills when you first start the game, but the more you progress, the more and more skills will be added to your arsenal.\n\nThis game works in a job system, which you might be familiar with if you played some Final Fantasy games. While each character has their own primary main job, they can also switch to other jobs, which in this game are gender locked. Male characters can choose from a variety of different jobs, and female characters have their own jobs to choose from, too. Some of these jobs exist for both genders, although slightly altered, such as Host for males and Hostess for females. They essentially do the same thing, yet they slightly differ from one another.\n\nNow, apart from the amazing story that this game has to offer, and the ability to throw ridiculous-looking skills at your enemies, there\'s also plenty of minigames that you can play in this game. Of course, there\'s Karaoke (also with Bakamitai!), Mahjong, Shogi and Dragon Kart (yes, like actual kart racing) just to name a few. Each of these felt well thought out and they\'re fun to do, and you can seriously get invested in them if you\'re dedicated enough. Sometimes I booted this game up just to play a little bit of Mahjong...\n\nBut there\'s probably a few negatives about this game, right? Yes there are, but in my personal opinion, these are just minor things that probably won\'t even bother you unless you think really hard about it. What I disliked during my playthrough is that there\'s just. so. many. random. encounters. I was told by a friend that this is common in the Yakuza games, and that you\'ll have to just deal with it, but god there\'s just so many. Happens a lot that you walk down one street and you get hit with 3 or 4 different encounters that really badly want to murder you. There is an item in this game that completely removes random encounters, but I feel like you\'ll get access to it way too late. By the time you have it, you\'re probably able to finish the game for good already. Another issue that I had in this game is that there was one dungeon that just felt way too long to complete. It wasn\'t even challenging or anything, you just entered a new floor and thought ""this is it"", only to be hit with a wave of disappointment as you realize this is just another floor with the same enemies as the last one. It was a slog to get through it, but luckily it\'s only a one time thing.\n\nSo, what can I say to finalize this review? I think that Yakuza 7 is an amazing game, with a well written and properly thought out story that is guaranteed to keep you glued to your screen, fun and entertaining combat to keep you playing, and a wide variety of different minigames that you grind out, or even just relax with if you feel like. Ichiban and his party makes it feel like you\'re part of the crew, that his achievements and goals are yours too, and that you too can overcome any obstacle if you just believe in yourself and don\'t give up. Ichiban Kasuga has been one of the most relateable characters I have ever met and he\'s found a place in my heart that I will protect. This game has also made me buy all the other main Yakuza games and I\'m motivated to play through all of them, at the time of this review I am currently on Yakuza 4 Remastered. As I found out while playing, there are plenty of references to the older Yakuza games that will make you go ""Oooh, I know this"" when you see them, and they still don\'t feel out of place when you\'re new to it. I am very happy that this game introduced me to the series and I have no shame admitting that I cried when it was over.', ""Heartfelt and great story telling with Final Fantasy/Dragon Quest combat? Awesome!\nNever played a Dragon Quest before this one but I think I'll have to say that it's my favorite one. \nThe story is great and there are so many minigames within that can keep you hooked especially with the wackiness that happens based on the side quests and even the different classes.\n\nCutscenes are super long but aside from that, the story is like a really really long movie."", 'As a Yakuza game, its about what you expect. The game is at times a soap opera, then its grounded in reality and then its goes to some REALLY bizarre and absurd places, and thats just great. Ichiban is NOT Kiryu, we trade super manly ideal super strong dad for a gold hearted goofball badass idiot, and its kind of okay, hes way less of a power fantasy and more of a relatable character thats struggling to make it in life, which at times hits too close to home. As an rpg, its kinda clunky and not too deep, visually its very good. The narrative is what I enjoyed the most from this game, and its pretty good. 8/10, worth your time and money.', '[i]--This [b]will[/b] contain some big spoilers. Don\'t yell at me.--[/i]\n\nThe newest entry into the Yakuza franchise, and RGG\'s first foray into the jRPG genre -- and generally, what a blast this is. It\'s captivated me with every step and turn, and kept me hooked until the very end -- even with some of its questionable design decisions later in the main storyline.\n\nThe game starts out kind of slow, with you learning the ropes in a restrictive tutorial zone throughout Kamurocho. Luckily, this is not how the game stays, and Kamurocho is luckily only a bit of set dressing in this game. Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama, is where the real meat is at -- a delightfully large map (by RGG standards, being that it\'s four times the size of Kamurocho) with a lot to explore and take in. This is what the game really was designed around, and where the jRPG shenanigans really get into full swing.\n\nIsezaki Ijincho is divided into districts -- each with their own taxi locations that you have to *discover* before you can use them to travel to those locations, making you actually explore and discover Isezaki Ijincho for yourself -- that all have their own ""threat levels."" These threat levels are the game\'s way of telling you how strong the enemies in an area are -- and thus, how much of a threat they are to you. I love this, I wish more jRPGs told me this info. It\'s fantastic, and makes the experience of roaming a lot easier, and grinding even easier.\n\nThe main story follows Kasuga and his ragtag group of friends throughout the bustling city of Yokohama, as they find themselves slowly wedged into a feud. Bleach Japan are a group that want to cleanse the city of its ""gray zones,"" by any means necessary -- including using Yakuza muscle. Their interactions with BJ, as well as their work for a soapland, eventually lead them to walk into a sprung trap; from there, they really devolve into their big feud, with many twists and turns abound. As always, these games will find a way to make you emotional, and this one might be the most effective at that yet.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, RGG went for a simplistic, but delightful approach. You still roam about the city freely, like any Yakuza game, and the encounters still work similarly as the previous brawler entries -- but it\'s here where the big twist lies; Upon entering a battle, you are thrown into a very modern jRPG battle system: a simple menu divided into four halves, each for specific functions, your HP/MP counters, and a nice automatic battle system you can opt into and give light directions to. The four-button menu is neatly divided: Attack, Guard, Skills and Miscellaneous. The first three are fairly self-explanatory, and the latter brings you into a second menu for two more items, depending on whose turn it currently is: Items, and if you\'re Kasuga and have unlocked it, Poundmates. The poundmates are your summons, and include a wild variety from people you meet through sidequests and even a couple through the main story. They\'re awesome, and a great aid during battles.\n\nAnother core mechanic of the game is the Jobs system, which defines what skills, perks and weapons a character can use. Not all characters can have the same jobs, and most of them have in-game requirements to unlock; But rest assured, they\'re all great and with their own perks, and really allow you to build a good team for your preferred play style. Not to mention they\'re plenty wacky, with often goofy visuals and animations, to really ham up the silliness of the RPG battle system and its surrounding mechanics.\n\nAs I mentioned though, the game does have some critical flaws that have certainly gotten me a bit... [i]annoyed[/i] with the game -- namely how level scaling and difficulty curve intertwine. Up to chapter 9, so long as you do most of the provided content, you will have a breeze of a time, and no hitches. The boss of chapter 9 is where the issues start to arise, where I had to actually start grinding -- but available enemy groups gave little XP for the level I was at, and it was overall just a real slog to get my levels up. That\'s where a fair chunk of my playtime came from, as that took 32 hours across multiple days where I had the time to go grinding. Okay, so that done -- that was it, right? All good? Nah, it was a breeze up until Chapter 12 -- where it suddenly jumps the difficulty from your general level (Level 32-35 is what I\'ve seen most at, at that stage), up to level 50, with two beefcake bosses that also dish out a friggin\' BUTTLOAD of damage. At least this time they offer a battle arena with plenty of battles that dish out XP like scout cookies, and it made the grind a lot quicker! Only 12 hours, as opposed to 32, but that starts to show the issue -- levelling starts to require an inane amount of points, but the game is really stingy about handing that XP out unless you find very specific farming routines. This is where my fun started to fall apart, especially as I approached the final boss and was faced with the reality that I needed to grind again.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game, really is its climax. Any sense of satisfaction was taken away from me when I came to realise that the final boss has a conditional One-hit KO. One that favours targeting Kasuga, who, may I add, upon death, is an instant game over. This lead me to have to grind up my levels to a point where I can beat Mister Beefcake, Master of the OHKO, Tanker of All Damage, Owner of Almost All Resists, comfortably and stop his OHKO from actually being an OHKO. I don\'t know the statistics behind it, or what it\'s expecting, but it\'s a darn pain in the butt.\n\nI really felt robbed of a fair chunk of my satisfaction, but even so, I recommend this game wholeheartedly. Just be ready to grind out a lot of stuff. Be ready to get annoyed at this game at spots, as it tells you ""you\'ve not done enough yet!"" But even with all of those grievances, even with it being a slow burn at the start, this game is just a barrel of fun with an expertly written story. I didn\'t expect a lot of what had gone down in this story, and I\'m glad I took my time to play it and enjoy it. Absolutely worth every cent, whether you buy it during a sale or at full price. Support RGG, show them we want more of this, because this was, and is an awesome experience. I\'m sure I\'ll be replaying this with the Japanese VA soon.', 'I recommend it to:\n\n-People who don\'t like JRPGs (vs Western RPGs) but want to find a JRPG they like.\n-Similarly, people who are tired of the usual depiction of Japan in media. This game focusses more on the ""streets"" of Japan for lack of a better term, and the everyday people in them. The homeless, prostitutes, petty criminals, sleazy businessmen, etc...\n-People who like Gintama, as the humour, setting and characters share many similar features, aesthetics and themes.\n-Similarly, people who appreciate over the top and hammy combat as well as stories and situations (usually applies more to side content rather than the main story)\n-People who are looking for a video game main character that isn\'t two googly eyes stuck on a potato. Ichiban is interesting, dynamic, likeable and in a few ways quite relatable.\n\n', ""7/10. Enjoyable, but I liked previous Yakuza games a bit more.\n\nStrengths: Larger world than previous Yakuza games.\n  good batch of mini games.\n  equipment enhancement system gives a reason to grind.\n\nWeaknesses: Combat feels more goofy than epic. Boss fights just aren't as intense as the rest of the franchise. Boss fights just break down to repeatedly doing the same thing over and over which gets real old real fast. Longer isn't better.\n  Main story tries to adapt to having a 'party' but that just isn't consistent through the story. Side stories down right ignore the party except during any sort of fight. \n\nIf you are looking to scratch the Yakuza itch, buy this. If you want wacky adventures in Japan's underbelly, buy this. If you want to punch guys and feel epic doing it ... replay a different Yakuza game."", ""I still don't know how to play Mahjong."", 'Essence of the Orbital Laser+ I cried at the ending.', ""While I still recommend Yakuza:Like a Dragon and it may interest some newcomers from the RPG crowd, I have to say that as a fan of the series, I feel underwhelmed. The story between mid-chapters to the finale stretch a lot. Too many obvious plot points being elaborated over, and over and over.  Major battles don't feel as epic as any of the past game because it is restricted by the battle system.\n\nHowever, the game is still fun and its first chapters will manage to pull you in with its charms. The battle system is alright but IMO it needs to be less traditional and more inventive, to capture more of what we expect of the Yakuza series when it comes to epic and emotional battles.\n\nOn the technical side, the game runs very well on my PC and during my 100+ hours I experienced only one crash. I hope that SEGA continues this quality of publishing on their future PC ports."", ""I'd die for Ichiban because I know he'd do the same"", 'Yes', ""Overall, I really enjoyed this game, it was my entry point into the Yakuza series. It's got lots of heart and humour.\n\n The turn-based battle system is entertaining  at the onset but can get a bit tedious, mainly due to big spikes in difficulty in the last 3/4 into the game that force you through dungeons to level up.  That said, the endearing cast (well voiced) and interesting (albeit somewhat predictable) story-line kept me going. The cities in the game are lovingly crafted and there are plenty of side quests and mini games to indulge in if that's your kind of thing. \n\nThe game was also really polished (I didn't encounter any bugs) and it ran over 60 fps at 4K (RTX 3080) with no issues whatsoever.

The story is incredible and filled with brilliantly written and acted characters. \n\nThe protagonist, Ichiban, has quite the boots to fill now that we're not playing as Kiryu anymore. Ichiban is an amazing protagonist and without question does Kiryu justice. The emotional range is wider, and the positive outlook on everything that Ichiban invigorates sets him apart from Kiryu. They're both masterpieces of character development, writing and acting. \n\nThe gameplay is incredibly fun and addicting. Leveling up your character as well as the Job you have set at any given time. Jobs are essentially specializations that incorporate different roles like healing, magic/melee, or even tanking. There's tons of loot, materials for crafting gear, and an enormous variety of enemy designs. Since the game has taken this turn into JRPG territory it's allowed more traditional aspects of other RPGs. There's dungeons, tons of bosses and minibosses, an endgame activity that's very difficult, and more. There's well over 100 hours worth of content here and it all improves you and your party's abilities. \n\nMy complaints are negligible, there's sometimes too many enemies on the streets. That's pretty much it, Yakuza Like A Dragon is near perfect and a must play for anyone who's played the previous games and for anyone who wants to jump for the first time into this universe. Playing the previous games isn't necessary."", ""Unironically one of the best games i've played so far"", 'Right, where do I start...\n\nYakuza: Like a Dragon (later in this review Yakuza 7) has been my introduction to the Yakuza franchise as a whole. Prior to this, all I knew about was the Bakamitai meme, which I also only knew as the Dame Da Ne song. I was a bit sceptical about getting into it at first, as I knew absolutely nothing about the game and franchise as a whole, and Brawlers weren\'t really my thing, but then I heard that this game features a different protagonist, and instead of a Brawler, plays as a turn based RPG. I had some money left over from Christmas, and I\'m a big fan of the old Final Fantasy games, so I thought I might as well give it a try. Could always refund it if I didn\'t enjoy it. \n\nIn Yakuza 7, you play as Ichiban Kasuga, a Yakuza grunt who goes to jail to cover for a higher-ranking member of the Arakawa family, which he belongs to. Thinking that this would make him climb the Yakuza ladder, and that his patriarch will honour and appreciate his cover, he comes back after 18 years of prison time to find out that everybody had abandoned him. Former police officer Koichi Adachi researched about the Tojo Clan and the Arakawa Family, attempts to convince Ichiban to come with him to Yokohama to stay safe, but Ichiban refuses. Ichiban finds his way back to his former patriarch and is then met with an unfortunate fate.\n\nOh boy, I was immediately hooked from the start. ""That\'s a lot of cutscenes for a game, it\'s like I\'m watching a movie"" was my first thought. I liked story heavy games, but I felt a little overwhelmed on my first day, as out of the probably 5 or 6 hours that I was playing, 4 of them were just watching cutscenes. Now this might turn some people down, especially if they just want to enjoy the gameplay, but all the introductory scenes got me more invested in finding out about the presented characters and I didn\'t just want to stop playing until I found a point where I thought ""Okay, now the actual game finally begins.""\n\nThe vast majority of this game takes plays in the streets of Yokohama, more specifically, Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama\'s red light district. The world is incredibly detailed and you\'ll be pleasantly surprised to know that there\'s things hidden in every single corner. I really enjoy exploring in video games, trying to see if there\'s things hidden in places nobody would think of and-- to my surprise, they really thought of everything here. I try sneaking into a corner that I think might not even be intended to go to, and yet, there\'s something there for me to pick up. \n\nI personally went for the ""50% main story, 50% side story"" approach, which to me means - I\'ll do 2 or 3 side quests, of which there are plenty in Yakuza 7, and then I\'ll do a few story quests so that I can keep up with what is happening. And trust me, there\'s a lot of content to burn through. All of the sidequests are very well designed, and most of them got at least a little bit of a chuckle from me, so I\'d like to think that they are quite humorous. Once done with the sidequests, I grabbed my imaginary bucket of popcorn and started getting immersed in the story. \n\nAfter I arrived in Yokohama, and the game properly begun for me, I thought to myself that this would be a silly little hero adventure. One of a redemption arc where Ichiban becomes the hero of a big and epic tale. Well, it\'s kinda like that, it starts off slow and adventurous, but the more the story goes on, Ichiban falls deeper into this crime drama rabbit hole. I will not spoil anything for the sake of letting you enjoy it by yourself, but I can say you\'re in for a treat. A big one. \n\nThe gameplay itself is, as mentioned earlier, a turn based RPG. I hit you, then I wait, then you hit me, and then you wait. Yakuza 7 adds a nice little twist to that by adding small, simple QTEs to most of your abilities. Sometimes you might have to press a button repeatedly to give it more power, sometimes you might need to press the button at the proper time instead. Sometimes even both! It\'s a very, very simple thing but it keeps the combat entertaining, which is the main purpose. All attack animations look nice and polished too, some of the names and descriptions are silly and will put a weird look on your face when you first see it, but all skills feels nice to use. You might not have many skills when you first start the game, but the more you progress, the more and more skills will be added to your arsenal.\n\nThis game works in a job system, which you might be familiar with if you played some Final Fantasy games. While each character has their own primary main job, they can also switch to other jobs, which in this game are gender locked. Male characters can choose from a variety of different jobs, and female characters have their own jobs to choose from, too. Some of these jobs exist for both genders, although slightly altered, such as Host for males and Hostess for females. They essentially do the same thing, yet they slightly differ from one another.\n\nNow, apart from the amazing story that this game has to offer, and the ability to throw ridiculous-looking skills at your enemies, there\'s also plenty of minigames that you can play in this game. Of course, there\'s Karaoke (also with Bakamitai!), Mahjong, Shogi and Dragon Kart (yes, like actual kart racing) just to name a few. Each of these felt well thought out and they\'re fun to do, and you can seriously get invested in them if you\'re dedicated enough. Sometimes I booted this game up just to play a little bit of Mahjong...\n\nBut there\'s probably a few negatives about this game, right? Yes there are, but in my personal opinion, these are just minor things that probably won\'t even bother you unless you think really hard about it. What I disliked during my playthrough is that there\'s just. so. many. random. encounters. I was told by a friend that this is common in the Yakuza games, and that you\'ll have to just deal with it, but god there\'s just so many. Happens a lot that you walk down one street and you get hit with 3 or 4 different encounters that really badly want to murder you. There is an item in this game that completely removes random encounters, but I feel like you\'ll get access to it way too late. By the time you have it, you\'re probably able to finish the game for good already. Another issue that I had in this game is that there was one dungeon that just felt way too long to complete. It wasn\'t even challenging or anything, you just entered a new floor and thought ""this is it"", only to be hit with a wave of disappointment as you realize this is just another floor with the same enemies as the last one. It was a slog to get through it, but luckily it\'s only a one time thing.\n\nSo, what can I say to finalize this review? I think that Yakuza 7 is an amazing game, with a well written and properly thought out story that is guaranteed to keep you glued to your screen, fun and entertaining combat to keep you playing, and a wide variety of different minigames that you grind out, or even just relax with if you feel like. Ichiban and his party makes it feel like you\'re part of the crew, that his achievements and goals are yours too, and that you too can overcome any obstacle if you just believe in yourself and don\'t give up. Ichiban Kasuga has been one of the most relateable characters I have ever met and he\'s found a place in my heart that I will protect. This game has also made me buy all the other main Yakuza games and I\'m motivated to play through all of them, at the time of this review I am currently on Yakuza 4 Remastered. As I found out while playing, there are plenty of references to the older Yakuza games that will make you go ""Oooh, I know this"" when you see them, and they still don\'t feel out of place when you\'re new to it. I am very happy that this game introduced me to the series and I have no shame admitting that I cried when it was over.', ""Heartfelt and great story telling with Final Fantasy/Dragon Quest combat? Awesome!\nNever played a Dragon Quest before this one but I think I'll have to say that it's my favorite one. \nThe story is great and there are so many minigames within that can keep you hooked especially with the wackiness that happens based on the side quests and even the different classes.\n\nCutscenes are super long but aside from that, the story is like a really really long movie."", 'As a Yakuza game, its about what you expect. The game is at times a soap opera, then its grounded in reality and then its goes to some REALLY bizarre and absurd places, and thats just great. Ichiban is NOT Kiryu, we trade super manly ideal super strong dad for a gold hearted goofball badass idiot, and its kind of okay, hes way less of a power fantasy and more of a relatable character thats struggling to make it in life, which at times hits too close to home. As an rpg, its kinda clunky and not too deep, visually its very good. The narrative is what I enjoyed the most from this game, and its pretty good. 8/10, worth your time and money.', '[i]--This [b]will[/b] contain some big spoilers. Don\'t yell at me.--[/i]\n\nThe newest entry into the Yakuza franchise, and RGG\'s first foray into the jRPG genre -- and generally, what a blast this is. It\'s captivated me with every step and turn, and kept me hooked until the very end -- even with some of its questionable design decisions later in the main storyline.\n\nThe game starts out kind of slow, with you learning the ropes in a restrictive tutorial zone throughout Kamurocho. Luckily, this is not how the game stays, and Kamurocho is luckily only a bit of set dressing in this game. Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama, is where the real meat is at -- a delightfully large map (by RGG standards, being that it\'s four times the size of Kamurocho) with a lot to explore and take in. This is what the game really was designed around, and where the jRPG shenanigans really get into full swing.\n\nIsezaki Ijincho is divided into districts -- each with their own taxi locations that you have to *discover* before you can use them to travel to those locations, making you actually explore and discover Isezaki Ijincho for yourself -- that all have their own ""threat levels."" These threat levels are the game\'s way of telling you how strong the enemies in an area are -- and thus, how much of a threat they are to you. I love this, I wish more jRPGs told me this info. It\'s fantastic, and makes the experience of roaming a lot easier, and grinding even easier.\n\nThe main story follows Kasuga and his ragtag group of friends throughout the bustling city of Yokohama, as they find themselves slowly wedged into a feud. Bleach Japan are a group that want to cleanse the city of its ""gray zones,"" by any means necessary -- including using Yakuza muscle. Their interactions with BJ, as well as their work for a soapland, eventually lead them to walk into a sprung trap; from there, they really devolve into their big feud, with many twists and turns abound. As always, these games will find a way to make you emotional, and this one might be the most effective at that yet.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, RGG went for a simplistic, but delightful approach. You still roam about the city freely, like any Yakuza game, and the encounters still work similarly as the previous brawler entries -- but it\'s here where the big twist lies; Upon entering a battle, you are thrown into a very modern jRPG battle system: a simple menu divided into four halves, each for specific functions, your HP/MP counters, and a nice automatic battle system you can opt into and give light directions to. The four-button menu is neatly divided: Attack, Guard, Skills and Miscellaneous. The first three are fairly self-explanatory, and the latter brings you into a second menu for two more items, depending on whose turn it currently is: Items, and if you\'re Kasuga and have unlocked it, Poundmates. The poundmates are your summons, and include a wild variety from people you meet through sidequests and even a couple through the main story. They\'re awesome, and a great aid during battles.\n\nAnother core mechanic of the game is the Jobs system, which defines what skills, perks and weapons a character can use. Not all characters can have the same jobs, and most of them have in-game requirements to unlock; But rest assured, they\'re all great and with their own perks, and really allow you to build a good team for your preferred play style. Not to mention they\'re plenty wacky, with often goofy visuals and animations, to really ham up the silliness of the RPG battle system and its surrounding mechanics.\n\nAs I mentioned though, the game does have some critical flaws that have certainly gotten me a bit... [i]annoyed[/i] with the game -- namely how level scaling and difficulty curve intertwine. Up to chapter 9, so long as you do most of the provided content, you will have a breeze of a time, and no hitches. The boss of chapter 9 is where the issues start to arise, where I had to actually start grinding -- but available enemy groups gave little XP for the level I was at, and it was overall just a real slog to get my levels up. That\'s where a fair chunk of my playtime came from, as that took 32 hours across multiple days where I had the time to go grinding. Okay, so that done -- that was it, right? All good? Nah, it was a breeze up until Chapter 12 -- where it suddenly jumps the difficulty from your general level (Level 32-35 is what I\'ve seen most at, at that stage), up to level 50, with two beefcake bosses that also dish out a friggin\' BUTTLOAD of damage. At least this time they offer a battle arena with plenty of battles that dish out XP like scout cookies, and it made the grind a lot quicker! Only 12 hours, as opposed to 32, but that starts to show the issue -- levelling starts to require an inane amount of points, but the game is really stingy about handing that XP out unless you find very specific farming routines. This is where my fun started to fall apart, especially as I approached the final boss and was faced with the reality that I needed to grind again.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game, really is its climax. Any sense of satisfaction was taken away from me when I came to realise that the final boss has a conditional One-hit KO. One that favours targeting Kasuga, who, may I add, upon death, is an instant game over. This lead me to have to grind up my levels to a point where I can beat Mister Beefcake, Master of the OHKO, Tanker of All Damage, Owner of Almost All Resists, comfortably and stop his OHKO from actually being an OHKO. I don\'t know the statistics behind it, or what it\'s expecting, but it\'s a darn pain in the butt.\n\nI really felt robbed of a fair chunk of my satisfaction, but even so, I recommend this game wholeheartedly. Just be ready to grind out a lot of stuff. Be ready to get annoyed at this game at spots, as it tells you ""you\'ve not done enough yet!"" But even with all of those grievances, even with it being a slow burn at the start, this game is just a barrel of fun with an expertly written story. I didn\'t expect a lot of what had gone down in this story, and I\'m glad I took my time to play it and enjoy it. Absolutely worth every cent, whether you buy it during a sale or at full price. Support RGG, show them we want more of this, because this was, and is an awesome experience. I\'m sure I\'ll be replaying this with the Japanese VA soon.', 'I recommend it to:\n\n-People who don\'t like JRPGs (vs Western RPGs) but want to find a JRPG they like.\n-Similarly, people who are tired of the usual depiction of Japan in media. This game focusses more on the ""streets"" of Japan for lack of a better term, and the everyday people in them. The homeless, prostitutes, petty criminals, sleazy businessmen, etc...\n-People who like Gintama, as the humour, setting and characters share many similar features, aesthetics and themes.\n-Similarly, people who appreciate over the top and hammy combat as well as stories and situations (usually applies more to side content rather than the main story)\n-People who are looking for a video game main character that isn\'t two googly eyes stuck on a potato. Ichiban is interesting, dynamic, likeable and in a few ways quite relatable.\n\n', ""7/10. Enjoyable, but I liked previous Yakuza games a bit more.\n\nStrengths: Larger world than previous Yakuza games.\n  good batch of mini games.\n  equipment enhancement system gives a reason to grind.\n\nWeaknesses: Combat feels more goofy than epic. Boss fights just aren't as intense as the rest of the franchise. Boss fights just break down to repeatedly doing the same thing over and over which gets real old real fast. Longer isn't better.\n  Main story tries to adapt to having a 'party' but that just isn't consistent through the story. Side stories down right ignore the party except during any sort of fight. \n\nIf you are looking to scratch the Yakuza itch, buy this. If you want wacky adventures in Japan's underbelly, buy this. If you want to punch guys and feel epic doing it ... replay a different Yakuza game."", ""I still don't know how to play Mahjong."", 'Essence of the Orbital Laser+ I cried at the ending.', ""While I still recommend Yakuza:Like a Dragon and it may interest some newcomers from the RPG crowd, I have to say that as a fan of the series, I feel underwhelmed. The story between mid-chapters to the finale stretch a lot. Too many obvious plot points being elaborated over, and over and over.  Major battles don't feel as epic as any of the past game because it is restricted by the battle system.\n\nHowever, the game is still fun and its first chapters will manage to pull you in with its charms. The battle system is alright but IMO it needs to be less traditional and more inventive, to capture more of what we expect of the Yakuza series when it comes to epic and emotional battles.\n\nOn the technical side, the game runs very well on my PC and during my 100+ hours I experienced only one crash. I hope that SEGA continues this quality of publishing on their future PC ports."", ""I'd die for Ichiban because I know he'd do the same"", 'Yes', ""Overall, I really enjoyed this game, it was my entry point into the Yakuza series. It's got lots of heart and humour.\n\n The turn-based battle system is entertaining  at the onset but can get a bit tedious, mainly due to big spikes in difficulty in the last 3/4 into the game that force you through dungeons to level up.  That said, the endearing cast (well voiced) and interesting (albeit somewhat predictable) story-line kept me going. The cities in the game are lovingly crafted and there are plenty of side quests and mini games to indulge in if that's your kind of thing. \n\nThe game was also really polished (I didn't encounter any bugs) and it ran over 60 fps at 4K (RTX 3080) with no issues whatsoever.  Refreshing in these days of buggy, poorly optimised games. \n\n"", ""10/10 there's a chicken named Omelette who runs a restaurant."", 'i wanna fuck the shit out of this game', 'Local schizophrenic man goes on a mission to become a better person.']"

You can have a lot of fun trying to get better reviews and scores. It's considerably one of the funniest small games I've played in a long time. To the developers, your game is extremely well made. Although, I wish you could have a longer story span. Reaching over 70 or 100 years. It would be cool to see new workers come as go as time goes by as well as new owners. That's only my opinion though. The game could use a few newer ways. Like be able to develop technology even further than what the game allows. The game can be stale at times with the repetitiveness but because it's such a small game with a small developer, it's promising nonetheless. Thank you for an amazing experience. I will be playing this for days on end in the future <3"", 'I pirated this game (then bought it)\n\ngood game', 'gameing', 'I have never had so much fun increasing sliders and watching numbers go up.\n\n\nThis game focuses on simple mechanics. You simply put your limited time/resources into focusing on certain aspects of a game which depends on the genre/topic combination. The correct/appealing combinations are generally intuitive to real life, as making an action game with no graphics but a good story is probably gonna be a flop. You have to balance skill/time/money with features and quality. (Features where you decide ""hmm open world or in game economy?""). All of this combines to bring about a really enjoyable experience, and really nails down the point ""you cannot make a game everything.""\n\nBalancing game creation with research is a great balancing act. In-between developing games, you can decide to research certain game features over others, gaining the ability to incorporate it into a gaming engine. You can maximize your time by specializing your research and engines to have features for specific genres and topics (Genres being casual/action/RPG and topics being horror/expeditions/superheros). It also slightly punishes you for being focused on singular topics, as repeating the same old games will get negative reviews, but more than that, it hurts your staff from gaining experience. It all results in an engaging balancing act that encourages your company to focus on specific types of games while trying to explore new ground.\n\nCompany building in this game is satisfying, but I was left with wanting more. As you get bigger and better, so does the technology and your competitors. You have to get skilled staff in order to keep up, while also paying them six figure salaries for said staff. You will gradually grow you business to have new tech and offices, even starting your own RnD department to research tech no one has or developing your own hardware. During the later game, I was left with wanting more, to grow my company further. Moreover, the extra departments you only get right when the game ends and the tech advances slow to a halt. Moreover, the mechanics of each department are ""Invest x money and it goes faster"" which is not very satisfying, I was left with wanting more, but it is nice to have what you get.\n\nBye no means is the game ""10 out of 10, now take my money, all of it."" It will seriously lag when you get four employees, and this is a 2d sim game on my beefcake computer. Moreover, the reviews and little story events eventually become ""click here to gain risk/bonus."" I wish there were more story events to keep me engaged and feeling immersed while I watch little number bubbles tick up to finish a game. There was a lot of potential here and the lack of the story makes this game fall short of the Russian border guard sim ""Papers, Please"" Now, I was not expecting as good of a story or events, but it would have been nice, instead of min-maxing events that have a correct/incorrect answer. Say there is a reviewer that comes along and shits on your game for no reason, or that a competitor copies your game, hurting your sales, and you have branching decisions to deal with. Being now a master gamer developer myself, it does not seem hard to add it with some lines of text and/ codes for debuffs.\n\nOverall, this game is not expensive and is an engaging but simplistic. It does not look like much in the screenshots, but you will generally feel like you are developing video games.\n\n', 'its fun but a bit short..', ""[quote]\n⚖️ Grade = B.

It seems like it takes ~15-16 hours to finish the available jobs.\n\nMy current criticisms are that the game really needs to balance out its criteria for enough dirt having been washed away to consider a segment complete--it'll either jump to finished with a substantial chunk left to clean and deprive you of that experience, or you'll spend forever walking around in circles, hitting tab, trying to find the angle that'll show you the minuscule speck of dirt that's left to clean up. \n\nDefinitely recommend if you like the cleaning portions of House Flipper or Viscera Cleanup Detail, although it's a little flatter on the ground so far than either of those."", ""Ok so when I first went to purchase this I thought it's gonna be one of those sims I spend 10 mins in and get bored but its 6 hours in and I can't get enough! haha.

It seems like it takes ~15-16 hours to finish the available jobs.\n\nMy current criticisms are that the game really needs to balance out its criteria for enough dirt having been washed away to consider a segment complete--it'll either jump to finished with a substantial chunk left to clean and deprive you of that experience, or you'll spend forever walking around in circles, hitting tab, trying to find the angle that'll show you the minuscule speck of dirt that's left to clean up. \n\nDefinitely recommend if you like the cleaning portions of House Flipper or Viscera Cleanup Detail, although it's a little flatter on the ground so far than either of those."", ""Ok so when I first went to purchase this I thought it's gonna be one of those sims I spend 10 mins in and get bored but its 6 hours in and I can't get enough! haha.

It is mainly a comedy type game parodying video gaming while also containing several puzzles to solve.\n\nTo start with one of the best aspects of this game, the art used is excellent throughout. The style throughout most of the game is stylized pixel art. I found that the art was beautifully done in all respects not just for the main scenes of the game, but it also nails different styles of art from the games it parodies from the 1990s. The game's creators really did a great job of mostly sticking to pixel art, but using it in a variety of creative ways to create different types of scenes.\n\nThe sound design works quite well in multiple respects, too. The music in the game is a joy to listen to. As with the artwork, there are many types of musical tracks depending on the section of the game from a heartfelt song about love and loss to a hilarious rap track. The sound in the game is bolstered by the excellent narration work done by Pascal Cammisotto playing The Game and a few other characters as well (and who also was a writer).\n\nThe real meat of this game would be the writing and story. As mentioned above, this is mainly a comedy and parody game. I will try to avoid spoilers here as it is best to go into the game knowing little for the fullest enjoyment. I will say that the writing and experience of the game is quite enjoyable. At its core, the game is essentially a parody of video games much in the same vein as [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/221910/The_Stanley_Parable]The Stanley Parable[/url][/i] (2013). Indeed, it seems that [i]There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension[/i] took much inspiration from [i]The Stanley Parable[/i] from the over-the-top narrator frustrating or being frustrated by the human player to the meta humor and commentary on video gaming as a medium. Suffice it to say that if you liked the type of humor and writing in a game like [i]The Stanley Parable[/i], you will enjoy [i]There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension[/i].\n\nIn addition to the meta-humor, the game nails its parodies of video games themselves taking a good amount of inspiration from games of the 1990s. These parodies include a sequence based on LucasArts adventure games such as [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/388210/Day_of_the_Tentacle_Remastered/]Day of the Tentacle[/url][/i] (1993) and some of the earlier titles of [i]The Legend of Zelda[/i] series. The game does a good job of evoking the styles, including art and sound, of these games.\n\nWhile mostly a comedic game, this also contains many puzzles to solve to progress the story. I found that the puzzles were enjoyable and not so difficult as to be aggravating. The game does have a built-in hint system if you truly get stuck while the narration will offer a few subtle clues to push you in the right direction. Some of the puzzles were definitely on the easier side, though, so if you really want to play this specifically for the puzzles, you may be disappointed.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed what this game had to offer with its bizarre and meta sense of humor, stunning graphics, and enjoyable music.

Seeing as it was a bartending game, I wasn't positive if it would be a very involved or overly simplistic approach to said genre of food preparation releases. Well, the gameplay is a bit strange at first and you might need to practice with the system for a few minutes, but after you get a basic grasp of it, the game is rather simple. Sure, there are some orders you must know to serve with intuition and deduction skills, but besides this, it would be hard to fail a day or somehow manage not to pay your rent on time, which is the main objective of the game. There are items you can buy to increase your performance later on during your shift, websites you can visit to squeeze out more lore from the game, and even a mini-game you can attempt to complete on the side after purchasing the game console in the aforementioned store. Luckily, the main focus is not on the gameplay, but rather, the characters and the narrative they are all intertwined in in some way or another, as the gameplay, in all honest, would not be strong enough to carry an entire game. \n\n[i]VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action[/i] is more so about the people that walk into your place of work and tell you about recent news, personal information, and just small talk about whatever they find worthwhile. You can build relationships with them through getting their orders correct, and in some cases, deciding what is best for them under certain circumstances, which can unlock their respective endings if you guess correctly. What I did not really expect from this game that I got was a sense of maturity when handling certain subject matters, such as dealing with grief and moving forward in life. What I did sort of expect, however, were unrealistic fantastical elements that are reminiscent of other anime-inspired pieces. When I say fantastical, it is not to say that it is enchanting, but rather unrealistic. Obviously, this game is not meant to be realistic in the slightest when it comes to the premise, but there are good and bad qualities pertaining to being unrealistic one must compare to understand what I mean. Cat woman cyborg hybrids and talking dogs with Hawaiian shirts and sunglasses can be charming and creative additions to a game, but when you attempt to create a game or really any media that is both funny and serious, there had to be a good balancing act taking place. Most of the time, the game does a great job, but sometimes, it misses and I was left with either a bad taste in my mouth or just bored and uninvolved.\n\nDuring the game, there will be very eventful days and some throwaway ones. Since the game is focused on the rather mundane goal of being able to afford a porn subscription (yes, that is the first primary objective) and ultimately pay your rent, the ending feels rather anticlimactic as a result. Even though there is a main plot point that takes hold around the halfway point which gives the player a look further into the protagonist's  past and present personal life and this leads the rest of the story to this specific concluding point, the point still stands that this piece can lack direction at times. Now, if you have seen any type of story in which this type of character development takes place (meaning the one [i]Jill[/i], the protagonist, faces), you won't really get that much more out of the way this story goes through the same motions, especially because it doesn't try to do anything but the bare minimum to get across its message. Some other characters fell flat for me as well, such as [i]Dana[/i], the boss, and [i]Gillian[/i], your co-bartender, leaving two core characters I was supposed to be acquainted with not fulfilling their purpose, which is rather disappointing in its own right.\n\nBesides these two main gripes, though, I really did have a good time with this game.

There\'s people from all walks of life here, and if you have a problem, you can surely at least discuss it here.\nWhatever the case, someone in Kind Words is always all-ears. As an exception to what you may expect from the Internet, the letters here are sincere, genuine, even heartfelt. The friendly community that this game has created given its complete anonymity is nothing short of a wonder.\nSadly, there\'s the odd outliers every once in a while, but they\'re definitely a minority.

These people helped me out immensely with things I\'d find hard to even spill to people I hold closest.\nStill, as said before:\n[b]Kind Words is not fit for replacement of professional mental aid, be it therapy, or counseling, but Kind Words is a perfect additive to such treatment, or even your life in general.[/b]\nAnd, well, it costs less than a coffee. Definitely try it out.\n AND, and, the letters get delivered by a deer. \n...no, that\'s not related to my profile pic.', ""No joke, I had the idea of a game like this a few years back that I could never make. I'm so glad someone had the same idea to make this so everyone could help each other out! 10000/10. Just remember, you're not alone in this!"", 'Kind Words made me feel very special when I first launched it. I had never seen a place on the Internet where everyone was so nice and friendly while also remaining completely anonymous. Most of us know from first-hand experience that anonymity tends to bring forth the worst in people, but something about this app keeps the vile and the bitter at bay. Suffice it to say that I [i]almost[/i] shed a single manly tear while going through paper aeroplane letters with simple encouragements and words of wisdom. This was a special moment; I was thinking to myself that I\'d found the ultimate way of spending my free time – writing supportive letters to strangers, asking for advice and guidance myself, using screensavers with chill lo-fi music while I\'m working or studying. However, what felt like love turned out to be a mere infatuation that died as quickly as it had come – four hours later it was gone without a trace. If you look at other reviewers, you will notice a similar trend.\n\n[h1]Why?[/h1]\n\nWell, ask yourself: [b]do you [i]actually[/i] need Kind Words?[/b] I mean, have you got something gnawing away at your heart, something that keeps you awake at night, the burden you want to get off your chest? Maybe the stuff that you wouldn\'t share with your dearest friend or even your loved ones for fear of judgement or ridicule? Do you have any mental health issues; are you depressed? If so, then this application might be just the right thing for you, and it\'s the main reason I recommend it. However, I\'m happy to say that I don\'t really need any help or words of support; I\'m doing all right, have been for a long time now, and I\'m planning to keep it that way. The only option for me (and for many of you as well, I suppose) would then be to respond to requests submitted by those whom I described above. This might be very rewarding for a couple of hours and you might feel like you\'re actually making a bit of a difference, but...\n[list]\n\n[*]...the requests are a mess. [i]""What\'s your favourite band/videogame/book?"", ""Tell me about something good/bad that happened to you today"", ""I want stickers, send me stickers!"", ""Tell me a joke – looking to laugh out loud!""[/i] – these are so common that sifting through the list gets a bit frustrating at times. People forget that Kind Words is not supposed to be a run-of-the-mill chat app, but a safe space for those who are struggling. Problems don\'t end there; if you are hurting and you want to submit a request, you\'re only allowed to do so in a very limited number of lines. This drives many people to send multiple requests as parts of one story and give them numbers: 1/3, 2/3, 3/3... Unfortunately, you view a random selection of requests in no particular order, and oftentimes stumble upon a ""2/3"" with no way of knowing what the person is talking about as there is no way to read neither the beginning nor the end of it;\n\n[*]...your letters can only be 14 lines long, and the influence of this limitation is tremendous. I understand that the developers made a conscious choice here and I see why they would do that – no need to write a scientific thesis in reply to a simple request asking for a piece of advice – but what I\'ve found is that this restriction kills the uniqueness of each letter and stifles its potential impact. Most things you\'ll send are bound to be generic [i]""Don\'t worry, it\'ll be all right"".[/i] [u]The person who\'s hurting is not allowed to express their feelings completely,[/u] thus forced to send multiple requests and have their voices not be heard, and [u]you\'re barely able to offer anything other than a few watery clichés,[/u] those hang ons and stay strongs, with very few exceptions.\n[/list]\n\nBy and large, if you\'re doing fine and life is good, Kind Words will test the very nature of your supposed altruism. Are you able to put up with these things that turned me away so fast? Maybe. But I still think that if you want to [b][i]give[/i][/b], you also need to be able to [b][i]receive[/i][/b] in return – at least that\'s how I believe it works with most people. Only replying to requests and not leaving any will create an imbalance, the feeling of an annoying chore which is bound to get old fairly quickly, and the issues I told you about won\'t make it any easier. Keep this in mind when you decide to purchase. \n\nHowever, if it takes everything that you have to face the day, if you feel like a disappointment, if your heart is broken, if your loved one is sick – there is probably no better virtual place you can be, even with all its shortcomings. Nothing beats professional help, of course, but Kind Words comes to your aid if seeking counsel is not an option.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1070710/Kind_Words_lo_fi_chill_beats_to_write_to/', ""it's so lovely to connect with other people. getting and giving support is so good for my mental health. it's a really lovely community here<3"", 'At first when I bought this game, I posted once, got some help, and felt better.

There\'s people from all walks of life here, and if you have a problem, you can surely at least discuss it here.\nWhatever the case, someone in Kind Words is always all-ears. As an exception to what you may expect from the Internet, the letters here are sincere, genuine, even heartfelt. The friendly community that this game has created given its complete anonymity is nothing short of a wonder.\nSadly, there\'s the odd outliers every once in a while, but they\'re definitely a minority.

These people helped me out immensely with things I\'d find hard to even spill to people I hold closest.\nStill, as said before:\n[b]Kind Words is not fit for replacement of professional mental aid, be it therapy, or counseling, but Kind Words is a perfect additive to such treatment, or even your life in general.[/b]\nAnd, well, it costs less than a coffee. Definitely try it out.\n AND, and, the letters get delivered by a deer. \n...no, that\'s not related to my profile pic.', ""No joke, I had the idea of a game like this a few years back that I could never make. I'm so glad someone had the same idea to make this so everyone could help each other out! 10000/10. Just remember, you're not alone in this!"", 'Kind Words made me feel very special when I first launched it. I had never seen a place on the Internet where everyone was so nice and friendly while also remaining completely anonymous. Most of us know from first-hand experience that anonymity tends to bring forth the worst in people, but something about this app keeps the vile and the bitter at bay. Suffice it to say that I [i]almost[/i] shed a single manly tear while going through paper aeroplane letters with simple encouragements and words of wisdom. This was a special moment; I was thinking to myself that I\'d found the ultimate way of spending my free time – writing supportive letters to strangers, asking for advice and guidance myself, using screensavers with chill lo-fi music while I\'m working or studying. However, what felt like love turned out to be a mere infatuation that died as quickly as it had come – four hours later it was gone without a trace. If you look at other reviewers, you will notice a similar trend.\n\n[h1]Why?[/h1]\n\nWell, ask yourself: [b]do you [i]actually[/i] need Kind Words?[/b] I mean, have you got something gnawing away at your heart, something that keeps you awake at night, the burden you want to get off your chest? Maybe the stuff that you wouldn\'t share with your dearest friend or even your loved ones for fear of judgement or ridicule? Do you have any mental health issues; are you depressed? If so, then this application might be just the right thing for you, and it\'s the main reason I recommend it. However, I\'m happy to say that I don\'t really need any help or words of support; I\'m doing all right, have been for a long time now, and I\'m planning to keep it that way. The only option for me (and for many of you as well, I suppose) would then be to respond to requests submitted by those whom I described above. This might be very rewarding for a couple of hours and you might feel like you\'re actually making a bit of a difference, but...\n[list]\n\n[*]...the requests are a mess. [i]""What\'s your favourite band/videogame/book?"", ""Tell me about something good/bad that happened to you today"", ""I want stickers, send me stickers!"", ""Tell me a joke – looking to laugh out loud!""[/i] – these are so common that sifting through the list gets a bit frustrating at times. People forget that Kind Words is not supposed to be a run-of-the-mill chat app, but a safe space for those who are struggling. Problems don\'t end there; if you are hurting and you want to submit a request, you\'re only allowed to do so in a very limited number of lines. This drives many people to send multiple requests as parts of one story and give them numbers: 1/3, 2/3, 3/3... Unfortunately, you view a random selection of requests in no particular order, and oftentimes stumble upon a ""2/3"" with no way of knowing what the person is talking about as there is no way to read neither the beginning nor the end of it;\n\n[*]...your letters can only be 14 lines long, and the influence of this limitation is tremendous. I understand that the developers made a conscious choice here and I see why they would do that – no need to write a scientific thesis in reply to a simple request asking for a piece of advice – but what I\'ve found is that this restriction kills the uniqueness of each letter and stifles its potential impact. Most things you\'ll send are bound to be generic [i]""Don\'t worry, it\'ll be all right"".[/i] [u]The person who\'s hurting is not allowed to express their feelings completely,[/u] thus forced to send multiple requests and have their voices not be heard, and [u]you\'re barely able to offer anything other than a few watery clichés,[/u] those hang ons and stay strongs, with very few exceptions.\n[/list]\n\nBy and large, if you\'re doing fine and life is good, Kind Words will test the very nature of your supposed altruism. Are you able to put up with these things that turned me away so fast? Maybe. But I still think that if you want to [b][i]give[/i][/b], you also need to be able to [b][i]receive[/i][/b] in return – at least that\'s how I believe it works with most people. Only replying to requests and not leaving any will create an imbalance, the feeling of an annoying chore which is bound to get old fairly quickly, and the issues I told you about won\'t make it any easier. Keep this in mind when you decide to purchase. \n\nHowever, if it takes everything that you have to face the day, if you feel like a disappointment, if your heart is broken, if your loved one is sick – there is probably no better virtual place you can be, even with all its shortcomings. Nothing beats professional help, of course, but Kind Words comes to your aid if seeking counsel is not an option.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1070710/Kind_Words_lo_fi_chill_beats_to_write_to/', ""it's so lovely to connect with other people. getting and giving support is so good for my mental health. it's a really lovely community here<3"", 'At first when I bought this game, I posted once, got some help, and felt better.

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Indie,250900,"['its ok', 'Alright, I\'ve waited years to do this, and finally it\'s time to put forth a review here.\n\nFor context, Isaac was one of the two games (the other being Spelunky) that got me to dump AAA games and switch to almost exclusively playing indies (AAA games getting progressively more slimy and worthless also helped though).  That was the ORIGINAL Isaac, and it was seriously just THAT DARNED GOOD.  And then Rebirth came out and upgraded EVERYTHING.  Needless to say, this is by far one of my favorite games of all time.  Top 3, I\'d say.  Considering I\'ve been gaming since the days of the 2600... that\'s extremely high praise.\n\nSo yeah.  I like it.  But I\'m going to do this review a bit different.  Instead of talking about what the game is like and all of that like I usually do, let\'s just go over some good/bad points, and maybe a bit about the expansions.\n\nFirst, the good.  Well, there is a LOT of good here.  The design of basically everything is outright masterful, and there is an absolutely stupid amount of content here.  An absolutely astonishing number of items, enemies, bosses, areas, and so on.  Getting 1000+ hours out of this game isnt exactly unheard of, and it\'s very easy to see why.\n\nWhat\'s more, despite the roguelike nature of it, Isaac is a skill-based game.  RNG cant kill you... unless you let it.  Skill, knowledge, and making good decisions... like any good roguelike, that\'s what wins runs for you here.  This is a game that gets it RIGHT.  ...Mostly.  With 20 bazillionty enemies/bosses/rooms you do get a dud here and there, occaisional things that rather need an overhaul as they can produce unavoidable attacks.  Fortunately, this is quite rare (and expansions make it more rare).  But still, it DOES happen every now and then.  \n\nAlso, the items you find are often just lots of fun to use.  So many creative concepts here.  And the concept of wild synergies just adds to the fun, and makes it so that runs can be so wildly different from one another that even 800+ hours in (I have the game on other platforms) I *still* am surprised by it at times.\n\nCharacter variety also goes a long way here... there\'s a darned wide cast of dudes to pick from, and drastically moreso if you buy the expansions.  \n\nThe controls are superb, though one small issue is that Isaac\'s hitbox is... strange.  Even to this day I sometimes find myself not *quite* sure just where it is, particularly as his sprite evolves and warps as you get items.  That\'s a pretty minor issue though.\n\nAnd the game can be so darned exciting... when it\'s being challenging.\n\nOne major issue that I\'ve always had with Isaac is that, by default, it is simply far, far too easy.  If you\'re used to other roguelikes, this one in its base state will be child\'s play to you.  It has ""balance issues"", and that\'s putting it VERY mildly.  The game is FAR too easy, allowing the player to become an overpowered disaster almost every run once you know how (and it sure aint hard to figure out how).  While some players like that, I\'ve always found it fantastically boring... I\'m sorry, but ""enter room and push win button"" over and over again in 70% of runs isnt very interesting and I find that my interest fades very fast... up until recently, while I love the game, I didnt PLAY it all that often due to the fact that the absolute lack of challenge would cause me to lose interest fast.\n\nFortunately, that changed with Repentance.  That DLC performs an absolute overhaul of the game\'s balance, and turns it into more of a PROPER roguelike... darned difficult, and drastically less common that you will get overpowered.  It becomes more in line with other games in this genre, and to me that is a very good thing.  Not to mention that DLC also just adds tons of amazing content.  So, if you want any actual challenge... make sure to pick that up, otherwise you really wont find much of any.  The game is seriously mindless without it.\n\nBut, even with that, there are still other issues.  Two particular things stand out to me:  The absolutely atrocious unlock system, and the fact that the game NEVER EXPLAINS ANYTHING.  Wanna know what that item there does?  Well TOO BAD because it will not tell you.  Better learn by trial and error and then MEMORIZE the many 100s of items in here.  Or, better yet, get Afterbirth+ (which adds mod support) and just get the item description mod.  Without that... hoboy, better get used to alt-tabbing.\n\nBut then there\'s the unlock system... I hate it.  I *HATE* it.  Look, I grew up in the days of really primitive games... the 2600 and NES for instance.  I do not, and never will, understand modern gaming\'s obsession with achievements and unlocks.  But honestly, even for those who DO understand, this is likely to still be a massive source of frustration.  SO MANY FREAKING THINGS are locked behind arbitrary and often irritating nonsense, some of which genuinely does require that the RNG be very kind to you.  Other things are just stupidly annoying, like trying to beat X final boss with The Lost (a challenge character who dies if you look at him too hard).  Or doing ANYTHING with Jacob and Esau (from Repentance) who are fun enough, but who DO NOT work well with unlocks, as the game is not formatted for their bizarre dual hitbox.  An absolutely astonishing amount of things require that you unlock them before using them, and that is... irritating.  It is by far my biggest complaint with the game.\n\nAlso, there are expansions!  Great stuff really.  Afterbirth is pretty basic... it is MOAR STUFF, lots of fun things.  Afterbirth+ also adds MOAR STUFF, but is truly about modding the game.  You can customize your experience and play it how YOU want to!  People have come up with some incredibly creative and fun things.  One thing to note: you MUST have Afterbirth+ to use Repentance.\n\nAnd Repentance itself is, to me, the best of all.  It is Antibirth integrated officially into the game, with way more added on top.  And like I said, it rebalances EVERYTHING.  OP broken things are nerfed, but even moreso, about a bazillion items got buffed.  The game is far harder, and there are alternate levels, even more endings, and ALL of the content is just SO FREAKING GOOD.\n\nOne thing I do want to mention though:  particularly with Repentance, this game is at its best when you DONT just stick to ""the meta"" (which is frankly something I say about all roguelikes).  EXPERIMENT with the different items.  Despite what some players may say, I genuinely think there are very, very few ACTUALLY bad items in the game.  Like, less than 10.  There are certainly some situational items out there (and deciding when to take something and when NOT to is a big part of the game!) but that sure doesnt make them bad... learn when they work well, and when they dont.  USE EVERYTHING... even if you\'ve used it before and it seemed bad.  Again, this is seriously advice for the entire genre.  But this DLC *really* ups the need to approach it this way, if you want the best experience and the most fun.\n\nAnd dont be afraid of losing.  Dont let it bother you when it happens.  Again, good advice for the entire genre, not just this.\n\nThere is honestly sooo much more I could say about this game, and almost all of it is positive.  But you know, Steam character limit.\n\nOne way or another... it is fantastic.  One of the best.  And the DLC just makes it way better.  It does have a couple of odd issues, sure, but those can be fixed in many cases (with the DLCs) and for those that cant be fixed, well... the rest is just so darned good that those problems get a pass.\n\nJust amazing.

I won't go too in depth with the story or anything but what is a simple story turns into something way more sinister as you keep playing. the game has multiple endings which each tell a part of the story and let me tell you, there are a lot of endings, you get a new one each time you complete a run however later on you will need to do more than just finish a run to achieve the last few endings, some endings will require you to get certain items but you won't need to worry about that until much later on.\n\njust like other roguelike games, when you die, you lose everything and have to restart from the beginning however there are items that can be obtained which allow you to die more than once but I've only ever got those on rare occasions. you may not like it at first because of the whole 1 life thing but just keep playing and you'll get better, that's how i went about playing this anyway and it's one of my favourite games of all time now"", '@edmundmcmillen You litte F**ker\nYou made a shit of piece with your trash Issac it’s f**King Bad this trash game I will become back my money I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker', 'very becoming back of money', 'phenomenal game, enjoyable experience, tons of items and overall great.....', 'funny crying child the video game', 'one of the best games i have played<3 wish i found this earlier', ""I'm a huge Legend of Zelda fan so I may be biased in enjoying this game.

I won't go too in depth with the story or anything but what is a simple story turns into something way more sinister as you keep playing. the game has multiple endings which each tell a part of the story and let me tell you, there are a lot of endings, you get a new one each time you complete a run however later on you will need to do more than just finish a run to achieve the last few endings, some endings will require you to get certain items but you won't need to worry about that until much later on.\n\njust like other roguelike games, when you die, you lose everything and have to restart from the beginning however there are items that can be obtained which allow you to die more than once but I've only ever got those on rare occasions. you may not like it at first because of the whole 1 life thing but just keep playing and you'll get better, that's how i went about playing this anyway and it's one of my favourite games of all time now"", '@edmundmcmillen You litte F**ker\nYou made a shit of piece with your trash Issac it’s f**King Bad this trash game I will become back my money I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker', 'very becoming back of money', 'phenomenal game, enjoyable experience, tons of items and overall great.....', 'funny crying child the video game', 'one of the best games i have played<3 wish i found this earlier', ""I'm a huge Legend of Zelda fan so I may be biased in enjoying this game.

I'll play it again just to experience it again, because in all my years of playing across every console generation from all 3 brands from NES to the current gen and PC for nearly 30 years, likely approaching the completion of 1000 different video games, Hollow Knight is my indisputable favorite."", ""Not for everyone since it's full of bugs :)"", 'Hollow Knight is a deeply moody game that sits on the threshhold of souls-like and metroidvania, taking aspects from both genres into one game. It is also a game that has no desire to hold back punches, and gets remarkably difficult in some of its optional content, demanding a level of mastery from the player in both platforming and combat. If you\'re looking for an \'easy\' game, or a game that guides you in any degree beyond dialogues and looking at a map, then Hollow Knight is not for you.\n\nHollow Knight places you in the shows of a little bug, running around with a sword in a lost bug-kingdom. Soon, you get caught up in the goings on of that ancient place, as it falls to the grips of the ""Corruption"", a glowing, ghostly alien orange light that seems to infect bugs and turn them into insane, mindless creatures, but also offering them incredible strength. A taller beetle named Hornet becomes your sometimes-guide, sometimes rival through the area, along with other NPCs you\'ll come across. It\'s again, very similar to seeing the different NPCs throughout the Dark Souls game, and the comparisons come easy and often. You learn about the story in small cutscenes, snippets of dialogue, and item descriptions - something which likely sounds familiar by now.\n\nThe game has you roaming around the world, and swiftly gives you access to fast travel, and equipment to make traversing the world easier. Over time, you\'ll get access to double jumps, wall climbing, dashes, and more, giving you very swift movement throughout the world - though as always, backtracking will be happening, especially for those looking for high percentage clears. Combat is fast, and enemies generally have 0 i-frames whatsoever, meaning combat can be as greedy as you want it to be - something which will quickly get you kiled against the game\'s many bosses. Various battle techniques will become apparent, such as using your sword in the air to ""pogo"" off of enemies and spikes to bounce endlessly off their heads, or off of the spikes. This technique becomes mandatory later on for some content, so learn it early and use it constantly. Magic is very powerful, and I found great success using equipment (""Charms"") that boosted my magic power early on, later transitioning into a pure sword (""Nail"") focused build for very rapid, long range melee attacks.\n\nThe music and sound effects are wonderful, especially in the Deepnest, a downright spooky and spine-tingling area of the game. While jump scares aren\'t built into the game, there are several points where the game works to make your skin crawl - but just as many other places where it wants you to admire an ancient kingdom, deep, deep underground, covered in dust but in many ways unharmed by time. Every area ha a color pallette unique to it, and area transitions are readily identifiable - at all times the player is alwys perfectly aware of where they are, and how areas connect to each other, which is critical for a metroidvania. It\'s also doubly crucial, as seeing where you are on the minimap actually requires you to use a Charm equipment slot, which you can only do at a bench/""Bonfire"". This is a controversial decision, and I\'ll openly admit I spent the vast majority of the game with it equipped to make my life easier.\n\nThere is a very large amount of sequence breaking that can occur throughout the game. It is wildly open even from the very start, and openly welcomes attempts to circumvent its usual progression. For those who play metroidvanias to do things like that, as long as you\'ve got the skill and guts to pull it off, Hollow Knight is willing to accomodate. There is also a vast amount of optional content in the game, both story related, and non-main story, in the form of several DLCs, including boss rushes, and an entire side story about a mysterious carnival. The game also commits my least favorite thing about metroidvanias, which is ""invisible walls with nothing around to point out that you can walk through them"", so be ready to press against walls from time to time, looking for side entries and special hidden areas.\n\nI would recommend Hollow Knight to anyone looking for a thoughtful, and challenging Metroidvania, especially for anyone who is willing to put in the time to do all of the optional and extra content - there is a wealth of things to accomplish and see, and it\'d be a shame to leave it half done.', 'wait, you dont play as the hollow knight?', ""played it for a bit, it's alright."", 'boner', ""One of the most fun games i've ever played! :)\nIt's very difficult and when you accomplish something,it always feels rewarding!\nGo out there and make me proud,knights of Hollownest! :)"", ""I have a love-hate relationship with this game.\n\nI've sunk 30 hours into it already and still only have a 70% completion score.\nThe problem is, only about 10 of those hours or so were actually spent exploring new areas, fighting new bosses, learning new skills... you know, the fun stuff.\n\nThe majority of your playtime in this game is going to be backtracking. And I get it, it's a Metroidvania. But this is too much. Too unclear. Too many dead-ends. You check your map and see there were fifteen paths where an obstacle blocked you, but there's no way you're going to remember what exactly each obstacle was. So when you FINALLY stumble upon a new ability, you have to recheck all your old obstructions, one-by-one. Powerups/other useful items are given way too infrequently. Even after 30 hours of gameplay, the story is still pretty cryptic.\n\nBasically there's too much backtracking. My sense of direction in games may not be the best but come on. The majority of your gameplay shouldn't be wandering through the same areas swatting the same mooks you've had to encounter one hundred million times over and over and over again.\n\nThe actual gameplay (when you're actually encountering something new, that is) is amazing and crisp.

Very ambiguous, kinda reminds me of another novella main character I love, only much cuter and far more benign on the surface (nothing is said about their past before the trip down into Mt. Ebott)...and the fact that everyone refers to the main character as they/them is a really good idea considering the main character is the 'silent protagonist' type (is there really a protagonist here?).\n\nWhat name did I give the main character? 'Jess'. Not sure why you actually care, but yeah.\n\nThere's a lot more I could say, but it would be considered prattling.\n\nSo, play it. It's worth getting.

The Game is meant for the story, pay close attention to it, and make yourself get lost within the world of UNDERTALE.  The Characters are deeply Fleshed out and so emotive, all are different, for instance, undyne is a Fearless warrior, she Mimics the ""Arnold Schwarzenegger"" Stereotype, however learning more about her shows her past and how incredible it was.   another example is alphys, a very nerdy Girl who has made HUGE mistakes in the past that i\'m not going to get into for your sake.\n\nBut let\'s Address the Elephant in the room, sans.   Ohhh boy, this is probably the reason you ever Read this Review in the First place, or even looked at the store page, you\'ve already all seen his Fight because of all the memes and i\'m sorry to say, but seeing that fight means you\'ve already seen one of the most shocking spoilers in the game.  Basically, sans is one of the most confusing characters in the game, only being beaten by [REDACTED] which is literally only very rarely ever found in people\'s runs ever.   \n\nI can\'t get into every aspect of why this game is perfect, but let\'s just say, if you\'re bored, depressed, or have any mental issue ever, i recommend this game HIGHLY.', 'sans', 'IT IS AMAZING']"

I mean, the mode couldn't fix the fundamental problem with loading and switching scenes between in game and steam VR loading scenes.

I\'ve played almost 300 hours.\n2) Said $8 buys you a fair number of zones to explore, all of which scale to your character level - go anywhere, do anything, right from the start.\n3) The community is usually friendly and helpful. You meet the occasional troll, they become more common as you explore further from starting areas, but more or less people are willing to provide helpful information if you ask in zone chat which is more than can be said about several other MMO\'s I\'ve played.\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n1) [b] Crafting: [/b]\n   I\'ve played almost 300 hours but have accomplished almost nothing in game. I can\'t even craft a suit of what is considered ENTRY level armor having reached max level. With research speed maxed out it still takes around 12 real world days to research one piece of gear enough to craft a set item, you can research three items at once (with max research) and there are nine slots to fill for an ""entry"" level build to start powering up towards ""end game"" content. This means roughly 36 real life days of time must pass (likely more, as research may finish while you sleep, etc) to make your own stuff.\n\nYou also can\'t craft, research, or disassemble jewelry unless you buy the Summerset Chapter, or pay for ESO+ which leads me to my next topic.\n\nOh, and if you instead want to try and buy gear (which is insanely expensive to those starting out) there is no centralized market or Auction House. Instead you have individual Guild Traders that will let you browse items posted by the members of that Guild. This can be anything in game that isn\'t Bound to your character or account. With hundreds of Traders, that can have pretty much any item under the sun, spread out across all the zones in the game you have to rely on third party websites and addons to search for items that may or may not still be present by the time you travel to whichever zone and town that Guild Trader is in. It turns what should be a three minute shopping trip in to a three hour struggle.\n\n2) [b] Monetization: [/b]\n    I\'m all for folks getting paid for their work, however publishers tend to push that to the extremes for the sake of their share holders. Monetization in this game feels scummy, bordering on predatory. You want to increase the speed of your mount, how much your mount can help you carry, or how long it can run? Great! Wait 3,600 real life hours (150 days, if you don\'t miss a single minute of upgrade time, but more realistically 180 days) to reach max attributes or pay real world currency (RWC) for instant upgrades. \n\nYou want to hold all those crafting ingredients so you can (attempt to) make things? Great! Pay for ESO+ so you have access to a crafting storage bag, or constantly be throwing things away as character bag space is limited to 60 slots to start, upgraded with a non-inconsequential amount of gold or (you guessed it!) RWC to 140 slots which sounds like a lot, but for Provisioning (making foods and drinks) alone there are 50 different ingredients. Say you buy the first six bag upgrades to save 2/3rd the gold cost, you\'d still spend 2,000 Crowns (~$20 USD) PER CHARACTER to upgrade your bags the last two ranks.\n\nThe list goes on but the worst of all (in my opinion) Crown Crates - loot boxes which provide random items upon opening. To make it even more enjoyable those Crown Crate items can be scrapped in to an alternate currency, only obtainable (to my knowledge) by opening Crates, which are used for purchasing other items from the in-game store. Granted, I haven\'t delved too deeply in to that aspect of things as I do not have any desire to waste money on in-game gambling for pixels but to lock things behind a currency that requires you to gamble seems rapacious.\n\n3) [b] Repetative: [/b]\n   Yes, it\'s an MMO so it\'s mostly what you make of it however each of your characters has to go through the same Public Dungeons, Delves, Quests, and Zones. Delves, Dungeons and Zone exploration are essentially required to collect Sky Shards which award extra Skill Points (used to learn combat or crafting skills) outside of the Skill points you receive while leveling. You get 64 Skill Points in total by the time you reach level 50 (max character level) however crafting skills alone can require well over 100 Points (ignoring some of the traits I find less useful) meaning you will spend hours and hours grinding. But hey, once you collect all the Sky Shards from a zone you can use RWC to buy those same shard unlocks on an alt to save time. It\'ll only cost you $5 per zone you\'ve already cleared and with a dozen or so major zones only $60 per character. Yay?\n\n[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]\nAll in all, for $8 it\'s not a bad game though it does feel like any old generic MMO with an Elder Scrolls skin stretched over top of it. I personally refuse to spend a single penny more on anything else related to this game even though ESO+ feels almost mandatory (+10% gold, XP gains, crafting progression and research, double bank storage space, the ability to actually customize your armor appearance, and more) if you want to actually play without dipping in to your bag every 5 minutes to make space. I am however going to leave this as a negative review as their monetization offends me to such a degree that an otherwise okay game can not be something I recommend to others wholeheartedly but you can\'t go wrong for $8.\n\nEdited: Typos, I wrote this late at night so forgive me.', ""ESO is a fantastic MMO. The community is great, and the game is just stunning. I am an old WOW player from the vanilla days and I remember just going to hilltops or on top of buildings and being in aw of the graphics. I get that feeling again in ESO. Sometimes I just watch the sun set over the water while casting a line in the water. here are some bullet points of why i love ESO.\n\n- use any weapon you want. You want to be a greatsword wielding mage with light armor pants but a heavy helm? ok. sure. you want to craft EVERYTHING? ok. You can get all the crafting lines!\n-such a pretty game as I said above. A well put together world \n-quests are not boring like go and kill 20 murlocs. There is always a neat story of why you are doing things, and its never just go kill mobs of X monsters. I spent a while last night just pickpocketing people and running from the law to get into the thieves guild. then I killed some people for the assassins' guild. want to just read books? go to a bookshelf and open one up! \n-LORE. lots of lovely LORE\n- mostly free. People that complain about expansions costing money don't know how the world works. You can play this game (besides the actual game cost) for free. there is no real need for paying the month script fees unless you want to get cosmetic items for your or your house.

I\'ve played almost 300 hours.\n2) Said $8 buys you a fair number of zones to explore, all of which scale to your character level - go anywhere, do anything, right from the start.\n3) The community is usually friendly and helpful. You meet the occasional troll, they become more common as you explore further from starting areas, but more or less people are willing to provide helpful information if you ask in zone chat which is more than can be said about several other MMO\'s I\'ve played.\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n1) [b] Crafting: [/b]\n   I\'ve played almost 300 hours but have accomplished almost nothing in game. I can\'t even craft a suit of what is considered ENTRY level armor having reached max level. With research speed maxed out it still takes around 12 real world days to research one piece of gear enough to craft a set item, you can research three items at once (with max research) and there are nine slots to fill for an ""entry"" level build to start powering up towards ""end game"" content. This means roughly 36 real life days of time must pass (likely more, as research may finish while you sleep, etc) to make your own stuff.\n\nYou also can\'t craft, research, or disassemble jewelry unless you buy the Summerset Chapter, or pay for ESO+ which leads me to my next topic.\n\nOh, and if you instead want to try and buy gear (which is insanely expensive to those starting out) there is no centralized market or Auction House. Instead you have individual Guild Traders that will let you browse items posted by the members of that Guild. This can be anything in game that isn\'t Bound to your character or account. With hundreds of Traders, that can have pretty much any item under the sun, spread out across all the zones in the game you have to rely on third party websites and addons to search for items that may or may not still be present by the time you travel to whichever zone and town that Guild Trader is in. It turns what should be a three minute shopping trip in to a three hour struggle.\n\n2) [b] Monetization: [/b]\n    I\'m all for folks getting paid for their work, however publishers tend to push that to the extremes for the sake of their share holders. Monetization in this game feels scummy, bordering on predatory. You want to increase the speed of your mount, how much your mount can help you carry, or how long it can run? Great! Wait 3,600 real life hours (150 days, if you don\'t miss a single minute of upgrade time, but more realistically 180 days) to reach max attributes or pay real world currency (RWC) for instant upgrades. \n\nYou want to hold all those crafting ingredients so you can (attempt to) make things? Great! Pay for ESO+ so you have access to a crafting storage bag, or constantly be throwing things away as character bag space is limited to 60 slots to start, upgraded with a non-inconsequential amount of gold or (you guessed it!) RWC to 140 slots which sounds like a lot, but for Provisioning (making foods and drinks) alone there are 50 different ingredients. Say you buy the first six bag upgrades to save 2/3rd the gold cost, you\'d still spend 2,000 Crowns (~$20 USD) PER CHARACTER to upgrade your bags the last two ranks.\n\nThe list goes on but the worst of all (in my opinion) Crown Crates - loot boxes which provide random items upon opening. To make it even more enjoyable those Crown Crate items can be scrapped in to an alternate currency, only obtainable (to my knowledge) by opening Crates, which are used for purchasing other items from the in-game store. Granted, I haven\'t delved too deeply in to that aspect of things as I do not have any desire to waste money on in-game gambling for pixels but to lock things behind a currency that requires you to gamble seems rapacious.\n\n3) [b] Repetative: [/b]\n   Yes, it\'s an MMO so it\'s mostly what you make of it however each of your characters has to go through the same Public Dungeons, Delves, Quests, and Zones. Delves, Dungeons and Zone exploration are essentially required to collect Sky Shards which award extra Skill Points (used to learn combat or crafting skills) outside of the Skill points you receive while leveling. You get 64 Skill Points in total by the time you reach level 50 (max character level) however crafting skills alone can require well over 100 Points (ignoring some of the traits I find less useful) meaning you will spend hours and hours grinding. But hey, once you collect all the Sky Shards from a zone you can use RWC to buy those same shard unlocks on an alt to save time. It\'ll only cost you $5 per zone you\'ve already cleared and with a dozen or so major zones only $60 per character. Yay?\n\n[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]\nAll in all, for $8 it\'s not a bad game though it does feel like any old generic MMO with an Elder Scrolls skin stretched over top of it. I personally refuse to spend a single penny more on anything else related to this game even though ESO+ feels almost mandatory (+10% gold, XP gains, crafting progression and research, double bank storage space, the ability to actually customize your armor appearance, and more) if you want to actually play without dipping in to your bag every 5 minutes to make space. I am however going to leave this as a negative review as their monetization offends me to such a degree that an otherwise okay game can not be something I recommend to others wholeheartedly but you can\'t go wrong for $8.\n\nEdited: Typos, I wrote this late at night so forgive me.', ""ESO is a fantastic MMO.

Try your BEST to FLANK the enemy. don\'t attack them head on. come at them from the sides, above, or even behind them, if one tactic dosen\'t work... Try something else. the fight is dynamic, just like you!  5) Finally, LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of your weapons, it WILL take time.\n\n\nP.S. Feel free to add my on steam or PS2 (ingame) the name i listed is my primary although if you want i can tell you the others via PM or steam chat.\n\nP.P.S. I added some tips my teamates and friends gave me. some others on Youtube, like Wrel (Dev) Nico101, Joshino, and others have also said some of these tips. If you want to know more about the game look them up on youtube Especially Wrel, as he\'s a developer. Nico101 I\'d recoment to Older audiences, as there is some ""Humor"" that younger audiences may find offensive or dont understand. (he and his team swear a bit aswell) i do squad ops with them and its mostly moments of WTF?! and general fun. Joshino and Wrel are a great choice to see if you want to Learn more about the game, its mechanics and also for general info/guides for weapons or tactics. \n\nNow all this is simply my PERSONAL opinion, while i agree that some others may not agree with me, i hold my opinions of the game and the players in fair judgment. \n\nAlso, if you have any ideas for tips/tricks/unspoken rules/etc. post them in the comments. I will add them to the list and give you credit. feel free do discuss this game in comments below.

Where do I even start with you?\n\nOkay, let\'s start with the noticeable stuff first:\n- The abyssmal performance:\nThe performance has been quite bad since launch. After years of patches, it still hasn\'t really gotten any better. The one trick they pulled was to label the old ""high"" settings to be the new ""ultra"" settings. I think you can see where this is going...\n- The weapons:\nA billion iterations of every weapon there is, with little to no differences between the guns themselves. Originally the factions were designed to have strengths and weaknesses. Now there are guns which every faction can use, which have no apparent weakness.\n- The lags:\nOh god, the lags. Dying behind corners is pretty normal here. Also, other forms of glitching around, bad pop-in (like literally other players popping in 2 metres in front of you... yes, enemies aswell)\n\nI could list several additional problems this game has, but I\'m just tired.

This is a very special experience, I can’t think of another FPS that is as ambitious, varied, and outrageous in its dedication to all out chaotic war as this game. Thousands, and I mean thousands of real people at sitting at their computers all across the world battle in this never ending sci fi conflict from a first person perspective, all in glorious real time, and for the most part, it works. It’s astonishing to stare across a field at a giant group of advancing enemy infantry, easily larger than even the largest Battlefield server, snap to iron sights, and fire into the group and score a kill, only to get run over from behind by one of a hundred tanks cresting over the hill, firing in all directions like maniacs. The game is an MMO, but just the very fact that it still manages to feel like a standard FPS with decent controls and shooting mechanics is a grand achievement. Planetside 2 feels, at times, like the perfect game I wanted as a little kid while going “pew pew” with dozens of little plastic army men.\n\nLike other MMOs, you can join an outfit (guild) and fight for one of three distinct factions. The scary red space communists (guns are weak but shoot fast), the freedom loving space Americans (guns are strong but shoot slow), and the spiritual xenophile space hippies (laser guns). These factions are engaged in an eternal conflict over several continents, and the game centers around various control points. Choose a class ranging from the vital medic to the jetpacking Light Assault and help out your team crush the enemy forces. The size of each continent is mind boggling, and while large stretches are usually unused for long periods of time, it is easy to find conflict zones and jump straight in by the game’s intuitive map system. See all of those flashing booms? Shit’s going down there, get in the meat grinder, soldier!\n\nThe land and air vehicles are easy to operate, and the infantry controls are familiar if you’ve played any recent FPS. There is a ton of variety in how the gameplay unfolds. One minute you are firing at distant targets in a barren desert from a tank’s turret, the next you could be dropped from a hovering Galaxy troop carrier into the thick of an intense CQB firefight. However, there are definitely long boring stretches of inactivity like in other MMOs, boring car rides or endless sprints to the objective that can become pretty grating over time. Thankfully, you can always kill yourself to respawn somewhere closer, or spawn on a mobile spawn truck known as the Sunderer, so if you’re an impatient type action is never too far away.\n\nThe game unfortunately isn’t perfect. Performance is all over the place, despite having a good system expect things to slow down in some of the more hectic combat moments, which is expected since the game is trying to render hundreds of people shooting each other. The F2P system isn’t too bad, the starting guns are definitely viable in combat, but in order to get another weapon or even to unlock a new attachment can feel very grindy at times. Players who spend a ton of money will definitely have an advantage over you in a 1v1 situation since they have access to more gadgets, scopes, etc. than you do, but since the battles are so chaotic and packed with people, this is rarely an issue. \n\nPlanetside 2 is an ambitious game that truly makes you feel like you are a small cog in a giant sci fi battle. I feel as if many multiplayer FPS games are becoming more and more obsessed with making every player feel like a cool guy special forces operator, but Planetside 2 basically says, “You don’t matter, you’re one of hundreds of dumb grunts running around and you are most likely going to die real quick.” I really enjoy this and I wished more developers would work towards making a similar MMOFPS like this of our dreams. Imagine an MMOFPS set in Europe during WW2 (Not that Heroes and Generals shits), now that would be something I really like. Imagine Allied forces landing in player controlled LCVPs, while Axis Luftwafe strafe the beaches, and Panzer divisions massing for a counter attack. Now THAT's my dream video game. \n\nPlanetside 2 is definitely worth trying out, it’s free, so why not?"", ""I love this game! I play it on the PS4 a lot more than I should, honestly! It's a great game for those looking for a big open battlefield! 7/10, would play again."", ""Planetside 2 has ESCALATED to a whole new level.\n\nI'm not wrong though, it's pretty awesome."", ""I played this game for 75 days (that is 1800 hours) so far. I'm beginning to get into it."", 'Very Fun Game I have played it it gets boring if you play it everyday but yeah its a pretty good game', ""Best free 2 play game I have ever played, It actually feels like a battle in a war, there can be sooo many players in one place at a time it's really is fun and unique unlike other games and it's also free so no reason why not to get it."", 'Great game with incredable large scale battles, or small 10 on 10 fights for a small outpost. Great weapon diversity and abilities which and unique dynamics to each fight. Would highly recommend everyone to try it for free.', 'This is one of the most difficult FPS games I\'ve ever played simply because of the sheer number or people who can end up shooting at you because of the smallest mistakes... This game puts the OP in ""Teamwork OP"" because a well oiled outfit that has its tactics down can storm a base and turn the tide of a battle even when outnumbered. This game is not pay 2 win but it WILL require you to grind to acquire the gear you want if you\'re not interested in investing some money for DB cash. There are many class unlocks that cannot be bought and must be earned. \n\nAt this point of the game (like 4 years running now) there are many vets on both sides with lots of gear/weapons unlocked and it can seem daunting for a new player. However the unlockable weapons tend to be sidegrades rather than an outright upgrade, meaning that the stats of the new weapon won\'t necessarily be better than the last but it may be better for different circumstances i.e. CQC, or Long/mid range fights. Each weapon excels in its own area.\n\nI Believe there is even an xp bonus for soldiers under BR (Battle Rank) 15 to help you get some quick Cert points. I suggest medic for new players as you can earn a TON of xp without having to kill anyone and medics are SUPER useful in big or small fights.', ""It's a decent game if there's a lot of players, but the PC version is dying, over the last week I've been on the U.S. West servers and there's never more than 75 people on, for one whole night there was only 3- 8 players at a time. If you want to play this game and enjoy it try it on a console, I played on PS4 periodically for the last year or 2 and it's always had a much larger player base during that period"", 'well', 'I have a few hours logged and it is by far my favorite game.  I may drift away for a bit but I always come back.  This is everything you want in a war game.   You can change a battle by yourself or roll over your enemies in a 40 man platoon.  I grinded almost everything out f2p but ended up buying some camos so I could look sexy when I killed people.   \n', ""Pretty fun game.

Try your BEST to FLANK the enemy. don\'t attack them head on. come at them from the sides, above, or even behind them, if one tactic dosen\'t work... Try something else. the fight is dynamic, just like you!  5) Finally, LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of your weapons, it WILL take time.\n\n\nP.S. Feel free to add my on steam or PS2 (ingame) the name i listed is my primary although if you want i can tell you the others via PM or steam chat.\n\nP.P.S. I added some tips my teamates and friends gave me. some others on Youtube, like Wrel (Dev) Nico101, Joshino, and others have also said some of these tips. If you want to know more about the game look them up on youtube Especially Wrel, as he\'s a developer. Nico101 I\'d recoment to Older audiences, as there is some ""Humor"" that younger audiences may find offensive or dont understand. (he and his team swear a bit aswell) i do squad ops with them and its mostly moments of WTF?! and general fun. Joshino and Wrel are a great choice to see if you want to Learn more about the game, its mechanics and also for general info/guides for weapons or tactics. \n\nNow all this is simply my PERSONAL opinion, while i agree that some others may not agree with me, i hold my opinions of the game and the players in fair judgment. \n\nAlso, if you have any ideas for tips/tricks/unspoken rules/etc. post them in the comments.

Each faction must capture control points in order to gain control of the planet. There are 6 different soldier classes which allow for large differences in personal gameplay. Give it a try because it is free.\n\n This game was curated for PC Beta Gaming - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG"", 'Old review below.\n\nOh man, Planetside... Where do I even start with you?\n\nOkay, let\'s start with the noticeable stuff first:\n- The abyssmal performance:\nThe performance has been quite bad since launch. After years of patches, it still hasn\'t really gotten any better. The one trick they pulled was to label the old ""high"" settings to be the new ""ultra"" settings. I think you can see where this is going...\n- The weapons:\nA billion iterations of every weapon there is, with little to no differences between the guns themselves. Originally the factions were designed to have strengths and weaknesses. Now there are guns which every faction can use, which have no apparent weakness.\n- The lags:\nOh god, the lags. Dying behind corners is pretty normal here. Also, other forms of glitching around, bad pop-in (like literally other players popping in 2 metres in front of you... yes, enemies aswell)\n\nI could list several additional problems this game has, but I\'m just tired. There is no hope here,\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n\nThe game can be quite frustrating at the beginning until you get the ropes. Then it starts to be incerasingly more fun. I\'d recommend getting into an outfit as soon as possible and participate in their squads, it will enhance your experience.', ""You thought Battlefield was war.

This is a very special experience, I can’t think of another FPS that is as ambitious, varied, and outrageous in its dedication to all out chaotic war as this game. Thousands, and I mean thousands of real people at sitting at their computers all across the world battle in this never ending sci fi conflict from a first person perspective, all in glorious real time, and for the most part, it works. It’s astonishing to stare across a field at a giant group of advancing enemy infantry, easily larger than even the largest Battlefield server, snap to iron sights, and fire into the group and score a kill, only to get run over from behind by one of a hundred tanks cresting over the hill, firing in all directions like maniacs. The game is an MMO, but just the very fact that it still manages to feel like a standard FPS with decent controls and shooting mechanics is a grand achievement. Planetside 2 feels, at times, like the perfect game I wanted as a little kid while going “pew pew” with dozens of little plastic army men.\n\nLike other MMOs, you can join an outfit (guild) and fight for one of three distinct factions. The scary red space communists (guns are weak but shoot fast), the freedom loving space Americans (guns are strong but shoot slow), and the spiritual xenophile space hippies (laser guns). These factions are engaged in an eternal conflict over several continents, and the game centers around various control points. Choose a class ranging from the vital medic to the jetpacking Light Assault and help out your team crush the enemy forces. The size of each continent is mind boggling, and while large stretches are usually unused for long periods of time, it is easy to find conflict zones and jump straight in by the game’s intuitive map system. See all of those flashing booms? Shit’s going down there, get in the meat grinder, soldier!\n\nThe land and air vehicles are easy to operate, and the infantry controls are familiar if you’ve played any recent FPS. There is a ton of variety in how the gameplay unfolds. One minute you are firing at distant targets in a barren desert from a tank’s turret, the next you could be dropped from a hovering Galaxy troop carrier into the thick of an intense CQB firefight. However, there are definitely long boring stretches of inactivity like in other MMOs, boring car rides or endless sprints to the objective that can become pretty grating over time. Thankfully, you can always kill yourself to respawn somewhere closer, or spawn on a mobile spawn truck known as the Sunderer, so if you’re an impatient type action is never too far away.\n\nThe game unfortunately isn’t perfect. Performance is all over the place, despite having a good system expect things to slow down in some of the more hectic combat moments, which is expected since the game is trying to render hundreds of people shooting each other. The F2P system isn’t too bad, the starting guns are definitely viable in combat, but in order to get another weapon or even to unlock a new attachment can feel very grindy at times. Players who spend a ton of money will definitely have an advantage over you in a 1v1 situation since they have access to more gadgets, scopes, etc. than you do, but since the battles are so chaotic and packed with people, this is rarely an issue. \n\nPlanetside 2 is an ambitious game that truly makes you feel like you are a small cog in a giant sci fi battle. I feel as if many multiplayer FPS games are becoming more and more obsessed with making every player feel like a cool guy special forces operator, but Planetside 2 basically says, “You don’t matter, you’re one of hundreds of dumb grunts running around and you are most likely going to die real quick.” I really enjoy this and I wished more developers would work towards making a similar MMOFPS like this of our dreams. Imagine an MMOFPS set in Europe during WW2 (Not that Heroes and Generals shits), now that would be something I really like. Imagine Allied forces landing in player controlled LCVPs, while Axis Luftwafe strafe the beaches, and Panzer divisions massing for a counter attack. Now THAT's my dream video game. \n\nPlanetside 2 is definitely worth trying out, it’s free, so why not?"", ""I love this game! I play it on the PS4 a lot more than I should, honestly! It's a great game for those looking for a big open battlefield! 7/10, would play again."", ""Planetside 2 has ESCALATED to a whole new level.\n\nI'm not wrong though, it's pretty awesome."", ""I played this game for 75 days (that is 1800 hours) so far. I'm beginning to get into it."", 'Very Fun Game I have played it it gets boring if you play it everyday but yeah its a pretty good game', ""Best free 2 play game I have ever played, It actually feels like a battle in a war, there can be sooo many players in one place at a time it's really is fun and unique unlike other games and it's also free so no reason why not to get it."", 'Great game with incredable large scale battles, or small 10 on 10 fights for a small outpost. Great weapon diversity and abilities which and unique dynamics to each fight. Would highly recommend everyone to try it for free.', 'This is one of the most difficult FPS games I\'ve ever played simply because of the sheer number or people who can end up shooting at you because of the smallest mistakes... This game puts the OP in ""Teamwork OP"" because a well oiled outfit that has its tactics down can storm a base and turn the tide of a battle even when outnumbered. This game is not pay 2 win but it WILL require you to grind to acquire the gear you want if you\'re not interested in investing some money for DB cash. There are many class unlocks that cannot be bought and must be earned. \n\nAt this point of the game (like 4 years running now) there are many vets on both sides with lots of gear/weapons unlocked and it can seem daunting for a new player. However the unlockable weapons tend to be sidegrades rather than an outright upgrade, meaning that the stats of the new weapon won\'t necessarily be better than the last but it may be better for different circumstances i.e. CQC, or Long/mid range fights. Each weapon excels in its own area.\n\nI Believe there is even an xp bonus for soldiers under BR (Battle Rank) 15 to help you get some quick Cert points. I suggest medic for new players as you can earn a TON of xp without having to kill anyone and medics are SUPER useful in big or small fights.', ""It's a decent game if there's a lot of players, but the PC version is dying, over the last week I've been on the U.S. West servers and there's never more than 75 people on, for one whole night there was only 3- 8 players at a time.

FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Massively%20Multiplayer,39210,"[""Look, you can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it. It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it. You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really good.\n\nWhat I *am* going to try to do is let you know about a few things before you buy that I don't see a lot of people telling new players.\n\nFirst, and maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*\n- What does this mean?\nIf you buy FFXIV from Square Enix directly you can only buy future expansions from them and only them. This means that if steam is having a sale on the expansion you cannot participate in it. The same goes with Steam. If you buy the game on Steam you can only buy future expansions from steam and not Square. This can be frustrating as I've seen people buy their game from the wrong place and waste money. Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.\n\nSecond, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different\n- What does this mean?\nThere are two types of subscriptions. \nThe first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.\nThe second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. \nThere are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. \n\nThird, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character\n- What does this mean?\nEvery character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.\n\nOverall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out."", 'did you know that FINAL FANTASY XIV™ has a free trial up to level 60 that includes the entire base game as well as the critically acclaimed first expansion Heavensward™ with no time restriction', 'This game presents itself for a large part of the main story as a single player RPG experience; the story is qualitywise comparable to single player Final Fantasy games which – in my opinion – is already an achievement. What really sets aside this game is the love for detail however. I was not expecting a world so full of life, colorful characters and well written plots. Especially the side adventures feature lots of comical elements.\n\nThe combat system feels refreshing. You get visual announcements to know what to do and where not stand. Learning by doing is often a welcome approach. You get extra rewards for having someone in your group who has not done the content yet.\n\nThe jobs in this game start out with a very basic concept but soon develop into a very well rounded and fun toolkit. The cooldown between the skills may make the battle system look slow at first but you keep unlocking skills that build up on those basic concepts in order to be able to create own solutions and approaches for all types of battles. The jobs differ nicely from each other in terms of core gameplay and positioning. All classes can be played on one character at the switch of a weapon and a crystal. Just to mention a few of many: There are summoners who utilize some of the well known summons of previous games to battle, healers who utilize white healing and protective spells to keep the group healthy or certain gunblade wielding tanks who give you a heavy sense of nostalgia. You will be able to unlock a mount in the form of a Chocobo early on who will also join you as a companion in battle. Different roles (damage dealer, healer or tank) can be taught to your Chocobo as skills. The chocobo is customisable in terms of color and gear (purely cosmetic).\n\nGroups for content can be accessed by a search function or self-created. The size of the group (4 up to 24) depends heavily on the amount of time and effort you would like to invest. Queue times usually are not too long and can easily be bypassed by picking up a small adventure or two on the side. Hard content with different levels of progression is present in this game but not mandatory meaning that if you really want a challenge you will not have a trouble finding it.\n\nThere even is an amusement park, Gold Saucer, already known to some of you from playing Final Fantasy VII, which can be accessed to play small adventure games or e. g. Triple Triad (just as glorious as in Final Fantasy VIII) or to hang out with friends. You can purchase an appartment or a house which you can fill with self-created or purchased furnishings. You could even shape the layout to your liking. The location can be picked depending on which country you enjoy the most.\n\nOne of the jobs offers access to instruments (for example keyboard, guitar, flute) that can be used to perform. In some of the main cities you can sit down and watch people perform – sometimes even concerts are being held.\n\nFlying is easily acquired in almost every zone by progressing the main story (not early on). Teleporting makes traveling fairly comfortable and easy. Leveling can be done with a variety of questing, dungeons or (non-instanced) world content. With a few weekly challenges you can get secondary jobs up to level swiftly.\n\nThe crafting system is a true gem. There is a variety of professions to pick from (e. g. goldsmith and carpenter). They are easy to pick up and items can be crafted with different qualities. A quality craft requires a certain amount of points to be acquired – this can be done by performing different kinds of rotations (you will pick up skills for this – just like in the jobs – while leveling up). There are also gathering professions that will yield you some of the required materials. Monsters can be avoided by a skill learned at early levels to gather efficiently. Later on you can even use your crafting to help rebuild a city.\n\nThe graphics are pretty and had – in comparison to a few other more current games – quite a low inpact on my system. With mid range components form years ago I could pretty easily play on high to maxed out settings. The animations are fluid and everything you press in combat feels (and looks) impactful.\n\nAnother awesome aspect of this game is the community. It is fairly easy to meet other players who also look for an enjoyable and positive experience. This game features a newbie chat where you can ask questions while playing. Mentors are also part of this chat to help. Becoming a mentor requires quite a bit of work in terms of ingame activies but from what I have seen people treat it as a privilege. Asking for help rarely goes unanswered here at pretty much all times. \n\nThis game can be easily accessed and putting it down for something else was never an issue. Even a small amount of time can provide you with a good experience. I progressed the story in the evenings the last few weeks and was really impressed by how many weekly challenges feel optional instead of mandatory.\n\nA few final words? First of all chapeau for releasing A Realm Reborn and Heavensward as free content (the core game and first expansion). Reading all of the above again this review feels overly positive – so far more than 300 hours in this game have not changed my mind. I wish I would have stumbled earlier upon this gem of a game. The love for detail in pretty much every direction is amazing. Thank you for all the hard work of developing this game over the years.\n\n\ntl;dr: One of the finest RPGs and even single player experiences out there, even though its an MMORPG. Easily accessible. Creative and unique job and crafting system with depth. More than 200 hours of free content.', 'Played WoW for 16 years or so. Switched to FF finally been playing past couple days nonstop.

The fact that you can play with very few restrictions all the way to level 60 is fantastic. It makes it so you really don't have to spend any money on the game to know if you will like it.

Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.\n\nSecond, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different\n- What does this mean?\nThere are two types of subscriptions. \nThe first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.\nThe second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. \nThere are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. \n\nThird, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character\n- What does this mean?\nEvery character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.\n\nOverall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out."", 'did you know that FINAL FANTASY XIV™ has a free trial up to level 60 that includes the entire base game as well as the critically acclaimed first expansion Heavensward™ with no time restriction', 'This game presents itself for a large part of the main story as a single player RPG experience; the story is qualitywise comparable to single player Final Fantasy games which – in my opinion – is already an achievement. What really sets aside this game is the love for detail however. I was not expecting a world so full of life, colorful characters and well written plots. Especially the side adventures feature lots of comical elements.\n\nThe combat system feels refreshing. You get visual announcements to know what to do and where not stand. Learning by doing is often a welcome approach. You get extra rewards for having someone in your group who has not done the content yet.\n\nThe jobs in this game start out with a very basic concept but soon develop into a very well rounded and fun toolkit. The cooldown between the skills may make the battle system look slow at first but you keep unlocking skills that build up on those basic concepts in order to be able to create own solutions and approaches for all types of battles. The jobs differ nicely from each other in terms of core gameplay and positioning. All classes can be played on one character at the switch of a weapon and a crystal. Just to mention a few of many: There are summoners who utilize some of the well known summons of previous games to battle, healers who utilize white healing and protective spells to keep the group healthy or certain gunblade wielding tanks who give you a heavy sense of nostalgia. You will be able to unlock a mount in the form of a Chocobo early on who will also join you as a companion in battle. Different roles (damage dealer, healer or tank) can be taught to your Chocobo as skills. The chocobo is customisable in terms of color and gear (purely cosmetic).\n\nGroups for content can be accessed by a search function or self-created. The size of the group (4 up to 24) depends heavily on the amount of time and effort you would like to invest. Queue times usually are not too long and can easily be bypassed by picking up a small adventure or two on the side. Hard content with different levels of progression is present in this game but not mandatory meaning that if you really want a challenge you will not have a trouble finding it.\n\nThere even is an amusement park, Gold Saucer, already known to some of you from playing Final Fantasy VII, which can be accessed to play small adventure games or e. g. Triple Triad (just as glorious as in Final Fantasy VIII) or to hang out with friends. You can purchase an appartment or a house which you can fill with self-created or purchased furnishings. You could even shape the layout to your liking. The location can be picked depending on which country you enjoy the most.\n\nOne of the jobs offers access to instruments (for example keyboard, guitar, flute) that can be used to perform. In some of the main cities you can sit down and watch people perform – sometimes even concerts are being held.\n\nFlying is easily acquired in almost every zone by progressing the main story (not early on). Teleporting makes traveling fairly comfortable and easy. Leveling can be done with a variety of questing, dungeons or (non-instanced) world content. With a few weekly challenges you can get secondary jobs up to level swiftly.\n\nThe crafting system is a true gem. There is a variety of professions to pick from (e. g. goldsmith and carpenter). They are easy to pick up and items can be crafted with different qualities. A quality craft requires a certain amount of points to be acquired – this can be done by performing different kinds of rotations (you will pick up skills for this – just like in the jobs – while leveling up). There are also gathering professions that will yield you some of the required materials. Monsters can be avoided by a skill learned at early levels to gather efficiently. Later on you can even use your crafting to help rebuild a city.\n\nThe graphics are pretty and had – in comparison to a few other more current games – quite a low inpact on my system. With mid range components form years ago I could pretty easily play on high to maxed out settings. The animations are fluid and everything you press in combat feels (and looks) impactful.\n\nAnother awesome aspect of this game is the community. It is fairly easy to meet other players who also look for an enjoyable and positive experience. This game features a newbie chat where you can ask questions while playing. Mentors are also part of this chat to help. Becoming a mentor requires quite a bit of work in terms of ingame activies but from what I have seen people treat it as a privilege. Asking for help rarely goes unanswered here at pretty much all times. \n\nThis game can be easily accessed and putting it down for something else was never an issue. Even a small amount of time can provide you with a good experience. I progressed the story in the evenings the last few weeks and was really impressed by how many weekly challenges feel optional instead of mandatory.\n\nA few final words? First of all chapeau for releasing A Realm Reborn and Heavensward as free content (the core game and first expansion). Reading all of the above again this review feels overly positive – so far more than 300 hours in this game have not changed my mind. I wish I would have stumbled earlier upon this gem of a game. The love for detail in pretty much every direction is amazing. Thank you for all the hard work of developing this game over the years.\n\n\ntl;dr: One of the finest RPGs and even single player experiences out there, even though its an MMORPG. Easily accessible.

Trove,Massively%20Multiplayer,304050,"['Let me tell an amazing story about what trove what once was compared to what trove is now.\n\nEDIT3: HERE IS A COUNTUP FOR THE TIME THE DEVELOPERS STILL HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO THIS REVIEW.\nhttps://www.tickcounter.com/countup/22961/time-since-no-developer-reponse-for-my-top-review-on-trove-with-various-complaints\n\n[h1]What was:[/h1]\nAn amazing sandbox/RPG style game that existed when I was in 8th grade(around 2 years ago). I would log in with one of my best friends and play, level, and build. Classes cost in game currency, so it only took around ~2 months for me of playing an hour a day to obtain every single class. Leveling was not difficult, mounts were not hard to get, and reaching max level was only a matter of time and not that far from people who spent money on this game. Market was somewhat balanced, item mall did not give too many OP items, and it was possible to see people reach max level without spending a single cent. Streamers were nice, loved the game(I was part of a streamer\'s guild and watched 20+ hours of his stream), and had massive giveaways that simply made every minute of this game fun to play. Grinding was not that annoying since drop rates were not unreasonable, and crafting materials were not so difficult to find or buy from others. When I would happen to get bored(very rarely), it would be a \'why not\' to just go ahead and play some soccer from a stadium one of the guild members created. Toxicity and scammers were uncommon, since many people were flourishing and being quite successful both economically and emotionally. I was mastery 60/100 at that time after only about ~150 hours(before steam release obviously).\n[h1]After Steam Release:[/h1]\nTrove created a ""Patron Pass"", basically a premium subscription based system that when activated, gave double drop rate, double exp, and multiple other benefits. This seemed miniscule at first, since not only was this given out two weeks for free, the buffs do not look that overpowered at first. However, at a deeper glance, trove seemed to slowly lower drop rates for rare items, and people would have to rely on Patron benefits to simply live like the old life of the f2p player BEFORE the steam release. However, this by itself was not bad, since trove gained more populrity, Trion struggeld to keep servers up. Level cap increased to 200. I only pushed myself for another 40-50 hours to make myself readch around level 90/200. Many systems were added to late game characters that seemed to break the economy, as late game players were the ones with 99% of the money. Imagine the game\'s economy going into a elitist form of economy, that\'s how it became. Materials became 20x more expensive(Going from 1 flux to 20) and some items were downright impossible to afford. I realized even though I spend more than 150 hours on this game before steam release, I was no poorer than a brand new player who spent 10 hours after steam realease.\n[h1]After the ""Cancer Patch"":[/h1]\nThis. This is the patch that ruined the game. Trion made it so classes could no longer be purchased with in game currency.  Trion claimed that this was to increase the variety among the classes and make people feel more individualized. However, nothing was actually done TO the classes to make them feel more different. In fact, besides a few unnoticable buffs/nerfs, classes remained virtually the same, so Trion failed to communicate that to the people. Although I had every single class(they released a class later that I obviously cannot get without giving them my cash), it seemed like a horrendously stupid move as more people started to actually play this game. \nThe classes problem was only the beginning. They added flying mounts later(Dragons). At first this sounds like an amazing idea, as these flying mounts were faster than wings. However, you\'d have to do daily quests every day for around a month to obtain one. That system was cancer, since logging in every day to do the same thing just to log out was monotonous and boring, Trion decided to scrap that system too. Since players were actually obtaining these mounts(How horrible right? /s), Trion decided to nerf this system and make a convoluted system where getting these dragons was near impossible and you would literally have to spend x3 the time getting these materials(since they divided the item into a 3 part item that needed to be crafted, hence x3 the time), getting these mounts was a fruitless endeavor.\nAs stated before, the economy was in ruin, so there was no way to be able to recover without buying items to sell in the item mall, or buying mounts directly that increased your level. I gave up at level 100/300, dirt broke even after grinding in the beta and doing 50 hours of grinding after steam release. Streamers have quit, even the streamer\'s guild I mentioned before had dissipated(LegendaryStudios). All my friends quit and think of this only as a \'meme game\'. After Trion added more and more to the item mall that made this game completely pay2win, this game became a generic f2p that lost all originality that this game once was.  This game had a lot of history with me, and now that simply is just a memory.\n\nBeta:\n9/10\nSteam Release:\n5/10\n""Cancer"" Patch:\n1/10\n\nEDIT1:I have recently read other reviews and I have noticed a common pattern. Devs seem to ignore and lock threads that have expressed concerns for the huge amount of bugs(since I did not mention these in my original review), huge gameplay downsides, and obvious player distaste for the cancer patch. When the players showed their absolute animosity towards changing a major system in the game(such as the classes costing real money), Trion did NOTHING to calm down the players or change this horrible system.\n\nEDIT2:I never knew this review would actually gain a lot of support from the steam community, so thanks for the support. However, I will say be wary of this review and if it gets taken down, you know what happened.', 'My advice.... Save your time and money.\n\nI can\'t emphasize this enough, yes its ""free to play"" but you WILL end up paying something, if not a lot of your hard earned cash. 90% of the same old bugs from beta are still there, events are recycled to the point everyone just AFK farms them and the actual content updates come around once a year. All that is left is grinding. \n\nOnce you get to U9, where the majority of the people are, you will be plagued by rubber banding, slow chunk loading and constant disconnects. The devs really don\'t care, the fact they refuse to comment on it and delete or lock threads on the forum where people express their concerns, shows this. They just want new people to play, get hooked and shell out loads of cash before they realize it.\n\nI wish I had been warned before I invested so much time/money into the game. (not through steam)\n\nTrove is a great game at its core, its just run by a greedy, money grabbing company with absolutely no respect for its players/customers.', ""Awesome game, with great content and even better community.\nHowever it's heavy on bugs/glitches and lacking support on forums. Servers & connectivity are horrible!"", ""I've seen a lot of negative reviews this past week and just wanted to write my review.  Currently 400+ hours into the game.  It is an amazing break from World of Warcraft as leveling up to about 15ish is very easy going.  Weekly rewards are nice to get, and the in-game community is pretty nice and helpful.  Dailies are nice too as after x amount of times opening Chaos Chest, you are guarenteed a mount/ally/something cool.  You get a lot of free stuff at first - like Mastery Rewards and cheap in-game deals (I would suggest buying the starter pack if you can spare $10).  I was expecting to find a lot of little kids playing this game, but I've actually found more young adults and some older adults too.  \n\nIf grinding and patience is not your thing, you will not enjoy this game.  The game does have some lag issues, and I've died a few times to it, but it's not all the time.   Building in this game is a bit different than Minecraft, and if you hate building there are plenty of other things to do.  It's definetly more enjoyable with friends or finding new in-game friends!"", ""I'm filled with nostalgia when I go back to my very first Trove club, to still see it remain standing strong. Even though it is virtually dead, atleast I can see where we first plotted our spawn point, the musical roads, a good quantity of mazes produced throughout the club's life time and numerous buildings that were once endevours. So many friends I stumbled upon during my activeness in the game. I love building with my Trove buddies more than that actual mining, leveling up, and slaining bosses. Happiness filled my soul because of this marvelous game."", ""[h1]Trove of adventures![/h1]\n[i]As i'm sure everyone would say after playing this game, where should I begin?[/i]\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nIf I had to say, I wouldn't say top notch. The graphics is okay, they can bug you. Minecraftish style but not as bad. There is alot more animation's, alot more detail. Do not take this the wrong way. The game hasn't done wrong, it feels right in a blocky sense of way.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nFantastic, that's what I say. The gameplay makes up for alot within the game. You can find alot to do. The recent ingame changes are also very nice. New level caps also I noticed. I know Trove gets some nice updates and some odd ones. Either way you cut the cake, you might still get cherries ontop. What I mean is, the updates normally consists of cons n pros, depending on wether you like cherries or not, some cons to others are pros. \nI honestly can't say how much gameplay there is while describing each one. It is just too much. You'll have to read more about it if you don't already know much. Basic gameplay is both creative and adventure. You will want friends or a club world to help out. You can own your own worlds, house, pets. You can wear any decoration, infact, the loot collector and item hunting is very uniqe making you as a player want to find every piece. Each piece you collect is saved & can be overlayered on set equipment. Base game rewards, item shop, minor NPC support. Alot to keep you going. It is mostly PvE, PvP is a thing too.\n\n[b]SoundFX:[/b]\nWhile being blocky in a block like world, you'd expect the characters of the world to sound different. They have nailed this. Music and sounds are pretty good. I'd have to say it wasn't expected but yes, the game sounds are good. The basic attack or hit sounds however is the same old sound, some soundFX are loopy.\n\n[b]PTW or FTP?:[/b]\nThis is one of the big concerns when entering a FTP game. Yes, it is FTP. 100%\nThe great thing about trove is how much they actually have to offer FTP. They don't charge you for club worlds or properties, they don't charge you for alot that they could or other games had or do now. The PTW options are minor but continues to support the servers. As any game, PTW has the options to speed up you're progress towards the game or simply for cosmetic styles. It is simply a choice. Do you enjoy the game? Do you feel it is under valued? Do you feel like the devs did decent work? Questions you ask yourself may lead to you spending a few bucks. But by all means, it is only optional, the choices we're in control to make. The game I'd have to say is FTP.\n\n[u][b]Personnal notes:[/b][/u]\nThis isn't survival, nor is it up to the standards of graphics these days. It is something I do enjoy playing so I must recommend it. Creativity lovers will really enjoy Trove as most already have. I do suggest playing Trove, espeacially if you don't mind low end graphics with high gameplay value. [u]Be warned,[/u] it is a MMO, it is a RPG. put these two together, you got yourself a cracked egg.

Market was somewhat balanced, item mall did not give too many OP items, and it was possible to see people reach max level without spending a single cent. Streamers were nice, loved the game(I was part of a streamer\'s guild and watched 20+ hours of his stream), and had massive giveaways that simply made every minute of this game fun to play. Grinding was not that annoying since drop rates were not unreasonable, and crafting materials were not so difficult to find or buy from others. When I would happen to get bored(very rarely), it would be a \'why not\' to just go ahead and play some soccer from a stadium one of the guild members created. Toxicity and scammers were uncommon, since many people were flourishing and being quite successful both economically and emotionally. I was mastery 60/100 at that time after only about ~150 hours(before steam release obviously).\n[h1]After Steam Release:[/h1]\nTrove created a ""Patron Pass"", basically a premium subscription based system that when activated, gave double drop rate, double exp, and multiple other benefits. This seemed miniscule at first, since not only was this given out two weeks for free, the buffs do not look that overpowered at first. However, at a deeper glance, trove seemed to slowly lower drop rates for rare items, and people would have to rely on Patron benefits to simply live like the old life of the f2p player BEFORE the steam release. However, this by itself was not bad, since trove gained more populrity, Trion struggeld to keep servers up. Level cap increased to 200. I only pushed myself for another 40-50 hours to make myself readch around level 90/200. Many systems were added to late game characters that seemed to break the economy, as late game players were the ones with 99% of the money. Imagine the game\'s economy going into a elitist form of economy, that\'s how it became. Materials became 20x more expensive(Going from 1 flux to 20) and some items were downright impossible to afford. I realized even though I spend more than 150 hours on this game before steam release, I was no poorer than a brand new player who spent 10 hours after steam realease.\n[h1]After the ""Cancer Patch"":[/h1]\nThis. This is the patch that ruined the game. Trion made it so classes could no longer be purchased with in game currency.  Trion claimed that this was to increase the variety among the classes and make people feel more individualized. However, nothing was actually done TO the classes to make them feel more different. In fact, besides a few unnoticable buffs/nerfs, classes remained virtually the same, so Trion failed to communicate that to the people. Although I had every single class(they released a class later that I obviously cannot get without giving them my cash), it seemed like a horrendously stupid move as more people started to actually play this game. \nThe classes problem was only the beginning. They added flying mounts later(Dragons). At first this sounds like an amazing idea, as these flying mounts were faster than wings. However, you\'d have to do daily quests every day for around a month to obtain one. That system was cancer, since logging in every day to do the same thing just to log out was monotonous and boring, Trion decided to scrap that system too. Since players were actually obtaining these mounts(How horrible right? /s), Trion decided to nerf this system and make a convoluted system where getting these dragons was near impossible and you would literally have to spend x3 the time getting these materials(since they divided the item into a 3 part item that needed to be crafted, hence x3 the time), getting these mounts was a fruitless endeavor.\nAs stated before, the economy was in ruin, so there was no way to be able to recover without buying items to sell in the item mall, or buying mounts directly that increased your level. I gave up at level 100/300, dirt broke even after grinding in the beta and doing 50 hours of grinding after steam release. Streamers have quit, even the streamer\'s guild I mentioned before had dissipated(LegendaryStudios). All my friends quit and think of this only as a \'meme game\'. After Trion added more and more to the item mall that made this game completely pay2win, this game became a generic f2p that lost all originality that this game once was.  This game had a lot of history with me, and now that simply is just a memory.\n\nBeta:\n9/10\nSteam Release:\n5/10\n""Cancer"" Patch:\n1/10\n\nEDIT1:I have recently read other reviews and I have noticed a common pattern. Devs seem to ignore and lock threads that have expressed concerns for the huge amount of bugs(since I did not mention these in my original review), huge gameplay downsides, and obvious player distaste for the cancer patch. When the players showed their absolute animosity towards changing a major system in the game(such as the classes costing real money), Trion did NOTHING to calm down the players or change this horrible system.\n\nEDIT2:I never knew this review would actually gain a lot of support from the steam community, so thanks for the support. However, I will say be wary of this review and if it gets taken down, you know what happened.', 'My advice.... Save your time and money.\n\nI can\'t emphasize this enough, yes its ""free to play"" but you WILL end up paying something, if not a lot of your hard earned cash. 90% of the same old bugs from beta are still there, events are recycled to the point everyone just AFK farms them and the actual content updates come around once a year. All that is left is grinding. \n\nOnce you get to U9, where the majority of the people are, you will be plagued by rubber banding, slow chunk loading and constant disconnects. The devs really don\'t care, the fact they refuse to comment on it and delete or lock threads on the forum where people express their concerns, shows this. They just want new people to play, get hooked and shell out loads of cash before they realize it.\n\nI wish I had been warned before I invested so much time/money into the game. (not through steam)\n\nTrove is a great game at its core, its just run by a greedy, money grabbing company with absolutely no respect for its players/customers.', ""Awesome game, with great content and even better community.\nHowever it's heavy on bugs/glitches and lacking support on forums. Servers & connectivity are horrible!"", ""I've seen a lot of negative reviews this past week and just wanted to write my review.  Currently 400+ hours into the game.  It is an amazing break from World of Warcraft as leveling up to about 15ish is very easy going.  Weekly rewards are nice to get, and the in-game community is pretty nice and helpful.  Dailies are nice too as after x amount of times opening Chaos Chest, you are guarenteed a mount/ally/something cool.  You get a lot of free stuff at first - like Mastery Rewards and cheap in-game deals (I would suggest buying the starter pack if you can spare $10).  I was expecting to find a lot of little kids playing this game, but I've actually found more young adults and some older adults too.  \n\nIf grinding and patience is not your thing, you will not enjoy this game.  The game does have some lag issues, and I've died a few times to it, but it's not all the time.   Building in this game is a bit different than Minecraft, and if you hate building there are plenty of other things to do.  It's definetly more enjoyable with friends or finding new in-game friends!"", ""I'm filled with nostalgia when I go back to my very first Trove club, to still see it remain standing strong. Even though it is virtually dead, atleast I can see where we first plotted our spawn point, the musical roads, a good quantity of mazes produced throughout the club's life time and numerous buildings that were once endevours. So many friends I stumbled upon during my activeness in the game. I love building with my Trove buddies more than that actual mining, leveling up, and slaining bosses. Happiness filled my soul because of this marvelous game."", ""[h1]Trove of adventures![/h1]\n[i]As i'm sure everyone would say after playing this game, where should I begin?[/i]\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nIf I had to say, I wouldn't say top notch. The graphics is okay, they can bug you. Minecraftish style but not as bad. There is alot more animation's, alot more detail. Do not take this the wrong way. The game hasn't done wrong, it feels right in a blocky sense of way.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nFantastic, that's what I say. The gameplay makes up for alot within the game. You can find alot to do. The recent ingame changes are also very nice. New level caps also I noticed. I know Trove gets some nice updates and some odd ones. Either way you cut the cake, you might still get cherries ontop. What I mean is, the updates normally consists of cons n pros, depending on wether you like cherries or not, some cons to others are pros. \nI honestly can't say how much gameplay there is while describing each one. It is just too much. You'll have to read more about it if you don't already know much. Basic gameplay is both creative and adventure. You will want friends or a club world to help out. You can own your own worlds, house, pets. You can wear any decoration, infact, the loot collector and item hunting is very uniqe making you as a player want to find every piece. Each piece you collect is saved & can be overlayered on set equipment. Base game rewards, item shop, minor NPC support. Alot to keep you going. It is mostly PvE, PvP is a thing too.\n\n[b]SoundFX:[/b]\nWhile being blocky in a block like world, you'd expect the characters of the world to sound different. They have nailed this. Music and sounds are pretty good. I'd have to say it wasn't expected but yes, the game sounds are good. The basic attack or hit sounds however is the same old sound, some soundFX are loopy.\n\n[b]PTW or FTP?:[/b]\nThis is one of the big concerns when entering a FTP game. Yes, it is FTP. 100%\nThe great thing about trove is how much they actually have to offer FTP. They don't charge you for club worlds or properties, they don't charge you for alot that they could or other games had or do now. The PTW options are minor but continues to support the servers. As any game, PTW has the options to speed up you're progress towards the game or simply for cosmetic styles. It is simply a choice. Do you enjoy the game? Do you feel it is under valued? Do you feel like the devs did decent work? Questions you ask yourself may lead to you spending a few bucks. But by all means, it is only optional, the choices we're in control to make. The game I'd have to say is FTP.\n\n[u][b]Personnal notes:[/b][/u]\nThis isn't survival, nor is it up to the standards of graphics these days. It is something I do enjoy playing so I must recommend it. Creativity lovers will really enjoy Trove as most already have. I do suggest playing Trove, espeacially if you don't mind low end graphics with high gameplay value. [u]Be warned,[/u] it is a MMO, it is a RPG. put these two together, you got yourself a cracked egg. The game can be very addictive as any MMORPG.\n\nGraphics:5.0\nSoundFX:6.0\nFunfactor:7.5\nOverall:6.5\n\n[i]Edited reasons:[/i]\nAdded ratings below\nFixed descriptions"", 'horrible it looks like a kids game but 13 yr olds cant play a disgrace', ""2k hours and i have to say everything on this game is good but there is some negative things for this game\n\n- super lag game \n- ultra pay to win game ( if you want to go higher mastery rank level you need to buy pack that give you mastery rank xp like 20$ to 50$ to get that pack  there is no free to play on this game if you are rich preson and you don't know where you put your money this game is right place for you.

I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen a game that is more pay2win than this one. You can literally buy yourself to being some of the most powerful players in the game, despite all those players that choose not to spend any money. Most people who say this game isn\'t pay2win are people who have spent hundreds of dollars themselves, choosing to deny their own waste of money. For anyone that still thinks this game isn\'t controllable with money, look at the ""shop"". You can buy all classes, infinite ""gem dust"", and anything else you need to become maxed out.

The Isle,Massively%20Multiplayer,376210,"['It\'s been years since I purchased this game, and I\'ve played for too long to be deemed healthy by health professionals. Seeing where this game started, and where it is now, I can only say:\n\nI am Disappointed. \n\nI joined when you could play exclusively in a progressive tree (Small dinosaurs for x amount of times leads to the next tier of dinosaurs) to produce an ecology of sorts. They added AI, more rivers and lakes and removed progression. This, with the idea of promoting a sort of self sustained ecology, backfired. Discords promote pay to grow (discord points through donating to help keep servers running for example), means there are servers that are 95%+ carnivores, and of those, are likely spinos/gigas/rexes. They can survive exclusively on the added AI (this was not possible when it first started), and if they die, they can come back as full grown top tier carnivores within minutes. There is no ecology. \n\nCombat went from hiding in bushes, to abusing broken hit-boxes, or crossing fingers that lag was working for you and not against you. Imagine playing Darksouls but your dagger has the range of a claymore at 2x size. \n\nToday? They have legacy (Beta) and Evrima (Beta Beta). Legacy is broken hitboxes and laggy, Evrima is testing a new combat system. Great. There is no effort to making a standing ecology however. both versions have rubber banding issues, and playing a single player is difficult and have GREATLY reduced odds if having to survive against clans/groups of friends. The removal of global chat in official servers have reduced the amount of -toxic- chat in game, but have successfully pushed people to using 3rd party programs with reduced capability of warning other players of misbehavior in servers. \n\nPromises. Promises. So many things promoted to publix that haven\'t seen light in years. ""Hypo"" Dinosaurs were seen briefly before being revoked from public access. Only devs could use them, and then devs stopped visiting server to show, no, -flaunt- this exclusive feature until the lack of existance. Humans being added? No. Cannibals being added? No. Vicious environments? No (Except for crippling fall damage from cliffs and drowning) Number of dinosaurs available for public use? Reduced. Number of customizable skins? Reduced (Earthy/muted Color palettes in Legacy have shown promise, but there is only 1 skin available and no color changing in Evirma currently)\n\nI feel in the years that have passed by, that the isle has shown very very poor improvement, and I don\'t expect this game to be better for -several years- at the rate and history that it has shown. \n\nThere was improvement for the first year. After that, it\'s been a heart break to watch this beast slowly decay and become ruined. The community is divided between people who hate the game and people who can only hope for the best. These two side will viciously attack the other in defense of their opinion. A quick youtube search or a visit to the isle reddit can give you any little bit of research to decide your fate on clicking \'Buy"".\n\nI post this review as a warning. It\'s fun for a little bit, but for a long term game, set your expectations low. I\'ll watch updates, but highly not recommend people playing due to slow development, lacking features, and toxic community.', 'The first thing to know about The Isle in 2021 is the two separate versions: Legacy and Evirma.\n\n Legacy is the ""default"" version of the game, and the version most people play. It has lots of dinosaur species and a very active playerbase, AI dinosaurs for carnivores to hunt down, massive well detailed maps dotted with human landmarks, rivers, lakes, mountains, jungles, grasslands and beaches, and two main gamemodes: survival and sandbox. In sandbox, every non-exclusive dinosaur in the game is playable. You start as an adult and basically do whatever you want. This can range from Death Matches to Dino Chatting Rooms. In survival, less species are available but the gameplay is more dynamic. You start as a baby dino, either a juvenile on your own or a hatchling with a mother. As you feed, hunt and survive, you grow in size and strength, becoming faster and more formidable until you become a fully grown adult. It is often necessary to form groups with members of your own species to better the chances of surviving. If you are a female dino, you can have your own young when you become adult (The nesting system allows other players to teleport to you as hatchling dinos, but they are completely dependent on you until they become juveniles.)\n\nSo that\'s what Legacy has to offer. But whats the catch?\n\nLegacy is the abandoned version of The Isle, no longer receiving updates from the devs. As such, it has lots of bugs, ranging from minor annoyances to game breaking glitches such as oversized hitboxes, rubberbanding, FPS drops, disconnections and more. There are also a few ""tricks"" that undermine the basic values of the game, such as tail riding. It can be more than infuriating when you lose your dino to something only describable as bad game design. Food spawns are also fickle. Certain regions of the maps lack AI for carnivores or bushes for herbivores. As such, many players tend to gather around hot spots rather than explore the maps. There are also toxic players who partake in frowned upon behavior such as ""carebearing"" or taking care of dinos that arent your own species, or ""KOSing"" or killing everything in sight for fun.\n\nNow what about Evirma?\n\nEvirma is an entirely new version of The Isle, a complete recode that was started after the Legacy code became too troublesome and frustrating for the dev team to work with. It has a lot of the features that Legacy had with more yet to come, in addition to many exciting new features including an entirely new map, new dinosaurs, reworks of old dinosaurs, new mechanics such as grazing for herbivores, grabbing dragging and swallowing kills for carnivores, new playstyles for unique creatures like pteranodon and deinosuchus, and new systems for food, perks and elder dinosaurs. Everything in Evirma is much more fluent and natural than Legacy, from movement to combat to the ecology of every distinct species. \n\nThe catch?\n\nEvirma is somewhat bare bones as of now, possessing a far smaller dino roster than Legacy. some features like the diet and elder systems have yet to be added, and as usual there are bugs. However, there have been regular patches and bug fixes from the devs, with a roadmap for future large scale updates already planned out.\n\nOverall, The Isle is a very unique take on the survival genre, and a delight for fans of dinosaurs and paleontology. Progress has been slow but steady, and the game already has a lot of promise with its dynamic gameplay. If you love survival games and dinosaurs, this ones for you. If you\'re more a fan of fast paced games, maybe pass on this one (Growth takes a while :D.)', 'After 1325 Hours of this game I think I can give a decent Review...\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEGACY IS DEAD - Not being updated at all and has hardly any player base at least for Australia.\n\nErivma is Alive - BUT is a toxic pool of Mixpacking Chinese hackers that will find you and hunt you down eventually due to ESP hacks. (They also love to sh!t talk in broken English while they kill you)\n\nIf you don\'t die to these people, you\'re most likely gonna die to people that just kill for sport, so in the long run its just a waste of time, no objective.. just mindlessly killing and eating.\n\nYes the official servers ""Have No Rules""  BUT that doesn\'t mean you should be hacking OR ruining the game for others by just making a MEGA PACK of 5 Stegos 5 Crocs and 8 Carnos to run and kill everyone on the Server..\n\nHonestly at the end of the day I do love this game and have met many good friends, maybe I\'ll reinstall it some day when they fix these issues, but atm its unplayable for me.', ""I've played that game for quite a while now and I have to admit it's not for everyone.\nit does have a lot of bugs but is still a loveable game.\nonce you know how to play and use specific dinosaurs it will bring a lot of fun.\nat the beginning it will be frustrating but when you find the right people to play with it's going to be a lot of fun^^\nmay I wish you a happy hunt^^"", 'dino born- dino eat- dino die', 'One of the hardest ""Not recommended""s I\'ve ever had to write up. On one hand, the game is unique, tense and fun. But on the other, it is a complete f**king headache to even bother playing or to work up the want to play it. \n\nIn the base game, whatever stupid name you wanna give it. You have to contend with rules, admins and children the likes of which not seen since modern GMod, let alone the whining, crying and other annoying vitriol one puts up with. On top of that, the devs cannot handle criticism and throw bitch fits if someone has a differing opinion than them.\n\nAs for EVRIMA or the ""It\'ll work this time guys"" version:\nImagine spending hours, LITERAL HOURS trying to grow up or find other people so you can chat to someone finally or go for a drink/do something that isn\'t just wandering aimlessly with nothing in sight but the occasional fish. Now, you finally find others, members of your own species no less, you should be glad right? Wrong, it doesn\'t matter if you\'re utahraptor, deinosuchus, even a fucking pteradon. You will be attacked and cannibalized by your own species. Why? Because players are assholes and they\'ve nothing better to do because EVRIMA is empty, and boring. \n\nTLDR: Great game but expect a lot of wasted time, headaches and dealing with shitters who kill you solely because they can and they were on the server for HOURS before you, meaning they had a day to waste getting big and ready to grief new spawns.', 'Haha funny dinosaur game go brrrrr', ""I do not recommend this game yet, it has so many bugs, almost as many as cyberpunk 2077, the development is super slow, and it's not worth your money right now, maybe in a year or so, cuz they update the game like every two months, and it's not even big updates."", ""If a game can be a scam this is it.  The devs are incompetent and never produce updates on time or even the things they promised in the multiple road maps. Instead of improving the game they constantly break it with 'bug fixes' every time something new is introduced. This is the only game I have ever seen actually go BACKWARDS in development and become WORSE than it was before. Save you and your friends money and just get Beasts of Bermuda or Path of Titans."", ""I have 10.8 hours in the game. This was right before envirma was a thing.

When envirma launched it took out EVERYthing they worked on and players came to enjoy. It was laggy, unplayable, crashed all the time. and even less things to do and less dinos to play.

Refund on The Isle requested.', 'It\'s been years since I purchased this game, and I\'ve played for too long to be deemed healthy by health professionals. Seeing where this game started, and where it is now, I can only say:\n\nI am Disappointed. \n\nI joined when you could play exclusively in a progressive tree (Small dinosaurs for x amount of times leads to the next tier of dinosaurs) to produce an ecology of sorts. They added AI, more rivers and lakes and removed progression. This, with the idea of promoting a sort of self sustained ecology, backfired. Discords promote pay to grow (discord points through donating to help keep servers running for example), means there are servers that are 95%+ carnivores, and of those, are likely spinos/gigas/rexes. They can survive exclusively on the added AI (this was not possible when it first started), and if they die, they can come back as full grown top tier carnivores within minutes. There is no ecology. \n\nCombat went from hiding in bushes, to abusing broken hit-boxes, or crossing fingers that lag was working for you and not against you. Imagine playing Darksouls but your dagger has the range of a claymore at 2x size. \n\nToday? They have legacy (Beta) and Evrima (Beta Beta). Legacy is broken hitboxes and laggy, Evrima is testing a new combat system. Great. There is no effort to making a standing ecology however. both versions have rubber banding issues, and playing a single player is difficult and have GREATLY reduced odds if having to survive against clans/groups of friends. The removal of global chat in official servers have reduced the amount of -toxic- chat in game, but have successfully pushed people to using 3rd party programs with reduced capability of warning other players of misbehavior in servers. \n\nPromises. Promises. So many things promoted to publix that haven\'t seen light in years. ""Hypo"" Dinosaurs were seen briefly before being revoked from public access. Only devs could use them, and then devs stopped visiting server to show, no, -flaunt- this exclusive feature until the lack of existance. Humans being added? No. Cannibals being added? No. Vicious environments? No (Except for crippling fall damage from cliffs and drowning) Number of dinosaurs available for public use? Reduced. Number of customizable skins? Reduced (Earthy/muted Color palettes in Legacy have shown promise, but there is only 1 skin available and no color changing in Evirma currently)\n\nI feel in the years that have passed by, that the isle has shown very very poor improvement, and I don\'t expect this game to be better for -several years- at the rate and history that it has shown. \n\nThere was improvement for the first year. After that, it\'s been a heart break to watch this beast slowly decay and become ruined. The community is divided between people who hate the game and people who can only hope for the best. These two side will viciously attack the other in defense of their opinion. A quick youtube search or a visit to the isle reddit can give you any little bit of research to decide your fate on clicking \'Buy"".\n\nI post this review as a warning. It\'s fun for a little bit, but for a long term game, set your expectations low. I\'ll watch updates, but highly not recommend people playing due to slow development, lacking features, and toxic community.', 'The first thing to know about The Isle in 2021 is the two separate versions: Legacy and Evirma.\n\n Legacy is the ""default"" version of the game, and the version most people play. It has lots of dinosaur species and a very active playerbase, AI dinosaurs for carnivores to hunt down, massive well detailed maps dotted with human landmarks, rivers, lakes, mountains, jungles, grasslands and beaches, and two main gamemodes: survival and sandbox. In sandbox, every non-exclusive dinosaur in the game is playable. You start as an adult and basically do whatever you want. This can range from Death Matches to Dino Chatting Rooms. In survival, less species are available but the gameplay is more dynamic. You start as a baby dino, either a juvenile on your own or a hatchling with a mother. As you feed, hunt and survive, you grow in size and strength, becoming faster and more formidable until you become a fully grown adult. It is often necessary to form groups with members of your own species to better the chances of surviving. If you are a female dino, you can have your own young when you become adult (The nesting system allows other players to teleport to you as hatchling dinos, but they are completely dependent on you until they become juveniles.)\n\nSo that\'s what Legacy has to offer. But whats the catch?\n\nLegacy is the abandoned version of The Isle, no longer receiving updates from the devs. As such, it has lots of bugs, ranging from minor annoyances to game breaking glitches such as oversized hitboxes, rubberbanding, FPS drops, disconnections and more. There are also a few ""tricks"" that undermine the basic values of the game, such as tail riding. It can be more than infuriating when you lose your dino to something only describable as bad game design. Food spawns are also fickle. Certain regions of the maps lack AI for carnivores or bushes for herbivores. As such, many players tend to gather around hot spots rather than explore the maps. There are also toxic players who partake in frowned upon behavior such as ""carebearing"" or taking care of dinos that arent your own species, or ""KOSing"" or killing everything in sight for fun.\n\nNow what about Evirma?\n\nEvirma is an entirely new version of The Isle, a complete recode that was started after the Legacy code became too troublesome and frustrating for the dev team to work with. It has a lot of the features that Legacy had with more yet to come, in addition to many exciting new features including an entirely new map, new dinosaurs, reworks of old dinosaurs, new mechanics such as grazing for herbivores, grabbing dragging and swallowing kills for carnivores, new playstyles for unique creatures like pteranodon and deinosuchus, and new systems for food, perks and elder dinosaurs. Everything in Evirma is much more fluent and natural than Legacy, from movement to combat to the ecology of every distinct species. \n\nThe catch?\n\nEvirma is somewhat bare bones as of now, possessing a far smaller dino roster than Legacy. some features like the diet and elder systems have yet to be added, and as usual there are bugs. However, there have been regular patches and bug fixes from the devs, with a roadmap for future large scale updates already planned out.\n\nOverall, The Isle is a very unique take on the survival genre, and a delight for fans of dinosaurs and paleontology. Progress has been slow but steady, and the game already has a lot of promise with its dynamic gameplay. If you love survival games and dinosaurs, this ones for you. If you\'re more a fan of fast paced games, maybe pass on this one (Growth takes a while :D.)', 'After 1325 Hours of this game I think I can give a decent Review...\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEGACY IS DEAD - Not being updated at all and has hardly any player base at least for Australia.\n\nErivma is Alive - BUT is a toxic pool of Mixpacking Chinese hackers that will find you and hunt you down eventually due to ESP hacks. (They also love to sh!t talk in broken English while they kill you)\n\nIf you don\'t die to these people, you\'re most likely gonna die to people that just kill for sport, so in the long run its just a waste of time, no objective.. just mindlessly killing and eating.\n\nYes the official servers ""Have No Rules""  BUT that doesn\'t mean you should be hacking OR ruining the game for others by just making a MEGA PACK of 5 Stegos 5 Crocs and 8 Carnos to run and kill everyone on the Server..\n\nHonestly at the end of the day I do love this game and have met many good friends, maybe I\'ll reinstall it some day when they fix these issues, but atm its unplayable for me.', ""I've played that game for quite a while now and I have to admit it's not for everyone.\nit does have a lot of bugs but is still a loveable game.\nonce you know how to play and use specific dinosaurs it will bring a lot of fun.\nat the beginning it will be frustrating but when you find the right people to play with it's going to be a lot of fun^^\nmay I wish you a happy hunt^^"", 'dino born- dino eat- dino die', 'One of the hardest ""Not recommended""s I\'ve ever had to write up.

You have to contend with rules, admins and children the likes of which not seen since modern GMod, let alone the whining, crying and other annoying vitriol one puts up with. On top of that, the devs cannot handle criticism and throw bitch fits if someone has a differing opinion than them.\n\nAs for EVRIMA or the ""It\'ll work this time guys"" version:\nImagine spending hours, LITERAL HOURS trying to grow up or find other people so you can chat to someone finally or go for a drink/do something that isn\'t just wandering aimlessly with nothing in sight but the occasional fish. Now, you finally find others, members of your own species no less, you should be glad right? Wrong, it doesn\'t matter if you\'re utahraptor, deinosuchus, even a fucking pteradon. You will be attacked and cannibalized by your own species. Why? Because players are assholes and they\'ve nothing better to do because EVRIMA is empty, and boring. \n\nTLDR: Great game but expect a lot of wasted time, headaches and dealing with shitters who kill you solely because they can and they were on the server for HOURS before you, meaning they had a day to waste getting big and ready to grief new spawns.', 'Haha funny dinosaur game go brrrrr', ""I do not recommend this game yet, it has so many bugs, almost as many as cyberpunk 2077, the development is super slow, and it's not worth your money right now, maybe in a year or so, cuz they update the game like every two months, and it's not even big updates."", ""If a game can be a scam this is it.

But there is always going to be one thing that holds this game back and that's the fact that once in a blue moon you'll find someone playing something PvE wise online. I still actively play this and, be still my heart, get excited unlocking something for a character that people have had for a long time. This game used to be so exciting whenever the PvE scene was as active as the PvP scene and even in that category it's filled with cheesers who abuse namekian grabs and CC chain lock abilities making it unfun as well. Hoping that in this next expansion this game will see some light and hopefully as well get some community love. But until then, if you're a first time buyer, I would not recommend unless you have some friends to play with who will be just as active as you are due to the pricing. So if you're looking for help in grinding something or wanting to do things in PvE, feel free to add me and message me and I would gladly come and participate!"", ""TL;DR: The game is fun if you are a dragon ball fan, but I'd play it with friends if you can. Also, wait for sales if you care about the dlc, otherwise play it for what it's worth. \n\nI've played this game so much across so many platforms that I can tell you pretty much anything about this game.\nI will tell you outright that you will only enjoy this game if you are a fairly big fan of dragon ball. Even then, the game will absolutely test your patience at times. There are straight up BAD parts of this game. That being said, because I am a gigantic dragon ball fan I absolutely love it. \n\nIf you're looking to scratch that itch of playing a dragon ball game that feels similar to games from the budokai tenkaichi or raging blast series' then this is the game. It's not really all that complex to play, but you feel like you're a dragon ball character (which is especially cool since you get to make your own character as well). It's not really a *fighting* game, so don't expect FighterZ level complexity (also a dope game). \n\nThe main draw this game has on me (besides being a dragon ball game) is honestly being able to play with friends. It has plenty of PVE stuff for you to do in the form of the hundred or so parallel quests (which can also be added to with dlc). It's got that large character roster that you'd expect from the aforementioned games (though the characters also aren't all 100% unique).\n\nThe biggest negative from this game is more so the business side instead of the game side. The game is expensive as fuck. It's 5 years old still basically full priced, and it contains so many dlc packs that enhance the life of the game. If you want EVERYTHING the game can offer, the dlc is *kind of* necessary. I say it's kind of necessary because at a point you just become so damn strong that most of the missions become chump change, and the dlc quests that are added are notoriously hard as dicks. You can pass on the dlc if you don't really care about any of the characters they add/want new missions. If you want the COMPLETE game, I highly suggest waiting until the game is under $10 with special pricing on the dlc. I bought the game as gift for a friend recently and with EVERYTHING it was about the same price as the base game normally is. \n\nThe other really annoying business side of the game is that it does have some F2P game mechanics. There is an in-game currency that allows to get clothes, skills, etc. You don't have to pay any of it, but I find it frustrating that they have these predatory business practices in a game that you could very well be paying over $100 for (base game and all the dlc packs.)\n\nOverall, it's a game I find myself getting sucked back into time and time again. \n\nPlus, you can dress up as Mr. Satan while being a SSJB shooting a big bang attack, and I think there's something beautiful about that. \n\n\n\n"", '\n\n3/5 without mods\n\n5/5 WITH mods', 'Good game especially for DB fans, A must buy when game and DLC goes on sale.', 'Very great game for making a Majin waifuu.\n', 'Great Game!', ""Okay so before i say anything i just want to say this is a great game if you enjoy fighting games and are a big fan of the dragon ball franchise. its got plenty of content ranging from online to offline, but i ran into one issue that and that is with the controls for controller. if you're a player who has played on console and just getting it on pc. its a hassle binding all the controls from ps4 or xbox. it would save some time implementing a preset already made from the console controls just so its easier."", 'the game is Really bad', 'cool game go pew pew', 'lots of story and one of the few fighting games meant to be played with a keyboard', 'For the time being, Online multiplayer is broken and does not work. sounds like it broke just before I purchased it and has been broken at least a month.

But there is always going to be one thing that holds this game back and that's the fact that once in a blue moon you'll find someone playing something PvE wise online. I still actively play this and, be still my heart, get excited unlocking something for a character that people have had for a long time. This game used to be so exciting whenever the PvE scene was as active as the PvP scene and even in that category it's filled with cheesers who abuse namekian grabs and CC chain lock abilities making it unfun as well. Hoping that in this next expansion this game will see some light and hopefully as well get some community love. But until then, if you're a first time buyer, I would not recommend unless you have some friends to play with who will be just as active as you are due to the pricing. So if you're looking for help in grinding something or wanting to do things in PvE, feel free to add me and message me and I would gladly come and participate!"", ""TL;DR: The game is fun if you are a dragon ball fan, but I'd play it with friends if you can. Also, wait for sales if you care about the dlc, otherwise play it for what it's worth. \n\nI've played this game so much across so many platforms that I can tell you pretty much anything about this game.\nI will tell you outright that you will only enjoy this game if you are a fairly big fan of dragon ball. Even then, the game will absolutely test your patience at times. There are straight up BAD parts of this game. That being said, because I am a gigantic dragon ball fan I absolutely love it. \n\nIf you're looking to scratch that itch of playing a dragon ball game that feels similar to games from the budokai tenkaichi or raging blast series' then this is the game. It's not really all that complex to play, but you feel like you're a dragon ball character (which is especially cool since you get to make your own character as well). It's not really a *fighting* game, so don't expect FighterZ level complexity (also a dope game). \n\nThe main draw this game has on me (besides being a dragon ball game) is honestly being able to play with friends. It has plenty of PVE stuff for you to do in the form of the hundred or so parallel quests (which can also be added to with dlc). It's got that large character roster that you'd expect from the aforementioned games (though the characters also aren't all 100% unique).\n\nThe biggest negative from this game is more so the business side instead of the game side. The game is expensive as fuck. It's 5 years old still basically full priced, and it contains so many dlc packs that enhance the life of the game. If you want EVERYTHING the game can offer, the dlc is *kind of* necessary. I say it's kind of necessary because at a point you just become so damn strong that most of the missions become chump change, and the dlc quests that are added are notoriously hard as dicks. You can pass on the dlc if you don't really care about any of the characters they add/want new missions. If you want the COMPLETE game, I highly suggest waiting until the game is under $10 with special pricing on the dlc. I bought the game as gift for a friend recently and with EVERYTHING it was about the same price as the base game normally is. \n\nThe other really annoying business side of the game is that it does have some F2P game mechanics. There is an in-game currency that allows to get clothes, skills, etc. You don't have to pay any of it, but I find it frustrating that they have these predatory business practices in a game that you could very well be paying over $100 for (base game and all the dlc packs.)\n\nOverall, it's a game I find myself getting sucked back into time and time again. \n\nPlus, you can dress up as Mr. Satan while being a SSJB shooting a big bang attack, and I think there's something beautiful about that. \n\n\n\n"", '\n\n3/5 without mods\n\n5/5 WITH mods', 'Good game especially for DB fans, A must buy when game and DLC goes on sale.', 'Very great game for making a Majin waifuu.\n', 'Great Game!', ""Okay so before i say anything i just want to say this is a great game if you enjoy fighting games and are a big fan of the dragon ball franchise. its got plenty of content ranging from online to offline, but i ran into one issue that and that is with the controls for controller. if you're a player who has played on console and just getting it on pc. its a hassle binding all the controls from ps4 or xbox. it would save some time implementing a preset already made from the console controls just so its easier."", 'the game is Really bad', 'cool game go pew pew', 'lots of story and one of the few fighting games meant to be played with a keyboard', 'For the time being, Online multiplayer is broken and does not work. sounds like it broke just before I purchased it and has been broken at least a month.

It's going to be familiar to anyone that has played Everquest, DAoC, WoW, etc. While it means you're not getting any particularly amazing new mechanics, the perk is that LOTRO has figured out how to get the best out of those systems.

Bree, as well as the various Inns and Halls located therein, have some fantastic scores attached to them.\n\nLet's be honest though - if you play LOTRO you're probably here because it's Lord of the Rings. And in that regard, you will not be disappointed. The game is steeped in the lore - books and films - and has little nods to it scattered everywhere that are rewarding for someone that is really into their Tolkien scholarship.

Overall, highly recommended.', 'This is probably one of my favorite things to review...as you can tell by my hours..198.8 hours total, BUT I have 64.9 Hours just in two weeks, thats how addicting this game can be, that is with no sitting around, no afking or etc..it\'s a very fun game..But with the fanboying aside lets get to what you guys came for and give my Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\nGreat Community (very helpful no matter what server your on)\nBeautiful Atmosphere\nNever breaks the tolkien universe feeling (which means always feels like your really in the Tolkien Universe) \nGreat Variety in Weapons, skill sets, and armors, you will rarely find someone with the same kind of armor and or weapon as you or even close for that matter\nVery Unique in its own way, personally I love the cosmetic system, it adds this feeling to kind of drive you into the universe more so you can kinda be more in character, feel like your there (Cosmetic system, allows you to equip armor and weapons that you would personally think suits you, so for man it would be ranger armor and etc, dwarves heavy dwarven armor and etc...Personally it a great feature as it gives a better feeling to it) \nTeams still working on the game, making it much better with every update!\nAdded a new race called Beorning with the class (their like druids, for WoW players you turn into a bear pretty much lol) But also hard to get on free to play..but possible!\nHas own servers for Roleplayers (so if your into kind of the Tolkien universe for LOTR that you know a lot about roleplaying and stuff give it a shot, people are very forgiving on Laurelin (the EU and US RP server) along with other servers as well.\nHas some wonderfu crafting mechanics that could very much benefit you if you are in a Kinship (kind of like a clan) you can help each other have the gear you need to FIGHT For middle earth!\n\nCons:\nSadly, helps the VIP a lot, with all expansions and etc unlocked\nF2P\'s have to ""farm"" all their points in order to level\nF2P\'s have a huge grind\nSometimes you could be looked down upon from being a f2p by VIP\'s (more my personal experience but still, something to be careful about)\nTime Consuming farming (not too much of a complaint as that\'s how its suppose to be XD)\nGraphics for character are out of date (expected of course from 2009)\nSome areas can be depressing yes, but that DOESN\'T mean its still not beautiful, you could be taken away by the beautiful areas around Angmar, or the huge mountains in Moria or just in the Misty Mountains great places to go (harder to get to if your F2P, trust me..I farmed the points, tough but worth it) \n\nThese are of course my personal Pros and Cons, as you would expect, but most of them were based off of other people\'s reactions to the game and stuff like that, so it is not just me spewing a bunch of stuff out for someone to read :P I hoped you loved the review, and trust me I\'d gladly give it a 10/10 course it has its flaws but it is still beautiful, fun, and interesting.\n\nAnd always remember....Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! (which means...Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!) Sorry i\'m a dwarf Junkie myself! :P I love dwarves and their history in the Tolkien universe.', 'to steam dev.\nthe downloadable content from steam is too outdated, please update your  game, so steam dont refuse our updated version and delete it then try to re-download the outdated content from your servers', '10 years and still fascinating millions of people world wide. Lotro is right behind WoW and Everquest in long time popularity. For good reasons. The community loves Tolkiens world and they treat eachother with respect and open arms. The most important game in my long history of gaming - an MMO legend you should not miss if you are interested in Middle Earth and its tales. What Peter JAckson did for the books in the movie world, Turbine the developer did for the gaming world. A beautiful and surprisingly accurate depiction of the books and scriptures of JRR Tolkien. A timeless Art Direction makes the game still look relevant today. \nJoin the greatest Fantasy Universe ever imagined.', ""Lotro's graphics maybe somewhat dated at the moment and mechanically it does not stand out to much from other mmos using the same model, but the game does justice to the breadth and scope of Middle Earth and Tolkien's deep lore. I recommend this game to people who value small ambient touches in a game over wow factor and of course to any readers of the Professor."", ""Great MMO that's actually totally F2P if you don't mind farming special currency."", ""If you're a Tolkien fan, you should love this. It's a lot of fun seeing how much care and attention has gone into recreating the world of middle earth. \nAs an MMO, it is one of the best ones out. It is certainly more geared to solo players, but does a good job of catering to everyone. The classes range from basic to some of the most advanced and interesting classes I've ever seen in an MMO. (Take Warden or LoreMaster for example)! The community is also one of the friendliest and the servers are still busy and alive to this day. It has stood the test of time and still looks astonishingly beautiful as ever. Add to all that it has fantastic mood setting music you've got a class A product. Many players simply can't stop at a single character and over the years I have kept on coming back to this game. Without a doubt my favourite MMO ever. It's also great to see the dedication of Standing Stone in keeping their work alive and keeping lotro safe for the future years with a decent, not overly greedy free to play system. Much of the content can be enjoyed for free and extras can be bought as required. The only time you may consider spending money is to open up quest packs in different regions and expansion packs. But considering the size and amount of time you could foreseeably spend in this masterpiece, it is well worth it!"", 'My playtime should say enough.\n', 'I present you the video passage of the game Lord of the Rings Online, more precisely, its main storyline, which is here proudly called ""epic"". Numerous side quests scattered throughout Middle-earth will not enter this passage, since for the most part they are tasks like ""kill 5 goblins"" or ""bring 10 wolf tails"" and, with rare exceptions, are not worthy of our attention. But the main storyline is very interesting and, most importantly, it very closely intersects with the plot of the books ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit."" We will meet a lot of familiar characters, take part in familiar events and how to properly ponostalgiruem.\n\nI will make a reservation that this video passage was created in order to consider the plot of the game and compare it with the books ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"", and not run through the whole game, skipping past the description of the quests and doing endless shooting of monsters. Passage does not carry the main purpose of suggesting something to the players (although not without this, of course). Here, rather nostalgia, combined with the analysis of the plot and its connection with the original, untouched universe.', ""Fun game, although you feel kinda left out if you don't pay money into the game. It's not impossible to progress without money, but the game askes for it a lot. \n\nIt's kinda a fun game without money, but recommened playing with friends or else it gets boring fast.\n\nIt has skill trees which is always fun in games. Archer is OP in 1v1's late game, I reccomened though!"", ""Best mmo and best gaming community I have ever encountered, how old the game is doesn't make it look bad at all, it makes it feel kind of special. Only bad thing is that the game has a bad tutorial. It is free to play but there is dlc.  U can buy them with a very rare in-game currency that takes a long time to get but most people buy most of them. PvP is Like no other game and amazing. U can play as orcs and spiders or the free people of middle earth, there is a big PvP region where there are out posts to capture that give buffs, castles that if defeated join your faction and give you quests, and an entire secret underground world filled with bosses, not to mention towns and mines to do quests and farm so u never even have to fight another player if you don't want to. You are going to want to work in groups of at least two though to survive, especially if u are low rank because there are high levels from the other faction roaming and npcs meant to fight groups of people."", 'good game needs to sort out pvp it sucks in nearly 10 years they put a tree in game and added some mushrooms , come on\nsort it\n', 'Old school game :)..', 'Lets go to Mordor baby!!!!', ""This game has taken months off of my life and I still love it.

However, due to lack of focus the game becomes a conflicted mess once you think about it.\n\n[h2]Pros:[/h2]\n[List]\n[*][b]Excellent controls - [/b]Simple and effective, they are not too tight and not too loose. Steering is challenging at high speeds but not impossible.\n[*][b]Sense of speed - [/b]I cannot remember any other game with such a great sense of speed. You accelerate quickly and moving fast is exhilarating. And when you are able to thread the needle it is so satisfying.\n[*][b]Procedural generation - [/b]Basically an infinite amount of tracks. There is also a lot of variety because of it and the fact that there are 8 distinct biomes with different hazards and features.\n[/List]\n\n[h2]Cons:[/h2]\n[List]\n[*][b]It does not know what it wants from you - [/b]You start playing and naturally you follow the track downhill. Going as fast as possible towards the finish line is very fun. But soon you realize that you can go off track and ignore the preset track, and then you realize that there is no good incentive to go fast and that the best way to reach the goal reliably is to crawl down at a snail's pace. All that matters is that you do not crash, nothing else is important. I made it to the end just by slowly rolling downhill and pressing the breaks constantly. I think the idea is that there are many intended ways of playing e.g. going fast, doing stunts, drifting or going off-road. And by making all of those options viable that failed to make it worthwhile adhering to either style.\n[*][b]Roughlike structure - [/b]Each run you make it through one or more maps of connected nodes that represent a track. They have different stats and modifiers but since going slow is the way to go, nothing matters. What playing risky can give you are extra lives and crewmembers. I might suck, but going for extra lives is often more risky than just ignoring the challenge and descent safely. Losing a life trying to gain one is a zero sum game at best. Crewmembers give extremely niche or minor bonuses that do not impact gameplay in any meaningful way. \n[*][b]Overworld map - [/b]There is no incentive to not just take the shortest path towards the map exit making the majority of each overworld map superfluous. Playing more maps are just more opportunities to mess up and lose lives. And apparently if you play too many maps the sun sets and you have to ride in the dark, but this NEVER happened to me and I never saw any reason to play more tracks than absolutely necessary.\n[/List]"", 'its like real life biking but I dont have to worry about crashing and breaking all my bones', 'Just look at my hours played the only game that keeps me coming back.

However, due to lack of focus the game becomes a conflicted mess once you think about it.\n\n[h2]Pros:[/h2]\n[List]\n[*][b]Excellent controls - [/b]Simple and effective, they are not too tight and not too loose. Steering is challenging at high speeds but not impossible.\n[*][b]Sense of speed - [/b]I cannot remember any other game with such a great sense of speed. You accelerate quickly and moving fast is exhilarating. And when you are able to thread the needle it is so satisfying.\n[*][b]Procedural generation - [/b]Basically an infinite amount of tracks. There is also a lot of variety because of it and the fact that there are 8 distinct biomes with different hazards and features.\n[/List]\n\n[h2]Cons:[/h2]\n[List]\n[*][b]It does not know what it wants from you - [/b]You start playing and naturally you follow the track downhill. Going as fast as possible towards the finish line is very fun. But soon you realize that you can go off track and ignore the preset track, and then you realize that there is no good incentive to go fast and that the best way to reach the goal reliably is to crawl down at a snail's pace. All that matters is that you do not crash, nothing else is important. I made it to the end just by slowly rolling downhill and pressing the breaks constantly. I think the idea is that there are many intended ways of playing e.g. going fast, doing stunts, drifting or going off-road. And by making all of those options viable that failed to make it worthwhile adhering to either style.\n[*][b]Roughlike structure - [/b]Each run you make it through one or more maps of connected nodes that represent a track. They have different stats and modifiers but since going slow is the way to go, nothing matters. What playing risky can give you are extra lives and crewmembers. I might suck, but going for extra lives is often more risky than just ignoring the challenge and descent safely. Losing a life trying to gain one is a zero sum game at best. Crewmembers give extremely niche or minor bonuses that do not impact gameplay in any meaningful way. \n[*][b]Overworld map - [/b]There is no incentive to not just take the shortest path towards the map exit making the majority of each overworld map superfluous. Playing more maps are just more opportunities to mess up and lose lives. And apparently if you play too many maps the sun sets and you have to ride in the dark, but this NEVER happened to me and I never saw any reason to play more tracks than absolutely necessary.\n[/List]""]"

Look on the internet, you will find dozens of people with hitches and fast-forward glitches, and you will find fixes that are nothing more than placebo. \n\n-No custom championships, really? REALLY? Assetto Corsa has Custom Championships and quite predates this game. I\'d forgive this if not for...\n\n-Static, unchanging career mode. In a game that prides itself on being the ultimate driver journey, and further prides itself on its weather system, which can pull real-time weather info from the real world... All of the weather in career mode is static, pre-programmed and scripted. Every race will always have the same weather, no matter what you do, this COMPLETELY removes replayability from the career, you are doing the exact same fixed races over and over again under the same conditions.\n\nI wanted to love this game, I LOVE racing games, but this..

I have a decent sim-rig used mainly for Assetto Corsa and RFactor, which I also use for American Truck Simulator. Those are all quite sensible 'simulations', and I wanted something a bit more fun.\n\nWell, Wreckfest is certainly fun! I imagine it's quite good using a gamepad using the top-down view, but with a force-feedback wheel, shifter, handbrake and pedals it's awesome.\n\nThe title doesn't really do it any favours, because there is more to this game than just huge crashes and wrecked cars. Yes, there are lots of demolition derby races, and even a last-car-standing mudpit. Watching the massive crashes on the replay is great fun. However, there are also lots of dirt track and circuit races too. The vehicle physics isn't going to worry Assetto Corsa any time, but it's still pretty realistic if you turn off all the driving aids. With a bit of handbrake you can set up some really impressive drifts, although the AI quickly proves that drifting is not the quickest way round the corners.\n\nThere's a bit of vehicle upgrading you can do, and to win some of the races you will need to upgrade the car. You can repaint your cars with a load of preset schemes, in an infinite range of colours.\n\nSetting up all the different input devices was a doddle, although it defaults to automatic gears, and finding the setting to switch to manual took longer than it should have! Once I'd done that, it took a couple of minutes to map my handbrake and Fanatec shifter. I also had to remap the wheel and pedals because it had assigned the wrong axes. Easy to do. Unlike RFactor, which seems to forget all my devices every time I play it. Grrrr.\n\nThe default Force Feedback setting of 80% was far too high for my wheel. It was fighting me and causing tank-slappers. I turned it down to about 60% and it's way better.\n\nSadly, the game doesn't support head-tracking, and the FOV setting is rudimentary if you are using a single-screen sim-rig. That's a shame, because driving in-car instead of top-down is really immersive, but in a game like this you need to know where the other cars are. Your car doesn't have mirrors either. There is a HUD, but I have to confess I don't use it much because the game is REALLY intensive! I guess I'll just have to buy a couple more monitors...\n\nThe music gets a bit repetitive, which is a shame because it's suitably high-energy hard-rock. It feels like it needs more tracks.\n\nOverall, a great fun game. Get it on sale, because there is quite a lot of DLC and you will want it all!"", 'it is sooo much fun especially when you have had a bad commute back home. So much fun', ""[quote]\n⚖️ Grade = A.

I have a decent sim-rig used mainly for Assetto Corsa and RFactor, which I also use for American Truck Simulator. Those are all quite sensible 'simulations', and I wanted something a bit more fun.\n\nWell, Wreckfest is certainly fun! I imagine it's quite good using a gamepad using the top-down view, but with a force-feedback wheel, shifter, handbrake and pedals it's awesome.\n\nThe title doesn't really do it any favours, because there is more to this game than just huge crashes and wrecked cars. Yes, there are lots of demolition derby races, and even a last-car-standing mudpit. Watching the massive crashes on the replay is great fun. However, there are also lots of dirt track and circuit races too. The vehicle physics isn't going to worry Assetto Corsa any time, but it's still pretty realistic if you turn off all the driving aids. With a bit of handbrake you can set up some really impressive drifts, although the AI quickly proves that drifting is not the quickest way round the corners.\n\nThere's a bit of vehicle upgrading you can do, and to win some of the races you will need to upgrade the car. You can repaint your cars with a load of preset schemes, in an infinite range of colours.\n\nSetting up all the different input devices was a doddle, although it defaults to automatic gears, and finding the setting to switch to manual took longer than it should have! Once I'd done that, it took a couple of minutes to map my handbrake and Fanatec shifter. I also had to remap the wheel and pedals because it had assigned the wrong axes. Easy to do. Unlike RFactor, which seems to forget all my devices every time I play it. Grrrr.\n\nThe default Force Feedback setting of 80% was far too high for my wheel. It was fighting me and causing tank-slappers. I turned it down to about 60% and it's way better.\n\nSadly, the game doesn't support head-tracking, and the FOV setting is rudimentary if you are using a single-screen sim-rig. That's a shame, because driving in-car instead of top-down is really immersive, but in a game like this you need to know where the other cars are. Your car doesn't have mirrors either. There is a HUD, but I have to confess I don't use it much because the game is REALLY intensive! I guess I'll just have to buy a couple more monitors...\n\nThe music gets a bit repetitive, which is a shame because it's suitably high-energy hard-rock. It feels like it needs more tracks.\n\nOverall, a great fun game. Get it on sale, because there is quite a lot of DLC and you will want it all!"", 'it is sooo much fun especially when you have had a bad commute back home. So much fun']"

I will compare this game to other RPG\'s or similar games. If you want a summary of this review I will write it at the bottom of this review along with the reviews of the DLC\'s but on to the start. \n\nINTRODUCTION: My Fallout Experience (the 1000 word essay) on how this game is great\n\nWe have all heard of ""Fallout New Vegas"" and I, as many others have been taught or shown across the internet is that this is the definitive best fallout game. So after some time I decided to get the game with all it\'s DLC\'s and decided that I would check out the game and see if all the hype was concrete or was just fallout fans with rose tinted glasses.\n\nI start of with installing and starting the game and realizing that it is completely uncompatable with windows 10. This may be on Bethesda\'s part as I know fallout 3 has this exact issue as well. So my journey begins in the mod manager and .ini files to enable more memory usage. But after these fixes the game only crashed twice throughout my whole 100 hour playthrough. \n(The mods included in my mod list have no effect on the game but only made it crash less and fix memory usage)\n\nSo I start of with an amazing introduction to the main factions and the story taking place in Fallout New Vegas from the get go by a aged but still good cinematic. Comparing it to the Fallout 4 cinematic I would say this one introduces alot more of the world to the player compared to the black and white war scene all about ""war never changes"". I start of the game with making my character. In comparison to other RPG\'s like Skyrim (or Fallout 4) this game truly gave you the tools to make your own character. Everything from the wacky dialogue options to actual things that could impact your gameplay is decided from what S.P.E.C.I.A.L points, skills and perks you picked. This really made it feel like your decisions mattered from the get go. So I get on my mary way out on to the Majave wasteland and instantly get hit with this massive world to explore but I follow a long the main story and talk to ""Easy Pete"" and get introduced to these amazing dialogue options. Comparing it to other Bethesda games they were truly fleshed out and you could totally make sense of the conversation when you could actually read a sentance that your character would say instead of a few words or ""yes"" and ""no"".\n\nAt this point I also get introduced to the Karma system where bad and good actions could impact your late game stats. As I get hit with these intrequet systems that I would say are pretty overwhelming if you don\'t expect it or are not used to RPG\'s or other roleplaying games I also discover the grave sight and see a grave. You can dig a grave but only if you have a shovel, so I go to the little ponsy shop in Goodsprings right next to the grave sight and buy a shovel. With this I had made an impact on my  gameplay through my choices and ended up with a laser rifle. A mid game weapon at level 2. When this happened I knew I was gonna have a good time with this game. I made my way and thought I would make my way to the big glowing tower that is the ""Lucky 38"" and boy did I get turned into shreds by those deathclaws. Facing the strongest enemy in the game and it not feeling like a cake walk like in a later released fallout game. It showed me where my place was which was killing powder gangers and thugs after I got my ass beat by every abomination I came across. It set a milestone for me to get through that valley and kill those radscorpions that plagued me when I left goodsprings. The game made me feel like I was in for a journey, a journey that was mine to make and my choices mattered. Here the characters, the voice acting, the effects. They were lasting and they did change the story for my character which made the game so much more enjoyable. \n\nAfter my introductions to the game as a whole I got to know the factions in the game a little more and if I were to summarize them I would describe them as such. The Legion are the ""bad guys"" who are misogynistic, dog fucking, twink boy-toy slave owners that base themselves on the ideals of the roman enthusiast Ceasar. Then we have the NCR (New Californian Republic) the ""good guys"" who traveled into New Vegas to help the citizens and by ""help"" they mean help the areas with recources they need.\n\nSUMMARY: \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe game held up to the expectations I was expecting which was shocking as I went into the game thinking ""this game is the best RPG I have ever played"". But it truly is the best RPG I have ever played and the best RPG on my game list. I love all the elements of this game and how your actions can impact the games surroundings and that your choices matter for the story and in general gameplay.\n\nCOMBAT:\nThe gun play is simple yes, yet satisfying and a lot of perks you learn compliment the experience. Melee is simple and don\'t involve more complex combat except block and swing but it is satisfying turning a ghoul\'s head into mash potatoe. \n\nSTORY:\nThe main story has a simple premise but has complex solutions as you can shape the ending of the game however you deem fit which is something truly rare in games these days. Even story telling games don\'t dwell into your choices mattering this much for the outcome of the story.\n\nSOUND/MUSIC:\nIf you don\'t turn on the radio in this game you are truly missing out on some bangers I am telling ya, but seriously the sound design in this game is as everything else truly masterful. You will have to explore the vaults and everything else with it\'s matching soundtrack that either puts shivers down your spine, makes you enticipate what combat scenario is next or makes you jam in out in the lobby halls of the casinos.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nNow this game is 10 years old so I didn\'t wanna slack on it too hard but even some games that came out the following year looked a lot better than this. But the graphics are not too bad, they are still good especially by 2010 standards and give more of a Fallout feeling to it all. Something about the graphical design of New Vegas just give more of a rustic run down wasteland sort of feeling with its orange tones but that might just be me.\n\nDLC\'S:\nI really enjoyed 3/4 DLC\'s which were. Old World Blues, Honest Hearts, Lonesome Road. If you are playing New Vegas these DLC\'s are a must play in my opinion as they are truly great DLC\'s. Dead Money on the other hand did not hit home for me as many others. But if you like dialogues with character building and clues of a mystery to solve and puzzles I can see how you would enjoy this DLC as well.\n\nARCHITECHTURE:\nThe buildings just look great, you know what they are supposed to be and in what conditions. You know what buildings stand out and which ones you can enter apart from some instances.\n\nTHE BAD:\nNow there are alot of great things with this game that is for sure, like how great the RPG elements are and so on. But there is a few bad things, like how the game isn\'t functional from the get go and that you have to manually fix it. There is also the landscape which has some unique parts like red rock canyon and the area around the strip that look notorious and when you are there you know exactly where you are. But a part from those specific places all the other 60~% look the same but that is the only concern I had when playing apart from some bugs and the two instances of crashes.\n\n\nRATING:\n\nGraphics:          ☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢         3/5\nRPG Elements: ☢☢☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢    5/5\nCombat:           ☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢         3/5\nGameplay:        ☢☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢     4/5\nStory:                ☢☢☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢  5/5\nSound Design:  ☢☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢     4/5\n(Added Content: ☢☢☢☢ / ☢☢☢☢☢   4/5)\n\nOverall Score: 4/5\nShould you buy it?

I will compare this game to other RPG\'s or similar games. If you want a summary of this review I will write it at the bottom of this review along with the reviews of the DLC\'s but on to the start. \n\nINTRODUCTION: My Fallout Experience (the 1000 word essay) on how this game is great\n\nWe have all heard of ""Fallout New Vegas"" and I, as many others have been taught or shown across the internet is that this is the definitive best fallout game. So after some time I decided to get the game with all it\'s DLC\'s and decided that I would check out the game and see if all the hype was concrete or was just fallout fans with rose tinted glasses.\n\nI start of with installing and starting the game and realizing that it is completely uncompatable with windows 10. This may be on Bethesda\'s part as I know fallout 3 has this exact issue as well. So my journey begins in the mod manager and .ini files to enable more memory usage. But after these fixes the game only crashed twice throughout my whole 100 hour playthrough. \n(The mods included in my mod list have no effect on the game but only made it crash less and fix memory usage)\n\nSo I start of with an amazing introduction to the main factions and the story taking place in Fallout New Vegas from the get go by a aged but still good cinematic. Comparing it to the Fallout 4 cinematic I would say this one introduces alot more of the world to the player compared to the black and white war scene all about ""war never changes"". I start of the game with making my character. In comparison to other RPG\'s like Skyrim (or Fallout 4) this game truly gave you the tools to make your own character. Everything from the wacky dialogue options to actual things that could impact your gameplay is decided from what S.P.E.C.I.A.L points, skills and perks you picked. This really made it feel like your decisions mattered from the get go. So I get on my mary way out on to the Majave wasteland and instantly get hit with this massive world to explore but I follow a long the main story and talk to ""Easy Pete"" and get introduced to these amazing dialogue options. Comparing it to other Bethesda games they were truly fleshed out and you could totally make sense of the conversation when you could actually read a sentance that your character would say instead of a few words or ""yes"" and ""no"".\n\nAt this point I also get introduced to the Karma system where bad and good actions could impact your late game stats. As I get hit with these intrequet systems that I would say are pretty overwhelming if you don\'t expect it or are not used to RPG\'s or other roleplaying games I also discover the grave sight and see a grave. You can dig a grave but only if you have a shovel, so I go to the little ponsy shop in Goodsprings right next to the grave sight and buy a shovel. With this I had made an impact on my  gameplay through my choices and ended up with a laser rifle. A mid game weapon at level 2. When this happened I knew I was gonna have a good time with this game. I made my way and thought I would make my way to the big glowing tower that is the ""Lucky 38"" and boy did I get turned into shreds by those deathclaws. Facing the strongest enemy in the game and it not feeling like a cake walk like in a later released fallout game. It showed me where my place was which was killing powder gangers and thugs after I got my ass beat by every abomination I came across. It set a milestone for me to get through that valley and kill those radscorpions that plagued me when I left goodsprings. The game made me feel like I was in for a journey, a journey that was mine to make and my choices mattered. Here the characters, the voice acting, the effects. They were lasting and they did change the story for my character which made the game so much more enjoyable. \n\nAfter my introductions to the game as a whole I got to know the factions in the game a little more and if I were to summarize them I would describe them as such. The Legion are the ""bad guys"" who are misogynistic, dog fucking, twink boy-toy slave owners that base themselves on the ideals of the roman enthusiast Ceasar. Then we have the NCR (New Californian Republic) the ""good guys"" who traveled into New Vegas to help the citizens and by ""help"" they mean help the areas with recources they need.\n\nSUMMARY: \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe game held up to the expectations I was expecting which was shocking as I went into the game thinking ""this game is the best RPG I have ever played"". But it truly is the best RPG I have ever played and the best RPG on my game list. I love all the elements of this game and how your actions can impact the games surroundings and that your choices matter for the story and in general gameplay.\n\nCOMBAT:\nThe gun play is simple yes, yet satisfying and a lot of perks you learn compliment the experience. Melee is simple and don\'t involve more complex combat except block and swing but it is satisfying turning a ghoul\'s head into mash potatoe. \n\nSTORY:\nThe main story has a simple premise but has complex solutions as you can shape the ending of the game however you deem fit which is something truly rare in games these days. Even story telling games don\'t dwell into your choices mattering this much for the outcome of the story.\n\nSOUND/MUSIC:\nIf you don\'t turn on the radio in this game you are truly missing out on some bangers I am telling ya, but seriously the sound design in this game is as everything else truly masterful. You will have to explore the vaults and everything else with it\'s matching soundtrack that either puts shivers down your spine, makes you enticipate what combat scenario is next or makes you jam in out in the lobby halls of the casinos.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nNow this game is 10 years old so I didn\'t wanna slack on it too hard but even some games that came out the following year looked a lot better than this. But the graphics are not too bad, they are still good especially by 2010 standards and give more of a Fallout feeling to it all. Something about the graphical design of New Vegas just give more of a rustic run down wasteland sort of feeling with its orange tones but that might just be me.\n\nDLC\'S:\nI really enjoyed 3/4 DLC\'s which were. Old World Blues, Honest Hearts, Lonesome Road. If you are playing New Vegas these DLC\'s are a must play in my opinion as they are truly great DLC\'s. Dead Money on the other hand did not hit home for me as many others. But if you like dialogues with character building and clues of a mystery to solve and puzzles I can see how you would enjoy this DLC as well.\n\nARCHITECHTURE:\nThe buildings just look great, you know what they are supposed to be and in what conditions.

I absolutely want to recommend this game as a big fan of dark souls series and for the gameplay quality but due to it's state I can not do so, I feel like I have the responsibility to inform you about the situation that's going on in the game. \n\nCheaters have taken over the game in large numbers, Dark souls has it's own brutal anti-cheat system but it is very ineffective when cheaters can create alt steam accounts to bypass bans and strike again. The cheating scene has been going on for years and years now but it has evolved to the point where cheaters can actually cause permanent damage to your PC or even pish information you'd not want to share online. These cheats are evolving constantly due to the big playerbase and lack of action from Bandai Namco. So who knows maybe in future Dark souls 3 on steam could work as a backdoor access to your PC in a way. Very high security risk here. I talked to Bandai Namco's support about the issue and they are aware of what is going on and I was told that they are working on the issue, but in truth nothing has been done in 3 years or so when all this started to boom.\n\nIf you play this game in OFFLINE mode you will not have any problems, also there are mods such as Blue-Sentinel which is telling you when you are being invaded by a cheater and it tries to block you connecting to them in future, use of this mod is bannable reason but Bandai Namco's anti-cheat can't track it as the mod does not affect the game itself that much.

It is called Lothric, where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge. In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words: ""The fire fades and the lords go without thrones."" When the link of fire is threatened, the bell tolls, unearthing the old Lords of Cinder from their graves...Aldrich, Saint of the Deep... Farron\'s Undead Legion, the Abyss Watchers... And the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital, Yhorm the Giant... Only, in truth... the Lords will abandon their thrones... And the Unkindled will rise. Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers.” [/i]\n\nI am a big Souls-Like fan thanks to Dark Souls III, the first game of the genre, and the series, that I have played. \nI have been planning on writing a review about this game for a long time now, but never found the perfect timing to do so. Now, that the game is having a discount, and probably there will be plenty of people coming to give it a look, I decided to write this review. \nLike I did with my Dark Souls: Remastered review on Steam, I will separate this review into 2 main parts: the Technical Aspect and the Story/Plot/Lore of the game. \n\n [h1] Technical Aspect: [/h1]\n\nFirstly, I would like to say that this game has not the same mechanics as Dark Souls I and Dark Souls II, they end up being faster-paced, and also a lot of hitboxes issues have been improved. With that said, due to the date of launch of the game, it’s is obviously getting better graphics and textures, 2 aspects that the previous games weren’t strong at. \nBeing FromSoftware the company that we are talking about, the scenario, the ambiance and the designs are, of course, on the point and perfectly fit in each occasion of the game, giving the player the same immersion given on the other Soulsborne games. Being even more detailed on that aspect, places like High Wall of Lothric, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, The Ringed City, Archdragon Peak, and Kiln of the First Flame, will mostly pass to the player a feeling of astonishment due to the amazing landscapes and atmosphere that they have. While, on the other hand, there will be areas that will give the player the feeling of progression and curiosity about what is to come, like, Road of Sacrifices, Cathedral of the Deep, Farron Keep, Catacombs of Carthus, and actually most of the other places to visit. \nJust like Dark Souls I, areas in Dark Souls III like Archdragon Peak and Untended Graves will be hidden and will only be discovered with certain triggers. \nThe music can be really amazing at some bosses, but at others, it can feel kind of boring, which is a negative trait when compared to Dark Souls I’s unique compositions by Motoi Sakuraba (that being only my opinion though). \nThe combat mechanic varied a lot from the previous games to Dark Souls III. Now there are specific habilities and possible combinations with each weapon presented. It synthesized ideas presented before in the other previous games and ended up making a pleasurable result (and, as said before, faster-paced). \nLastly, to conclude this topic, Dark Souls III is a game that will not feel somewhat tiring when compared to the other Dark Souls, it balances every aspect already mentioned and does an amazing job to entertain the player for the first run until how many times one will feel like to play it again and again and again (in my case, 4 runs have already been completed). \n\n [h1] Story/Plot/Lore: [/h1]\n\nIt would be impossible to put together every piece of lore in a review, thus I will be summarizing the main plot.\nUnkindled, the player is a composition of the ash from the once, fire-devoted, undead that has given itself to the flame, and its duty remains the same. \nThe game starts off presenting that the “fire fades” and that the Lords go without thrones. Giving that we are in the same universe set by Dark Souls I and II, we are left with speculations until finally arrive at conclusions by progressing in the game. \nThe whereabouts are the “same” as Dark Souls I… However, there are slightly different things that might give the idea of the passage of time. Hundreds, or perhaps, thousands of years have passed since the Age of Fire and mighty new Lords of Cinder have linked the fire to maintain it. Even though there are controversies on the “time” aspect in Dark Souls III. [spoiler] The time seems to be simultaneously blended with the Abyss and dark of long ago (in which the concept of time doesn\'t exists) and also the present that is experiencing the undying cycle of the fire legacy, which would probably be a base for proving the theory of the End of the World during the Filianore cutscene in The Ringed City (in which there is a burst of light, indicating time, and, consequently, a time-skip beyond the living of anything). [/spoiler]\nAs for the main objective, the player would have to kill the 4 lords of cinder that neglect themselves to link the flame once again because it would be useless and that they would die in which way. [spoiler] The only one that remains in the Firelink Shrine is Ludleth, whom has long ago linked the fire, and now is just waiting for his end on his throne... for that, he is known as The Exiled. [/spoiler] The objetive of killing those Lords would be to acquire the necessary power in order to link the fire.\nKilling every Lord of Cinder and putting their ashes on their thrones will let the player travel to the Kiln of the First Flame, [spoiler] the place where the battle against Soul of Cinder happens, a manifestation of every Lord Soul until then. [/spoiler]\nNot only in terms of new Lords of Cinder speculations and lore the game creates its identity, but there would also be the side-bosses encounters that reveal individuals or even groups that shaped the dying world of Dark Souls III (e.g. Pontiff Sulyvahn; Oceiros; etc). \nIn terms of DLC (Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City), lore-wise speaking, it presents a rich story completion and also the Grand Finale for the series with the final boss fight against [spoiler] Slave Knight Gael, an undead, like you, seeking the blood of the Dark Soul for his lady\'s painting, who would be going to paint a new world for humanity. [/spoiler]\n\n [h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nI cannot put in words my passion for the game, I can simply recommend buying it with or without a discount, it is worth each time played and each credit paid. I do not even possess a high knowledge about the game yet, but I am still discovering and reading about its deep and amazing world. \nGot some free time? Get Dark Souls\' series to play and you will not regret it.', 'fun to play with other players', 'Nothing you can write here will do it justice.  Its hard, play it. Just do it. Look up guides, play it through. Learn to love the process. You are going to die. Often just quit. Just play it through and thank me later. Your future gaming self will thank you. 10/10', ""This is, thematically and in terms of gameplay, the finest game in the Dark Souls trilogy. I recommend getting it on PS4 on XBox One, or getting it on PC and immediately installing an anti-cheat mod. Unmodded, the game has serious vulnerabilities. We're not talking floaters in Fall Guys - we're talking unpatched exploits that can potentially damage your hardware. Thus, and considering Bandai Namco's and From Software's poor track record with reacting to vulnerability reports, the product as is is extremely not recommended."", 'For anyone who doesn\'t want to read about my struggles with mental health and trauma, just read the TL;DR below. I get heavy in the full story about my experience with this game.\n\nTL;DR: Dark Souls III saved my life. I love it, and I think everyone should experience it, or any of the games from the Souls series. \n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n\n;\n\nI\'ve had many amazing and terrible experiences with this game, but overall, it\'s helped me cope with some of the most difficult years of my life. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, general anxiety disorder, and ADHD. I don\'t think I would have survived the depression and trauma I\'ve experienced lately if it weren\'t for this game. I failed out of a couple colleges due to mental breakdowns and attempted suicide on several occasions throughout the past 5 years. This game served as an escape from my everyday struggle. It\'s why I have 400 hours in this game on PC, and around 300 on PS4. I stopped playing this game a year ago, when I was finally in a good mental state of being.\n\nThen the pandemic came.\n\nI\'ve gradually lost the ground of mental stability due to isolation, separation from the person I love the most and my depression being exacerbated. Due to circumstances, I cannot see my partner in person nearly ever. The last time I saw them was in March, and February before that. Although that isn\'t the most difficult thing I\'ve dealt with this year. In January of 2021, my father had a massive aneurysm that he miraculously survived. Since then, though, he has been severely disabled and bedridden at a hospital. My family and I have been doing our best to keep him strong and on the road to recovery, but it\'s far from easy. At this point, he will be disabled for the rest of his life. The past couple months have been extremely trying, culminating with me calling the suicide hotline for the first time in years. I never thought I\'d get this low again, but life happens, y\'know?\n\nSince I called that hotline, I\'ve gotten a bit better. A lot of it has to do with my friends, family, and partner supporting me, as well as the therapy I\'m undergoing. I\'ve noticed though that I\'ve really improved once I re-downloaded this game and started playing it again. There\'s just... something about the immense challenge these soulsborne games present that is so special. Overcoming these challenges are so cathartic and inspiring, and helps me feel capable tackling my real life problems. This game has tortured me at times whenever I struggled to find victory. But I always came back to this game after every defeat, unable to let myself give up. It taught me that can\'t let myself give up on life, no matter how many times I\'m defeated.\n\nI had set a challenge for myself a couple years back: to defeat the Nameless King solo. I had never done this before, and felt I needed to prove to myself I could do it. I am far from a great Souls player, so this was a big deal for me. I spent a year trying to beat Nameless King by myself (I was on NG+7 too, as my best character was on that save). I spec\'d and re-spec\'d into various builds, until I got my character to be a lightning caster/dark melee build. It was past a year at this point for my attempts. One day, I was going at NK as usual. I managed to get him to half health in his second phase, but I had exhausted all my estus. I kept hacking at him though, little by little getting him lower. He hit me a few times, getting me to being one-hit away from death. At this point, I was close to beating him. Just a few more hits... when he got to being one-hit, I threw out an attack as he began his own attack-- a gamble. And then... \n\nI did it. I won. I beat him. I watched the cutscene in total shock. Not a word... I was speechless. I lit the bonfire and then broke down into tears of joy and relief. It is still the biggest accomplishment in gaming for me. Overall, I haven\'t experienced many accomplishments in my life. The feeling of a hard-fought victory, even in a video game, had inspired me to not give up, and still inspires me to keep on going to this day. This game is one of the many reasons why I\'m alive today.\n\nI feel like my story isn\'t particularly uncommon. Many people have comfort games or shows or movies or books, and it\'s fine still if you don\'t have one of those. Dark Souls III might not be a comfort game for everyone, but I know the Souls games as a whole have been THAT game for a lot of people still. It could be THAT game for you.\n\nIf you\'ve read this far into my story, thank you, I appreciate you so much. If you or someone close to you struggles with suicide, know that it\'s okay to feel that way. Life is hard and unforgiving at times. Painful, violent, and hopeless. And it will always be like that. But life can be also be immensely fulfilling. Full of love, joy, compassion, laughter, and peace. Hard times are often hard lessons so that we can grow stronger for ourselves and the people around us. The good times come to make life worth living, and the bad times come to make us worthy of life. If you\'re struggling, please, reach out to someone who cares about you, and if you can\'t find a person like that, the suicide hotline will be there for you (800-273-8255 if you\'re in the States). Suicide is a choice you make, but it isn\'t the only choice you can make. There\'s always a way out. You can conquer your demons. You are stronger than you know. Against seemingly immense odds, you can win. It\'s human to struggle. But it\'s also human to overcome. You got this. So all I have left to say is this:\n\n""Good bye then. Be safe, friend.

It is called Lothric, where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge. In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words: ""The fire fades and the lords go without thrones."" When the link of fire is threatened, the bell tolls, unearthing the old Lords of Cinder from their graves...Aldrich, Saint of the Deep... Farron\'s Undead Legion, the Abyss Watchers... And the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital, Yhorm the Giant... Only, in truth... the Lords will abandon their thrones... And the Unkindled will rise. Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers.” [/i]\n\nI am a big Souls-Like fan thanks to Dark Souls III, the first game of the genre, and the series, that I have played. \nI have been planning on writing a review about this game for a long time now, but never found the perfect timing to do so. Now, that the game is having a discount, and probably there will be plenty of people coming to give it a look, I decided to write this review. \nLike I did with my Dark Souls: Remastered review on Steam, I will separate this review into 2 main parts: the Technical Aspect and the Story/Plot/Lore of the game. \n\n [h1] Technical Aspect: [/h1]\n\nFirstly, I would like to say that this game has not the same mechanics as Dark Souls I and Dark Souls II, they end up being faster-paced, and also a lot of hitboxes issues have been improved. With that said, due to the date of launch of the game, it’s is obviously getting better graphics and textures, 2 aspects that the previous games weren’t strong at. \nBeing FromSoftware the company that we are talking about, the scenario, the ambiance and the designs are, of course, on the point and perfectly fit in each occasion of the game, giving the player the same immersion given on the other Soulsborne games. Being even more detailed on that aspect, places like High Wall of Lothric, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, The Ringed City, Archdragon Peak, and Kiln of the First Flame, will mostly pass to the player a feeling of astonishment due to the amazing landscapes and atmosphere that they have. While, on the other hand, there will be areas that will give the player the feeling of progression and curiosity about what is to come, like, Road of Sacrifices, Cathedral of the Deep, Farron Keep, Catacombs of Carthus, and actually most of the other places to visit. \nJust like Dark Souls I, areas in Dark Souls III like Archdragon Peak and Untended Graves will be hidden and will only be discovered with certain triggers. \nThe music can be really amazing at some bosses, but at others, it can feel kind of boring, which is a negative trait when compared to Dark Souls I’s unique compositions by Motoi Sakuraba (that being only my opinion though). \nThe combat mechanic varied a lot from the previous games to Dark Souls III. Now there are specific habilities and possible combinations with each weapon presented. It synthesized ideas presented before in the other previous games and ended up making a pleasurable result (and, as said before, faster-paced). \nLastly, to conclude this topic, Dark Souls III is a game that will not feel somewhat tiring when compared to the other Dark Souls, it balances every aspect already mentioned and does an amazing job to entertain the player for the first run until how many times one will feel like to play it again and again and again (in my case, 4 runs have already been completed). \n\n [h1] Story/Plot/Lore: [/h1]\n\nIt would be impossible to put together every piece of lore in a review, thus I will be summarizing the main plot.\nUnkindled, the player is a composition of the ash from the once, fire-devoted, undead that has given itself to the flame, and its duty remains the same. \nThe game starts off presenting that the “fire fades” and that the Lords go without thrones. Giving that we are in the same universe set by Dark Souls I and II, we are left with speculations until finally arrive at conclusions by progressing in the game. \nThe whereabouts are the “same” as Dark Souls I… However, there are slightly different things that might give the idea of the passage of time. Hundreds, or perhaps, thousands of years have passed since the Age of Fire and mighty new Lords of Cinder have linked the fire to maintain it. Even though there are controversies on the “time” aspect in Dark Souls III. [spoiler] The time seems to be simultaneously blended with the Abyss and dark of long ago (in which the concept of time doesn\'t exists) and also the present that is experiencing the undying cycle of the fire legacy, which would probably be a base for proving the theory of the End of the World during the Filianore cutscene in The Ringed City (in which there is a burst of light, indicating time, and, consequently, a time-skip beyond the living of anything). [/spoiler]\nAs for the main objective, the player would have to kill the 4 lords of cinder that neglect themselves to link the flame once again because it would be useless and that they would die in which way. [spoiler] The only one that remains in the Firelink Shrine is Ludleth, whom has long ago linked the fire, and now is just waiting for his end on his throne... for that, he is known as The Exiled. [/spoiler] The objetive of killing those Lords would be to acquire the necessary power in order to link the fire.\nKilling every Lord of Cinder and putting their ashes on their thrones will let the player travel to the Kiln of the First Flame, [spoiler] the place where the battle against Soul of Cinder happens, a manifestation of every Lord Soul until then. [/spoiler]\nNot only in terms of new Lords of Cinder speculations and lore the game creates its identity, but there would also be the side-bosses encounters that reveal individuals or even groups that shaped the dying world of Dark Souls III (e.g. Pontiff Sulyvahn; Oceiros; etc). \nIn terms of DLC (Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City), lore-wise speaking, it presents a rich story completion and also the Grand Finale for the series with the final boss fight against [spoiler] Slave Knight Gael, an undead, like you, seeking the blood of the Dark Soul for his lady\'s painting, who would be going to paint a new world for humanity. [/spoiler]\n\n [h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nI cannot put in words my passion for the game, I can simply recommend buying it with or without a discount, it is worth each time played and each credit paid. I do not even possess a high knowledge about the game yet, but I am still discovering and reading about its deep and amazing world. \nGot some free time?

Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,RPG,435150,"['One of the best RPG\'s I\'ve ever played. It most definitely has its flaws but the challenge you can get from this game is absolutely mint. \nSome things to note before buying this game \n\n1) It\'s armor system is unlike most other games. It blocks status effects and crowd control until it is removed then they can be applied (a couple of feats you can pick up can bypass this on enemies but that\'s the exception not the norm)\n\n2) If you\'re playing through this game for the first time, don\'t feel bad if you can\'t play it at the highest difficulty. It\'s not meant for a first time playthrough but to challenge experienced players on subsequent ones with more enemies, more intelligent enemy AI and (of course) stronger enemies as well.\n\n3) When building your party composition, it\'s better to do all 4 magical, all four physical, or two and two. I do not recommend you go with one person solely as one thing and the other three as another as that one person all by themselves will not be contributing much to fights.\n\n4) There is no ""tank"" in this game. That sort of role doesn\'t exist. There are also no traditional classes, optimizing for certain builds is of course a thing (and for harder difficulties almost mandatory) but the sky is the limit with your imagination so long as you play within the confines of the system\n\nHope you enjoy the game, feel free to hit me up if you\'re new and would like someone to play with. Game plays just fine solo as well but games are always more fun with others. =)', 'I started this game during COVID in August 2020, when a couple friends suggested that it’s like a tabletop RPG (“TTRPG”) and might be fun to play together weekly. I couldn’t get into it at first, mostly due to distraction, but once we got a good third of the way through the first act, I was intrigued. I then became more hooked each session and by the fifth or so, I was loving the game and actively looking forward to our game nights. Once we were halfway, I started a solo save to catch up to where we were, more thoroughly following the story on my own. It took us about 6 months to finish the game, but we never missed a week of playing in all that time and I completed my solo game soon after. While it was partially the social aspect of hanging out with friends online, it’s not an exaggeration to say that this game helped me stay sane during one of the craziest times of my life thus far and it will always hold a special place for me because of it. But that was also in large part because this game is simply awesome. It’s probably the only game that I ended up loving despite not enjoying the first solid 8 hours or so of gameplay.\n\nOS2 is essentially a TTRPG adapted to a fully realized digital world. While it has mechanics you might expect for a game going for that feel such as dialogue options, it does several other unique things to achieve that feel. For instance, one of the appeals of a TTRPG is that you can do whatever you want within the logic of the game, not just narratively, but with how you maneuver in combat. Considering the limitations of a finite game, OS2 allows for a multitude of combat options that never feels limited, even though obviously it is to some extent. The environment is highly interactable and can be used to your advantage with dynamic and creative environmental conditions. Skills like teleport and various battlefield-warping abilities also do much more clever things beyond just dealing damage. There’s also the system of physical and magic armor that prevents conditions, adding a layer of complexity that encourages strategic play, even though it’s deceptively simple on the surface. I still felt like I had the variety of options available in a TTRPG, even if it was limited to a finite combination of options. It says a lot when being stuck on a given fight could be solved by a better approach rather than simply trying to level up.\n\nOther TTRPG elements deal with the world-building, story, and tone. There’s a rich world with lots of peoples with their own rich histories and varied proclivities, interacting with internal and external factions and nations with their own agendas. I like that the different peoples and factions aren’t the usual monoliths common to fantasy and demonstrate internal diversity. There’s plenty of lore to be explored in Rivellon that makes the stories and locations you encounter come to life.\n\nThe tone achieved by the narrative is also on point. One commonality to a lot of TTRPGs is a serious story that inevitably has some silliness as the players get up to some mischief or another. This leads to dramatic and intriguing storylines that are willing to step back for a moment of humor that (ideally) doesn’t break you out of the story. This is exactly how I’d describe OS2. The story is fairly serious and involves some dark themes at times, but at numerous points, especially side quests, there are amusing NPCs and conversations galore that never quite break the narrative but add a good deal of clever humor and even some laugh-out-loud moments without straying into the just plain goofy territory that pulls you from the narrative.\n\nThis isn’t the prettiest game I’ve played for its time, but still looks great and I think it’s balanced very well with the playstyle, offering vivid, immersive, appealing scenery that isn’t too confusing to navigate. The audio design is amazing. Sound effects are fine, but the soundtrack is superb. I generally dislike the sort of generic DnD folksy tavern style music that this soundtrack mostly fits into. But for whatever reason, these songs just click with me and never blend together like much of that kind of music usually does to me. If I hear a song from this game, I’ll recognize it immediately. Some tracks are better than others, but overall, they all work quite well. The vast majority of the massive script is also competently voiced, which is incredible.\n\nI found the story pretty strong. There is a main quest full of twists and turns, personal to your character that you must progress to move on with the game. There are a number of side quests as well, a staple of RPGs that can be really hit or miss. While not quite as good as some of the best side quests like Witcher 3, I think the side quests are generally very good. OS2 dodges dull fetch quests and “please kill the rats in my cellar” quests. Even the simplest quests often are made more interesting in some way, such as an early quest in which you have to fight a trio of saltwater crocodiles who have swallowed a pair of teleportation gloves that will be super useful once you get them. The quests are almost always engaging in some way given the strong writing of NPCs and the worldbuilding features that makes these quests entertaining in their own right even aside from the consequent exploration and challenge. None of the quests did I feel like was just some random bullshit I was doing solely to get experience.\n\nThere are 6 pre-made characters to choose from. I’ll call these “canon PCs.” Each canon PC has a continuing personal quest such as Lohse’s quest to rid herself of demonic possession or Sebille’s quest for revenge. These quests are a great way to flesh out the main characters, even if they’re not super long and only come up intermittently. Through several playthroughs, I played through the story quests of every canon PC. While my favorites are Lohse, Fane, and Sebille, none of the personal stories fell flat and I can’t imagine playing through the game with one of them in your party without doing their personal quests. Beware, if you make a custom character, you don’t get a personal story.\n\nThe gameplay is great. This is almost definitely my favorite combat system for a pure turn-based RPG. The combat is in a lot of ways closer to “turn-based strategy” than purely “RPG,” but this fits the TTRPG style with line of sight, distance, range, positioning, area of effect, enemy weaknesses, and build diversity all being important to your success in a given battle. There’s a wealth of options for each of your four party members to invest in and combine. Even after three playthroughs, there are still styles and skill combinations I’m interested in trying out some time.\n\nThis game can be played in a group or solo. In a solo game, you get one main character and fill your party with up to three of the other canon PCs. As a group, each of you has plays their own main character, filling any other slots with side characters. It was really fun experiencing, commentating, and poking fun at the story’s events as a group of three. I enjoyed my group game a bit more on balance, but that will depend on your group. If you have a hard time following the story when communicating with your group, it may not be as enjoyable but we mostly were able to follow it despite talking the whole time on voice chat. The gameplay is solid, but you’re really missing out if you can’t pay attention to the narrative this game has to offer so I’d prioritize that. I found solo play easier as it gives you more control over party synergy and coordination and I was better able to engage with the story and learn the basics of gameplay and strategy. The other major difference is in a group, you have to make sure to listen in on conversations with NPCs or you simply miss story, so you have to coordinate.\n\nUltimately, this game rocks.

It blocks status effects and crowd control until it is removed then they can be applied (a couple of feats you can pick up can bypass this on enemies but that\'s the exception not the norm)\n\n2) If you\'re playing through this game for the first time, don\'t feel bad if you can\'t play it at the highest difficulty. It\'s not meant for a first time playthrough but to challenge experienced players on subsequent ones with more enemies, more intelligent enemy AI and (of course) stronger enemies as well.\n\n3) When building your party composition, it\'s better to do all 4 magical, all four physical, or two and two. I do not recommend you go with one person solely as one thing and the other three as another as that one person all by themselves will not be contributing much to fights.\n\n4) There is no ""tank"" in this game. That sort of role doesn\'t exist.

Game plays just fine solo as well but games are always more fun with others. =)', 'I started this game during COVID in August 2020, when a couple friends suggested that it’s like a tabletop RPG (“TTRPG”) and might be fun to play together weekly. I couldn’t get into it at first, mostly due to distraction, but once we got a good third of the way through the first act, I was intrigued. I then became more hooked each session and by the fifth or so, I was loving the game and actively looking forward to our game nights. Once we were halfway, I started a solo save to catch up to where we were, more thoroughly following the story on my own. It took us about 6 months to finish the game, but we never missed a week of playing in all that time and I completed my solo game soon after. While it was partially the social aspect of hanging out with friends online, it’s not an exaggeration to say that this game helped me stay sane during one of the craziest times of my life thus far and it will always hold a special place for me because of it. But that was also in large part because this game is simply awesome. It’s probably the only game that I ended up loving despite not enjoying the first solid 8 hours or so of gameplay.\n\nOS2 is essentially a TTRPG adapted to a fully realized digital world. While it has mechanics you might expect for a game going for that feel such as dialogue options, it does several other unique things to achieve that feel. For instance, one of the appeals of a TTRPG is that you can do whatever you want within the logic of the game, not just narratively, but with how you maneuver in combat. Considering the limitations of a finite game, OS2 allows for a multitude of combat options that never feels limited, even though obviously it is to some extent. The environment is highly interactable and can be used to your advantage with dynamic and creative environmental conditions. Skills like teleport and various battlefield-warping abilities also do much more clever things beyond just dealing damage. There’s also the system of physical and magic armor that prevents conditions, adding a layer of complexity that encourages strategic play, even though it’s deceptively simple on the surface. I still felt like I had the variety of options available in a TTRPG, even if it was limited to a finite combination of options. It says a lot when being stuck on a given fight could be solved by a better approach rather than simply trying to level up.\n\nOther TTRPG elements deal with the world-building, story, and tone. There’s a rich world with lots of peoples with their own rich histories and varied proclivities, interacting with internal and external factions and nations with their own agendas. I like that the different peoples and factions aren’t the usual monoliths common to fantasy and demonstrate internal diversity. There’s plenty of lore to be explored in Rivellon that makes the stories and locations you encounter come to life.\n\nThe tone achieved by the narrative is also on point. One commonality to a lot of TTRPGs is a serious story that inevitably has some silliness as the players get up to some mischief or another. This leads to dramatic and intriguing storylines that are willing to step back for a moment of humor that (ideally) doesn’t break you out of the story. This is exactly how I’d describe OS2. The story is fairly serious and involves some dark themes at times, but at numerous points, especially side quests, there are amusing NPCs and conversations galore that never quite break the narrative but add a good deal of clever humor and even some laugh-out-loud moments without straying into the just plain goofy territory that pulls you from the narrative.\n\nThis isn’t the prettiest game I’ve played for its time, but still looks great and I think it’s balanced very well with the playstyle, offering vivid, immersive, appealing scenery that isn’t too confusing to navigate. The audio design is amazing. Sound effects are fine, but the soundtrack is superb. I generally dislike the sort of generic DnD folksy tavern style music that this soundtrack mostly fits into. But for whatever reason, these songs just click with me and never blend together like much of that kind of music usually does to me. If I hear a song from this game, I’ll recognize it immediately. Some tracks are better than others, but overall, they all work quite well. The vast majority of the massive script is also competently voiced, which is incredible.\n\nI found the story pretty strong. There is a main quest full of twists and turns, personal to your character that you must progress to move on with the game. There are a number of side quests as well, a staple of RPGs that can be really hit or miss. While not quite as good as some of the best side quests like Witcher 3, I think the side quests are generally very good. OS2 dodges dull fetch quests and “please kill the rats in my cellar” quests.

They are sidelining the community at every opportunity. They have a track record of hindering any and all attempts of their modding community at fixing their broken game and have shown actual jealousy over the work of their modding scene.\nAlmost two years ago TW proclaimed that custom, moddable servers can\'t be made now, but they\'ll be a thing in 2022, which prompted the modding community to making their own custom servers in few days of work, all by adding few lines of code. TW of course threw a hissy fit over it and patched it out, but it at least shown us how incompetent they are at their own jobs.\n""It\'s early access, you have to lower your expectations"" - My expectations are so low that I had to dig a hole for them to lay in.\nThis game should have never been released in Early Access. You need tons of mods to make it actually feel alive and fun, something which TW is actively hindering by throwing tantrums at all Total Conversion modders, because once again - players can do a better job than the actual devs.\nThis whole development process is a farce from start to finish. I honestly hope that when they (maybe) eventually release their 1.6, they\'ll adress all these issues and stop sidelining players with corpo-talk and tantrums.

Distant lands inhabited by dangerous armies, weapons warped into form by foreign designs. It was all exciting!\nThen my character became a man; a sword-wielding nemesis to all opposing. And in his adulthood he elected to realize his worldly infatuation. So he traveled to far places where the weather was cold and armor expensive, to places where men rode horses and shot from a bow. Finally he arrived to a place covered in sand and swarmed by furtive caravans. Here in the sweltering heat a primordial realization, shrouded at first by an unsteady open-mindedness, approached through the desert’s feverish waves. And here my character turned around and left; trading the dusty wastes for verdant forests.\n\n\tHe retired, after only a few weeks of conquest, to Sargot.

Your troops will only use one ladder, and even then only go up a hand full at a time which means they get immediately killed by the couple enemy troops waiting at the top. The rest of your troops are just kinda jumbled at the bottom of the tower all trying to climb the one ladder.... even though there are two more right next to it.

Even worse is the multiplayer side, the only official online modes are Skirmish and Captain, both of which became uninteresting very quickly.  Siege and Team Deathmatch still exist as custom options, but the servers themselves are programmed so poorly that you have about a 50/50 chance that the match will even finish without crashing, then a good 75% chance the server will crash between games.  Taleworlds has had so much time to work on this, yet the server stability has effectively remained the same since launch.  I love the fighting mechanics, I have since Warband, I played on a Napoleonic Wars battalion for a long time, but this has easily been the most disappointing addition to the franchise yet.', ""Its not finished and updates come at a snail's pace.

To mitigate that, the devs added a ""focus points"" which increases the cap/multiplier for a single skill only (max 5 focus per skill). You get 1 focus point per level, 1 attribute point per 4 levels. The progression is non-linear i.e. the higher the level of the character/skill, the more exp points it needs to progress - but you get LESS exp points due to the multiplier penalty. To eventually get max attributes, you\'d need to reach lvl 200-ish.\n\nIt is much more intuitive than it sounds. The key problem is that, to level up, you need to progress skills. But to progress skills you need to level up. The non-linear behaviour is TERRIBLY balanced. Even after cheating to get all attributes to 10 (max speed/cap to all skills), after ~40h my character is barely lvl 35 (remember, non-linear; so it gets much worse later).

They are sidelining the community at every opportunity. They have a track record of hindering any and all attempts of their modding community at fixing their broken game and have shown actual jealousy over the work of their modding scene.\nAlmost two years ago TW proclaimed that custom, moddable servers can\'t be made now, but they\'ll be a thing in 2022, which prompted the modding community to making their own custom servers in few days of work, all by adding few lines of code. TW of course threw a hissy fit over it and patched it out, but it at least shown us how incompetent they are at their own jobs.\n""It\'s early access, you have to lower your expectations"" - My expectations are so low that I had to dig a hole for them to lay in.\nThis game should have never been released in Early Access. You need tons of mods to make it actually feel alive and fun, something which TW is actively hindering by throwing tantrums at all Total Conversion modders, because once again - players can do a better job than the actual devs.\nThis whole development process is a farce from start to finish. I honestly hope that when they (maybe) eventually release their 1.6, they\'ll adress all these issues and stop sidelining players with corpo-talk and tantrums. But it\'s TaleWorlds, so the reality is that they\'re probably limiting our possibilities to milk us on future in-game-transactions and mediocre DLCs.\nI wish we got the same treatment Warband did with Viking Conquest, which was a joined project of both the developers and the community.\n\nForums topics I\'m referring to in the review are \'An open letter from the Kingdoms of Arda team, and the total-conversion mod community\' and \'Multiplayer mods can\'t be made until 2022 unless we find an alternative\', but there are literal hundreds other posts and topics there that show how out of touch and jaded the devs are.

Distant lands inhabited by dangerous armies, weapons warped into form by foreign designs. It was all exciting!\nThen my character became a man; a sword-wielding nemesis to all opposing. And in his adulthood he elected to realize his worldly infatuation. So he traveled to far places where the weather was cold and armor expensive, to places where men rode horses and shot from a bow. Finally he arrived to a place covered in sand and swarmed by furtive caravans. Here in the sweltering heat a primordial realization, shrouded at first by an unsteady open-mindedness, approached through the desert’s feverish waves.

Your troops will only use one ladder, and even then only go up a hand full at a time which means they get immediately killed by the couple enemy troops waiting at the top. The rest of your troops are just kinda jumbled at the bottom of the tower all trying to climb the one ladder.... even though there are two more right next to it.

Taleworlds has had so much time to work on this, yet the server stability has effectively remained the same since launch.

After tier two, it's like running into a brickwall to progress. At this point, spending money is almost necessary to unlock planes/tanks sanely. Since Patch 1.37 in Dec 2013, Gaijin completely overhauled the research system for the sole purpose to make more money off players. Since then, everything has increased in price, and reward amounts have dropped. Tanks, aircrafts, modifications, and crew proficiencies prices have all gone up, while RP points, silver lions, and crew points are capped and less abundant. \n\nBalance is utter crap too.

This game is testament that shitty devs can fuck up a very good game concept. I have played this game for a long time on and off. However, over the last few patches, the game really has taken a nosedive when it comes to enjoyability. \nFirst, the Planes, which is the most mature and well developed part of the game. the Models look great, as does the scenery. It however, has a lot of problems, first up, the way players interact with AI ground targets is mindnumbingly dumb. On each map, the AI has a predetermined winner, meaning, that without player intereference, one side will always win, as their ground units cap the objective. This is problem number one as it promotes hiding and drawing out the game, given everybody knows who wins on which maps, which means that 90% of the time, you end up chasing some AFK fuck that is lounging at 11k altitude without having done anything...\nThe Second major problem with planes is still, as it was in 1.25, Flight modelling. compared to the competition, its frankly terrible. Gaijin attempted to remedy this via ""Tournament standard"" flight models, but as a few tests indicate, even these are far from standard, with frankly mindboggling behavior such as a failure to stall, wonky control surfaces and odd use of superchargers. Compared to its next to competitors (IL-2 and Wargamings World of Warplanes) it falls miserably short compared to the first, while overall, not being that much better then the second, which advertises itself as a casual arcade type of sim. \nOverall, if Planes were the only thing, i\'d rate the game a 6.5/10, it can be decently enjoyable, if at times, mindnumbingly frustrating.\n\nNow onto Tanks. Which is the middle brother of the modes, and involves 2 teams usually fighting over a cap point. My first issue, cap points, unlike with planes, are completely random, consisting of a circle somewhere in the middle of nowhere, usually in the center of the map. Whereas with Planes, you got an inkling of what your actual goal is, tanks is akin to being a gladiator in an arena, with only a simple, go kill the badguys to justify your actions. This is made worse by the terrible, claustrofobic map design which is to promote the use of 1 shot killing Howitzers (that in most modes, would suffer heavily of hte shelldrop, combined with the need to guesstimate the distance) over high velocity anti tank guns. This is made even worse by the pitful zoom that you get, making putting in accurate fire at ranges over 500meters nearly impossible.\nThe second major issue, is the basic game mechanics of shell behavior and armor. Both are incredibly borked, and have been so from the beginning. for a Game that presents itself as historical and realistic, its very much neither. For instance, whereas In Real life, calibers of 85mm or more would overmatch sloped armor, ingame that doesn\'t happen except for huge calibers like the Soviet 122mm, which, combined with the aforementioned mapdesign, makes it really frustrating for anybody that wants to drive anything else then Russians. \nThe Ingame T-34 needs to plant a single hit on his opponent to kill him. the British Cromwell, which frequently faces it (and for some reason, has no reverse gear) needs to plant shots into each individual crewman, because shell spalling is only a minor inconvienience, whereas explosives are teh wrath of God.\nFinally, unlike WoT, the chance to bounce is not set, and is completely RNG to the point that HESH, which pancakes onto a surface, can actually bounce off an angled plate.\nrating 3/10. Horrible, buggy and frustrating, not helped by devs that are more interested in pushing out content then in fixing the mode.\n\nNow onto the devs themselves. They are bad, atleast their gamedesign is. Balance is a mess, with many over and underpowered machines sitting at ranks where they have no business to be. official response, ""balancing is done through numbers."" This has lead to the amusing situation where you had the A6M5 zero, an aircraft that has a top speed of 540kph was considered to be a balanced matchup for the P-80C shooting star, which went nearly twice as fast, had far better controls, and was supposed to go up to equivalent aircraft like the Meteor. While some of the more special ones have been removed, the point remains, there is no idea to balance it, and any suggestion about changing it is met with a resolute mocking and telling people that having biplanes facing off against B-17\'s is the only alternative.\nIn Tanks, its even worse, given that the spread is identical, which means that its not uncommon to find yourself in a position where you are outgunned and cannot do anything really, because of hte fact your gun cannot penetrate his armor from any angle. In Gaijin\'s view, this is considered a fair match.\n\n', 'There is only one word that I can say to describe this game...\n\n\n\n\nBoi.\n\n\n\nThis is definetly one of my top 5 Games to play list.

No matter which tier of tanks I'm in,  at least half of the tanks are the next tier which a majority of them my tanks barely damage while they can 1 hit mine and destroy them.

There has been many times where I've hit the other tank 7 or 8 times and not crippling it. If you cant get kills you cant advance your tanks hardly at all."", ""After 1,500+ hours in this game, I can safely say this game is utter trash. This game had so much potential but was wasted on a greedy company like gaijin who cares about money more than quallity or listening to the player base. The only saving factor of it is that no one else has made a game quite like it. Once I see a competent studio release such a game I will uninstall War Thunder that instant. War Thunder has a horrible grind for new vehicles that keeps getting added to every 1-2 months with new broken vehicles. They incentivise you to pay money to reduce the grind and yet don't fix the existing problems. The company is so greedy that they will not even stop at installing practically malware on your computer ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/5j221b/gaijinnet_agent/ ) that my best guess when running in the background tracks your data and uses it to advertize even more or sell to other companies for even more of a profit. This is a game riddled with problems that the development company doesnt bother fixing because they are too busy trying to make get more money out of the users whatever way they can. i would never recommend this game in the current state even after just going out of beta stage a few months ago. The top tier gameplay is tough to get to and broken to all hell once you get there. Avoid this game if you can.\n\n4,865 hours. game is still shit"", 'cool', 'War Thunder offers a great multiplayer experience of WW2/CW aerial and tank warfare. It has to be mentioned that visuals, gameplay and optimization are top notch. This game also features the best damage model I´ve encountered in a game of this sort. Hits and casualties are visualized with a unique picture-in-picture feedback which is very satisfying. Realistic and simulator mode are offered for people that look for the realistic fun which is a big pro.\n\nBut if you want to experience the great fidelity WT offers but aren´t willing to tone down your graphics to Playstation 1 90s standard in order to stay ""competitive"" then expect to have a big spotting disadvantage and also prepare to get blasted trough foliage, smoke and even solid objects. I don´t like to shout ""hax!"" and I don´t know how bad or good really the cheating situation is in War Thunder but take a look at the very low vs high graphic comparsion screenshots or get a impression for yourself and you´ll understand how people are able to pull of those shots. It is great that Gaijin also gives the low spec players the ability to participate but low graphic settings should never give you an advantage. I really hope Gayjin will fix that.\n\nAlso tank simulator fans may be disappointed that the tank warfare has not much to do with real tank operations. Many maps and objective placement force you to fight in tight places where everyone tries to ambush each other which unfortunately relies on heavy use of the 3p camera and gamey map marking. While this is of course fun I find the lack of big wide battlegrounds and real tank battles very frustrating. There are some maps that offer this experience but the community tend to avoid or dislike them because it takes too much time and patience for spotting and calculating a proper fire solution. Time that people want to spent with the grinding.  \n\nWhich bringes me to a big problem. This game suffers from horrible research points and silver lions grind from Tier 4 upwards even with premium account and boosting Talisman or premium vehicles. To all normal people that aren´t willing to spent their whole live on one game, that have careers, activites, sports, and social life to attend, be ready to wait a long time or to invest really big sums of money in order to see your favorite high tier tank in your garage. \n\nI´m okay with F2P games that ask you for some cash in order to save you time but this game has a absurd and greedy pricing. Monetization all over the place. Yeah die hard fans will tell you the grind isn´t that bad and paying money is not needed. Strangely most top tier players I´ve met have spent 200 - 300 dollars on average on this game for talismans, ingame currency, premium accounts, and vehicles. \n\nThe described cons sadly leaves a very bad impression and is the reason why I´m not getting in love with this game and have to give a negative rating. \n\nTo be fair it has to mentioned that there is at least no real pay to win in this game. You can purchase backup vehicles or buy camouflage objects but this has not much of an impact. More important is the fact that you can´t equip your vehicles with some premium boosters or powerful ammunitions for real money like in other games.  \n\nI´ll recommend you to aim for your favourite Tier 2/3 vehicles which are unlocked in a reasonable amount of time. Stay with this tiers, they´re really fun - gameplay and tank-mix wise - and stop worrying about the grind and the tier 5 but play the objective and for fun.', ""An excellent and unique game that gets worse and worse as time goes. Gaijin's lust and greed for $$$ has driven this game into an unenjoyable grindfest. After tier two, it's like running into a brickwall to progress. At this point, spending money is almost necessary to unlock planes/tanks sanely. Since Patch 1.37 in Dec 2013, Gaijin completely overhauled the research system for the sole purpose to make more money off players. Since then, everything has increased in price, and reward amounts have dropped. Tanks, aircrafts, modifications, and crew proficiencies prices have all gone up, while RP points, silver lions, and crew points are capped and less abundant. \n\nBalance is utter crap too.

They use what I feel like are Skinner Boxes to encourage the user to continue to play.\n\nSee:\n\nhttp://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/experienced-points/15510-Skinner-Boxes-and-How-Games-Use-Them\n\nFor a good explanation.\n\nRegardless don't play it and leave it alone. The game isn't worth the effort, I've wasted time and money on this until I realized just how dumb this shit is. . . \n\nFuck you Gaijin for the way you treat players."", ""To begin...\nDo not listen to the negative reviews about all the Russian bias because the developers are Russian.\n\nEvery country is good in their own way.\nFor example:\nAmericans: Large amount of ammo, mostly acrobatic, good offence, generally bad defence\nJapanese: Large amount of ammo, very acrobatic, good offence at higher calibres, very bad defence\nRussians: Low amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, defence spans from good to horrible depending on plane.\nBritish: Decent amount of ammo, acrobatic, good offence, average defence\nGermans: Large amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, average defence\n\n\n\nThe game mechanics in this game are very good. \nThe diversity of planes is very good.\nYou can play as army or aviation (tanks/ground vehicles or planes)\nDiverse selection of maps \nMany gamemodes\n\nThere are 3 levels of difficulty:\nArcade - Recomended for new players who are still getting a feel for the mechanics - includes lead indicator to assist aim and planes do not rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available - enemy and friendly players stand out\nRealistic - Recomended for seasoned players who understand the mechanics - does not include lead indicator, planes can rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available- friendly planes stand out, enemy planes must be close enough for the pilot to identify the type of plane\nSimulator - True realism - Recommended for expert players - does not include lead indicator - locked to first person - enemy and friendly planes are not distinguishable until the player can identify them - basically simulating the WW2 battles.\n\nThe game features a tree-like unlocking system, which includes 5 tiers of planes. As the tiers go higher so does the advancement of planes. There is an option to pay real money to unlock planes, however these planes can be unlocked without paying any extra money. There are also 'premium' planes, which can either be unlocked in bundles or bought. These planes cannot be unlocked without paying real money and also grant the user bonus experience from the plane. These planes grant little advantage to the user.\n\nThe matchmaking system depends on two things.\n1 - Tier of the plane\n2 - Battle Ranking of the plane\n\nIf you have a tier one plane - you will be matched with tier one planes, BUT if you have a tier one plane that has a Battle Ranking of 2.3, you will be matched with Tier one and Tier two planes, which have a battle ranking of 2-2.3. This system is continued throughout the entire game.\n\nTL;DR\nThe Russian Bias in this game is not anything crazy like the community has exaggerated it to be. Every country has its advantaged and disadvantages. The game is very expansive with its content and the mechanics are well made. The game has many difficulty levels targeted for new players and expert players. There are microtransactions however you will be at no disadvantage if you do not participate in them. The matchmaking system is dependant on Tier and Battle Ranking.\n\n"", 'WOULD U LIEK SOME LIFE INSURANCE YEAS?\n', ""Do you like to play a game where you can't see the enemy  that kills you because he is 2 km away and behind a tiny bush?\n\nWill you enjoy hours and hours of endless grind?\n\nDo you think that modern games are too easy!\n\nWelcome to war thunder where you will get f*cked in the a*s by the premium players and taken like a cheap pr*stitute by the pros!!"", ""I hate this game for horrible renditions of US bombers that fall apart after 1-2 shots.

This game is testament that shitty devs can fuck up a very good game concept. I have played this game for a long time on and off. However, over the last few patches, the game really has taken a nosedive when it comes to enjoyability. \nFirst, the Planes, which is the most mature and well developed part of the game. the Models look great, as does the scenery. It however, has a lot of problems, first up, the way players interact with AI ground targets is mindnumbingly dumb. On each map, the AI has a predetermined winner, meaning, that without player intereference, one side will always win, as their ground units cap the objective. This is problem number one as it promotes hiding and drawing out the game, given everybody knows who wins on which maps, which means that 90% of the time, you end up chasing some AFK fuck that is lounging at 11k altitude without having done anything...\nThe Second major problem with planes is still, as it was in 1.25, Flight modelling. compared to the competition, its frankly terrible. Gaijin attempted to remedy this via ""Tournament standard"" flight models, but as a few tests indicate, even these are far from standard, with frankly mindboggling behavior such as a failure to stall, wonky control surfaces and odd use of superchargers. Compared to its next to competitors (IL-2 and Wargamings World of Warplanes) it falls miserably short compared to the first, while overall, not being that much better then the second, which advertises itself as a casual arcade type of sim. \nOverall, if Planes were the only thing, i\'d rate the game a 6.5/10, it can be decently enjoyable, if at times, mindnumbingly frustrating.\n\nNow onto Tanks. Which is the middle brother of the modes, and involves 2 teams usually fighting over a cap point. My first issue, cap points, unlike with planes, are completely random, consisting of a circle somewhere in the middle of nowhere, usually in the center of the map. Whereas with Planes, you got an inkling of what your actual goal is, tanks is akin to being a gladiator in an arena, with only a simple, go kill the badguys to justify your actions. This is made worse by the terrible, claustrofobic map design which is to promote the use of 1 shot killing Howitzers (that in most modes, would suffer heavily of hte shelldrop, combined with the need to guesstimate the distance) over high velocity anti tank guns. This is made even worse by the pitful zoom that you get, making putting in accurate fire at ranges over 500meters nearly impossible.\nThe second major issue, is the basic game mechanics of shell behavior and armor. Both are incredibly borked, and have been so from the beginning. for a Game that presents itself as historical and realistic, its very much neither. For instance, whereas In Real life, calibers of 85mm or more would overmatch sloped armor, ingame that doesn\'t happen except for huge calibers like the Soviet 122mm, which, combined with the aforementioned mapdesign, makes it really frustrating for anybody that wants to drive anything else then Russians. \nThe Ingame T-34 needs to plant a single hit on his opponent to kill him. the British Cromwell, which frequently faces it (and for some reason, has no reverse gear) needs to plant shots into each individual crewman, because shell spalling is only a minor inconvienience, whereas explosives are teh wrath of God.\nFinally, unlike WoT, the chance to bounce is not set, and is completely RNG to the point that HESH, which pancakes onto a surface, can actually bounce off an angled plate.\nrating 3/10. Horrible, buggy and frustrating, not helped by devs that are more interested in pushing out content then in fixing the mode.\n\nNow onto the devs themselves. They are bad, atleast their gamedesign is. Balance is a mess, with many over and underpowered machines sitting at ranks where they have no business to be. official response, ""balancing is done through numbers."" This has lead to the amusing situation where you had the A6M5 zero, an aircraft that has a top speed of 540kph was considered to be a balanced matchup for the P-80C shooting star, which went nearly twice as fast, had far better controls, and was supposed to go up to equivalent aircraft like the Meteor. While some of the more special ones have been removed, the point remains, there is no idea to balance it, and any suggestion about changing it is met with a resolute mocking and telling people that having biplanes facing off against B-17\'s is the only alternative.\nIn Tanks, its even worse, given that the spread is identical, which means that its not uncommon to find yourself in a position where you are outgunned and cannot do anything really, because of hte fact your gun cannot penetrate his armor from any angle. In Gaijin\'s view, this is considered a fair match.\n\n', 'There is only one word that I can say to describe this game...\n\n\n\n\nBoi.\n\n\n\nThis is definetly one of my top 5 Games to play list. The realism is amazing, the physics are great, the use of the ultra-low graphic settings makes this game absolutely playable on a laptop (max fps I got for this game was 47 fps). \n\nDefinetly get this game', 'RUSSIAN BIAS', ""This game is very hard to advance in. No matter which tier of tanks I'm in,  at least half of the tanks are the next tier which a majority of them my tanks barely damage while they can 1 hit mine and destroy them. I was in tier 2 with 5 tanks to choose from. I was fighting tier 3 tanks the majority of the time. Finally I managed to get 3 tier 3 tanks and when I go to battle I'm fighting tier 4 tanks. There has been many times where I've hit the other tank 7 or 8 times and not crippling it. If you cant get kills you cant advance your tanks hardly at all."", ""After 1,500+ hours in this game, I can safely say this game is utter trash. This game had so much potential but was wasted on a greedy company like gaijin who cares about money more than quallity or listening to the player base. The only saving factor of it is that no one else has made a game quite like it. Once I see a competent studio release such a game I will uninstall War Thunder that instant. War Thunder has a horrible grind for new vehicles that keeps getting added to every 1-2 months with new broken vehicles. They incentivise you to pay money to reduce the grind and yet don't fix the existing problems. The company is so greedy that they will not even stop at installing practically malware on your computer ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/5j221b/gaijinnet_agent/ ) that my best guess when running in the background tracks your data and uses it to advertize even more or sell to other companies for even more of a profit. This is a game riddled with problems that the development company doesnt bother fixing because they are too busy trying to make get more money out of the users whatever way they can. i would never recommend this game in the current state even after just going out of beta stage a few months ago. The top tier gameplay is tough to get to and broken to all hell once you get there. Avoid this game if you can.\n\n4,865 hours. game is still shit"", 'cool', 'War Thunder offers a great multiplayer experience of WW2/CW aerial and tank warfare. It has to be mentioned that visuals, gameplay and optimization are top notch. This game also features the best damage model I´ve encountered in a game of this sort. Hits and casualties are visualized with a unique picture-in-picture feedback which is very satisfying. Realistic and simulator mode are offered for people that look for the realistic fun which is a big pro.\n\nBut if you want to experience the great fidelity WT offers but aren´t willing to tone down your graphics to Playstation 1 90s standard in order to stay ""competitive"" then expect to have a big spotting disadvantage and also prepare to get blasted trough foliage, smoke and even solid objects. I don´t like to shout ""hax!"" and I don´t know how bad or good really the cheating situation is in War Thunder but take a look at the very low vs high graphic comparsion screenshots or get a impression for yourself and you´ll understand how people are able to pull of those shots. It is great that Gaijin also gives the low spec players the ability to participate but low graphic settings should never give you an advantage. I really hope Gayjin will fix that.\n\nAlso tank simulator fans may be disappointed that the tank warfare has not much to do with real tank operations. Many maps and objective placement force you to fight in tight places where everyone tries to ambush each other which unfortunately relies on heavy use of the 3p camera and gamey map marking. While this is of course fun I find the lack of big wide battlegrounds and real tank battles very frustrating. There are some maps that offer this experience but the community tend to avoid or dislike them because it takes too much time and patience for spotting and calculating a proper fire solution. Time that people want to spent with the grinding.  \n\nWhich bringes me to a big problem. This game suffers from horrible research points and silver lions grind from Tier 4 upwards even with premium account and boosting Talisman or premium vehicles. To all normal people that aren´t willing to spent their whole live on one game, that have careers, activites, sports, and social life to attend, be ready to wait a long time or to invest really big sums of money in order to see your favorite high tier tank in your garage. \n\nI´m okay with F2P games that ask you for some cash in order to save you time but this game has a absurd and greedy pricing. Monetization all over the place. Yeah die hard fans will tell you the grind isn´t that bad and paying money is not needed. Strangely most top tier players I´ve met have spent 200 - 300 dollars on average on this game for talismans, ingame currency, premium accounts, and vehicles. \n\nThe described cons sadly leaves a very bad impression and is the reason why I´m not getting in love with this game and have to give a negative rating. \n\nTo be fair it has to mentioned that there is at least no real pay to win in this game. You can purchase backup vehicles or buy camouflage objects but this has not much of an impact. More important is the fact that you can´t equip your vehicles with some premium boosters or powerful ammunitions for real money like in other games.  \n\nI´ll recommend you to aim for your favourite Tier 2/3 vehicles which are unlocked in a reasonable amount of time. Stay with this tiers, they´re really fun - gameplay and tank-mix wise - and stop worrying about the grind and the tier 5 but play the objective and for fun.']"

Dyson Sphere Program,Simulation,1366540,"[""I've tried out a decent few factory games before, and none of them have come even remotely close to catching my interest as much as Dyson Sphere Program. Factorio, for example, is a pretty clever game, and I don't mean to knock it, but I quickly lost interest because it didn't really feel as though there was anything cool to work towards. As in, it felt like the purpose of the factory was just the factory itself. There may have been some hazy end goal, but there was nothing in between to spark my awe- just endless automation.\n\nDyson Sphere Program takes the creative problem-solving/logistics planning aspects of the factory game genre and just, in my humble opinion, sparks it to its fullest potential (almost- there is always room for improvement, but we'll get there). In this game, you aren't [i]just[/i] automating things to be as efficient and organized and convenient as possible- you're still doing plenty of that of course, but along the way you also get to build incredible sci-fi devices. Launching thousands of solar sails to orbit around your nearest star to gather energy for you, upgrading your mech to travel between solar systems at warp speed, building vast networks of automated drones to deliver resources between planets for you- it's not solely about the planning, there are also actual moments of cathartic, exciting payoff that come to you frequently by just being an immensely cool game on a conceptual level.\n\nIf you are new to the genre (I am relatively new considering I gave up on others before overcoming their main hurdles), this game will be challenging to approach. I distinctly remember a point about six or so hours in where I [i]almost[/i] gave up and quit because I felt like there was just too much stuff to figure out at once and I didn't know my next step and I just had no idea where to go next. But I stuck it out and just started researching the coolest looking thing, and the next day (a weekend) ten hours went by of me playing and hardly noticing. So basically what you should take from this is that you should go into this game with the determination to overcome a steep learning curve, or just recognize that it's probably not your cup of tea.\n\nNow, the negatives. I personally find space travel annoying and stressful. Being trapped in space, drifting into an infinite void with no hope in sight, scares me on a deep psychological level, so when I have to travel between planets with nothing but a finite tank of fuel and the possibility that I might accidentally miss my target and be slingshotted around its orbit into vast darkness, the rational part of my brain tells me I can just load a save, but the ape part of my brain is annoyed that my management game is now a horror game. I'd like a technology in the research tree that can shuttle the player automatically between planets, mostly for my own sanity.\n\nThe second thing is mostly a Early Access-type thing that I'm sure will be improved on in the future- I want more endgame tech to exist, like the ability to destroy entire planets to gain all their resources in one fell swoop, or create wormholes for instant teleportation between points in space, or create entire planet-sized space stations (yeah 2/3 of those suggestions is just describing the Death Star, deal with it); things like that which actually require access to the immense energy of a Dyson Sphere will add a ton more spice to the game (which of course already has plenty, but there can never be too much).\n\nThe final thing is actually something that is not in the game yet but will be- please don't add combat. I know I'm probably in the minority here but the game is complex enough without that on top of it. Maybe as like, a rare event in specific locations it would be fine but for it to be a constant nuisance that threatens to destroy parts of one's factory at any moment is just too annoying to even think about.\n\nAll in all, game looks visually incredible, haven't noticed a single substantial bug, very complex and interesting to play. If the idea of creating vast automatic factories that can create anything you want on a whim and can span multiple planets, with the goal of turning entire stars into your own personal generator intrigues you, I highly recommend giving this a try."", ""I have over 300 hours in this game, often playing it all day long.

Football Manager 2021,Sports,1263850,"['if u like crack then football manager is for u', 'I finally upgraded to FM21 after skipping FM19 & 20 - mostly it was the xG feature that piqued my interest, but I also like to update every so often for little things like competition rule/qualification changes, refreshing rosters, etc. Coming from FM18, I\'ve been pleasantly surprised at some of the new features added in FM21 - not only do I really enjoy the xG thing, I love the overall improvement in what I\'d call ""realism"": The interaction with staff continues to get better and better, the way staff and management present you with reports and call meetings is awesome, and the scouting meetings before transfer windows are so damn cool. It all combines to make you feel like you\'re actually a manager and not just playing a game. I\'m at around 230 hours of FM21 and I\'m still constantly finding myself engaging with new things. \n\nLast, I\'d just like to share my experience/thoughts on scum-saving. For the most part during my thousands of hours of FM over the years, I felt like I was pretty fair about reloading matches - I only tended to do it if I had a bad injury to a star I\'d just signed, or conceded a BS glitch/bug goal, etc. Sometimes if I was having a bad day and fired up FM only to be down 4-0 to Man City in the 35th minute I\'d just Ctl-Alt-Delete and replay the match a few days later. But with my new save in FM21, I\'ve been experimenting with a strict no-save-scumming policy, and it\'s added a whole new compelling element to my gameplay. I had a real stinker of a game against Newcastle (5-0 I think) - the sort of game I\'d have been tempted to reload in the past - and a day later my players refunded the supporters\' tickets for the match. How cool is that!? I also got to within one bad result of getting sacked, and had to get something away at Sheffield Utd - what a nerve-racking match that was! My boys pulled out a 3-1 win to keep me alive, and we had a short run of good form to finish the season, allowing me to get the transfer reinforcements I desperately needed. \n\nSo TL;DR: FM is hands down the best sports management sim on the market, I felt it was well worth the money to upgrade from FM18 to FM21, and if you\'ve never experimented with a no-save-scum policy - give it a whirl. I think you\'ll find it rewarding.', 'Football Manager 2021 hasn’t really rocked the boat in terms of enhancing the matchday gaming experience from last year. Games are as  difficult as ever to manage, and the minutiae of detail is just as overwhelming as always. Rather than a complete overhaul, there are numerous minor tweaks in Football Manager 2021, affecting tactical exploration and simulation. This time around, energy levels in particular seem to play a greater role, presumably to combat previously effective pressing tactics. In other words,  you can’t rely on your tried-and-tested methods from last year to get by.\n\nFootball Manager 2021‘s biggest change seems to come in the way that you, as a Manager, communicate. Gone are the meaningless emotions while addressing people; instead, your decisions are broken down into what really matters. While talking to players, the boardroom or press, you can respond in a much more clear way. You’ll be able to choose from responses that are positive, negative, convincing, or even backing down. Better yet, the intended meaning of everything you say is clearly laid out.\n\nThe communication overhaul really adds a lot to how you are judged as a manager in Football Manager 2021. Yes, results are still important, but you can really change the parameters of what your personal success is. If you aren’t doing especially well but are achieving the promises you have set out, you will be given more time.\n\nThis happened to me; in my first season of managing, I had slightly underachieved. But because I had delivered on my promise to repair the financial damage of the over bloated squad, I wasn’t kicked out at the end of the season where I might’ve been in previous instalments. The next season, having been able to gain control of the finances, I was able to cultivate success. This is a new experience for me in a Football Manager game; a series I’ve been playing for over a decade. While I may have improved the finances of a club before, I have never overtly communicated my goals to the boardroom and insisted on time to deliver.\n\nFootball Manager 2021 has done something that great managers do: it has acknowledged its weaknesses and improved upon them without completely rocking the boat. It still feels truly familiar as a Football Manager game, but the overhaul to expectations and communication makes for a more coherent and impactful experience. There’s more of a focus on what you say and do in your role as a manager and, over seasons, your performance is better judged. It makes a real difference to how the game can play out. The matchday experience may not be massively improved, but the improved focus elsewhere makes a real difference. For anyone who truly likes to get into the role of manager, Football Manager 2021 is a must.', ""Football manager 2021 is another great hit that again showcases as poor the Fifa games currently are.\n\nThis game provides a fair and balanced system which lets you do well if you know what your doing and are prepared for opposition but if you try and speed it: you get really something back for being bad.\n\nI enjoy the ethic of always improving. I feel very immersed and determined to become a better manager. For example, I had a bad playoff season with Nashville in the MLS. I got so annoyed because we lost to a trash team so I berated the players and got rid of dead wood. I then signed top prospects and I'm now in the running of finishing 1st in the supporter's shield.\n\nI love this game. It's hard at first but honestly give it a shot and once you have a good graspe of the game, you'll become Arsene Wenger's invincibles."", ""Imagine playing Leeds on the final day of the season as Brighton manager. Your best player and top goalscorer is missing through injury. You must beat Leeds to win the league after an outstanding season. its 0-0 but then Leeds strike in the 67th minute to go 1-0 up. You begin your heart starting to break. But then out of nowhere, Lewis Dunk rises from a corner on the 79th minute to equalise. There's a glimmer of hope restored. Man Utd fans hear of your equaliser in their game and become anxious. The 90th minute arrives and its still 1-1. You can hear Man Utd's fans celebrating already. You have a freekick on the edge of the box though ..... MacAllister steps up. ITS IN!!!!! Its the last kick off the game!! The beer you have in your hand which was meant to drown your sorrows goes everywhere in celebration, including over your best suit which you was wearing because its such an iconic moment in Brighton FC's history!\n\nThis is what this game gives you. Moments like this!"", ""It pains me to write this but after spending more than 400 hours I have to admit: it's a poorly designed game with artifical difficulty spikes designed to keep players engaged. You can be the by far best team in the league and you will always have a seasonal rival (undocumented in-game) which will keep the pace with you. You can be a heavy-weight in a small league and there will be a team which is not better than any other in competitions which will go with the same results as you. \n\nWorst part when the game decides that it should boost your real rival. I have just one example of it: playing in UPL with Shakhtar I managed to finish the season with 28 wins and 2 draws in the 30 games. Guess what was the gap with Dynamo Kiev? 2 points. The third place was like 20 points lower. A season before I lost the league to Vorskla - it had lost points in 4 games through the whole season and my only loss was to them. I had numerous finishings in previous seasons with different teams when on the last match day the leader was losing, my team coming second won and then the third team became the first on goal difference, winning 5-0 and scoring its last goal on the last minutes in injury time. I get that it happens in football, see Man City and Aguero, but not in the course of couple of seasons in a row.\n\nApart of that the game is addicting as ever although SI doesn't care for bug fixing (top managers have like perpetual contracts, in my 15 season save Simeone, Conte, OGS, Pochettino and Flick ALL were managing their starting cubs) and their UI designer clearly hates people - I can't find any reason to make the UI overloaded mess in dark purple color. In 2021 SI didn't even care to add additional skins leaving it to fans. Really, you become so lazy? You had to tweak a couple of lines of code to do that.\n\nMatch engine looks much better until you realize that it relies heavily on the patterns. If you get that patterns, you can exploit it, and if you want to keep it natural you will face artificial difficulty spikes. Maybe in 2000s it was the same, I don't know, it all felt like an unscripted free flow and now you can guess the outcome of episode 90% times the 3D field appears.\n\nTactics make no sense, as you can't play defensive football relying to soak the pressure - it's instantly punished by the opposition. Players with 5 in long shots suddenly pull of Roberto Carlos if you play defensive and there is no way to explain it but the match engine flaws. If the game decides that it's time to score, it will score. To play attacking you should do counter-intuitive things (deep defensive line and low pressure against the last team in a league is a must or you will be heavily beaten with the magic 30-meter screamers).\n\nOn top of that you have the SI community forums with extremely gatekeeping audience which is intolerable to any criticism of their game. Moderators delete negative comments claiming they welcome meaningful discussion and constructive criticism. Like, I'm a paying customer who gets banned for stating that I'm not that happy with what I've payed for. In all my years online I've never seen more toxic and hostile community - even Reddit is friendly and supportive in comparison. Think twice before sponsoring it. I was a big fan of FM in 2005 - 2012 editions, I haven't really played for 8 years and I had over 700 extremely frustrating and unrewarding hours in 2020/21 versions. I won't buy it before they fix the UI and fire their UI designer. I can't possibly recommend the game which is made with the goal to frustrate the players and encourage exploits."", 'ive played 192 hours', ""It kills me to have to give this a thumbs down, as there have been so many excellent improvements in the 20 and 21 editions of this great game.

In a nutshell: Goal was to finish in Euro Cup places, finished 6th. Lucky to survive the sack, a couple days later I've qualified for the Euro cup because Top 4 teams won the 2 domestic cups.

I had a real stinker of a game against Newcastle (5-0 I think) - the sort of game I\'d have been tempted to reload in the past - and a day later my players refunded the supporters\' tickets for the match. How cool is that!? I also got to within one bad result of getting sacked, and had to get something away at Sheffield Utd - what a nerve-racking match that was! My boys pulled out a 3-1 win to keep me alive, and we had a short run of good form to finish the season, allowing me to get the transfer reinforcements I desperately needed. \n\nSo TL;DR: FM is hands down the best sports management sim on the market, I felt it was well worth the money to upgrade from FM18 to FM21, and if you\'ve never experimented with a no-save-scum policy - give it a whirl. I think you\'ll find it rewarding.', 'Football Manager 2021 hasn’t really rocked the boat in terms of enhancing the matchday gaming experience from last year. Games are as  difficult as ever to manage, and the minutiae of detail is just as overwhelming as always. Rather than a complete overhaul, there are numerous minor tweaks in Football Manager 2021, affecting tactical exploration and simulation. This time around, energy levels in particular seem to play a greater role, presumably to combat previously effective pressing tactics. In other words,  you can’t rely on your tried-and-tested methods from last year to get by.\n\nFootball Manager 2021‘s biggest change seems to come in the way that you, as a Manager, communicate. Gone are the meaningless emotions while addressing people; instead, your decisions are broken down into what really matters. While talking to players, the boardroom or press, you can respond in a much more clear way. You’ll be able to choose from responses that are positive, negative, convincing, or even backing down. Better yet, the intended meaning of everything you say is clearly laid out.\n\nThe communication overhaul really adds a lot to how you are judged as a manager in Football Manager 2021. Yes, results are still important, but you can really change the parameters of what your personal success is. If you aren’t doing especially well but are achieving the promises you have set out, you will be given more time.\n\nThis happened to me; in my first season of managing, I had slightly underachieved. But because I had delivered on my promise to repair the financial damage of the over bloated squad, I wasn’t kicked out at the end of the season where I might’ve been in previous instalments. The next season, having been able to gain control of the finances, I was able to cultivate success. This is a new experience for me in a Football Manager game; a series I’ve been playing for over a decade. While I may have improved the finances of a club before, I have never overtly communicated my goals to the boardroom and insisted on time to deliver.\n\nFootball Manager 2021 has done something that great managers do: it has acknowledged its weaknesses and improved upon them without completely rocking the boat. It still feels truly familiar as a Football Manager game, but the overhaul to expectations and communication makes for a more coherent and impactful experience. There’s more of a focus on what you say and do in your role as a manager and, over seasons, your performance is better judged. It makes a real difference to how the game can play out. The matchday experience may not be massively improved, but the improved focus elsewhere makes a real difference. For anyone who truly likes to get into the role of manager, Football Manager 2021 is a must.', ""Football manager 2021 is another great hit that again showcases as poor the Fifa games currently are.\n\nThis game provides a fair and balanced system which lets you do well if you know what your doing and are prepared for opposition but if you try and speed it: you get really something back for being bad.\n\nI enjoy the ethic of always improving. I feel very immersed and determined to become a better manager. For example, I had a bad playoff season with Nashville in the MLS. I got so annoyed because we lost to a trash team so I berated the players and got rid of dead wood. I then signed top prospects and I'm now in the running of finishing 1st in the supporter's shield.\n\nI love this game. It's hard at first but honestly give it a shot and once you have a good graspe of the game, you'll become Arsene Wenger's invincibles."", ""Imagine playing Leeds on the final day of the season as Brighton manager. Your best player and top goalscorer is missing through injury. You must beat Leeds to win the league after an outstanding season. its 0-0 but then Leeds strike in the 67th minute to go 1-0 up. You begin your heart starting to break. But then out of nowhere, Lewis Dunk rises from a corner on the 79th minute to equalise. There's a glimmer of hope restored. Man Utd fans hear of your equaliser in their game and become anxious. The 90th minute arrives and its still 1-1. You can hear Man Utd's fans celebrating already. You have a freekick on the edge of the box though ..... MacAllister steps up. ITS IN!!!!! Its the last kick off the game!! The beer you have in your hand which was meant to drown your sorrows goes everywhere in celebration, including over your best suit which you was wearing because its such an iconic moment in Brighton FC's history!\n\nThis is what this game gives you. Moments like this!"", ""It pains me to write this but after spending more than 400 hours I have to admit: it's a poorly designed game with artifical difficulty spikes designed to keep players engaged. You can be the by far best team in the league and you will always have a seasonal rival (undocumented in-game) which will keep the pace with you. You can be a heavy-weight in a small league and there will be a team which is not better than any other in competitions which will go with the same results as you. \n\nWorst part when the game decides that it should boost your real rival. I have just one example of it: playing in UPL with Shakhtar I managed to finish the season with 28 wins and 2 draws in the 30 games. Guess what was the gap with Dynamo Kiev? 2 points. The third place was like 20 points lower. A season before I lost the league to Vorskla - it had lost points in 4 games through the whole season and my only loss was to them. I had numerous finishings in previous seasons with different teams when on the last match day the leader was losing, my team coming second won and then the third team became the first on goal difference, winning 5-0 and scoring its last goal on the last minutes in injury time. I get that it happens in football, see Man City and Aguero, but not in the course of couple of seasons in a row.\n\nApart of that the game is addicting as ever although SI doesn't care for bug fixing (top managers have like perpetual contracts, in my 15 season save Simeone, Conte, OGS, Pochettino and Flick ALL were managing their starting cubs) and their UI designer clearly hates people - I can't find any reason to make the UI overloaded mess in dark purple color. In 2021 SI didn't even care to add additional skins leaving it to fans. Really, you become so lazy? You had to tweak a couple of lines of code to do that.\n\nMatch engine looks much better until you realize that it relies heavily on the patterns. If you get that patterns, you can exploit it, and if you want to keep it natural you will face artificial difficulty spikes. Maybe in 2000s it was the same, I don't know, it all felt like an unscripted free flow and now you can guess the outcome of episode 90% times the 3D field appears.\n\nTactics make no sense, as you can't play defensive football relying to soak the pressure - it's instantly punished by the opposition. Players with 5 in long shots suddenly pull of Roberto Carlos if you play defensive and there is no way to explain it but the match engine flaws. If the game decides that it's time to score, it will score. To play attacking you should do counter-intuitive things (deep defensive line and low pressure against the last team in a league is a must or you will be heavily beaten with the magic 30-meter screamers).\n\nOn top of that you have the SI community forums with extremely gatekeeping audience which is intolerable to any criticism of their game. Moderators delete negative comments claiming they welcome meaningful discussion and constructive criticism. Like, I'm a paying customer who gets banned for stating that I'm not that happy with what I've payed for. In all my years online I've never seen more toxic and hostile community - even Reddit is friendly and supportive in comparison. Think twice before sponsoring it. I was a big fan of FM in 2005 - 2012 editions, I haven't really played for 8 years and I had over 700 extremely frustrating and unrewarding hours in 2020/21 versions. I won't buy it before they fix the UI and fire their UI designer. I can't possibly recommend the game which is made with the goal to frustrate the players and encourage exploits."", 'ive played 192 hours', ""It kills me to have to give this a thumbs down, as there have been so many excellent improvements in the 20 and 21 editions of this great game. But yet again one of the most basic, fundamental and important parts of the game are broken. I posted the same for FM20, and never had these isssues with any of the previous versions. In a nutshell: Goal was to finish in Euro Cup places, finished 6th. Lucky to survive the sack, a couple days later I've qualified for the Euro cup because Top 4 teams won the 2 domestic cups.

The thing with simulation games is that unless you have an interest in the thing being simulated (in this case football) then you will struggle to keep interest, at the same time though most of the fun in this games in my experience comes form the stories and attachments you make to the players and clubs you manage, especially the youth players you get in your yearly youth intake.']"

DJMAX RESPECT V,Sports,960170,"['New players BEWARE!\n\nThere are a lot of other negative reviews of this game, and I think they\'re all very spot on, but I want to touch on something that not many folks here in the reviews are mentioning which is:\n\nThis game is incredibly anti-newcomer. Yes, it looks pretty. Yes, it looks assessable... but beware, because if you purchase this game as a person new to rhythm games looking to get better at them, then you\'re in the wrong place and you better reconsider and look at playing a free alternative(like OSU!Mania). \n\nThis is the biggest thing that bugs me about DJMAX.\n\nIt\'s honestly such a slap in the face when you come to realization that the only way you can even hope to get better at the game is to stagnantly repeat songs in freestyle that you\'re comfortable with and slowly move up. Yes, you do get better over time, but I have to argue here that this isn\'t any effective nor efficient training for the time and effort you put in. NO player wants to feel like they\'re stuck in a game since that would defeat the purpose of a game being a game, and lol guess what, neowiz is doing exactly that for the newcomers\n\nThere\'s absolutely no way to practice this game efficiently. If you find a song that has only a really hard part towards the end of the track then guess what, you\'re outta luck. You can play freestyle mode and just keep failing until you get it sometime in the uncertain future I guess... If you really want to practice that part then you\'d have to go search YT videos and tap along to a video which I find to be completely inconvenient. Air mode is also a \'no fail\' mode, BUT you can\'t really choose a song you want. And online player lobbies are good option as it is a no fail mode, but you kinda need friends, and I have none :(\n\nAll the options I listed above are just not convenient or efficient at all. When I say ""practice/train"", I mean that I would like to sit down and hard practice complex patterns on very low BPM(not low note speed) and slowly raise it until I get it embedded into my muscle memory, and it really frustrates me that I\'m not able to have the convenience of a training mode that could really facilitate more motivation and time spent playing the game. Even free games like OSU!Mania has the song map editor where you can actually slow down the BPM of a track to practice, I don\'t see why a paid game cant include this simple feature as well.\n\nIt\'s funny ya know, you would think an online only game like DJMAX would have more than just pretty colors/anime/weeb art to attract casual players like simply including an effective way to practice would be a good start to help bring more revenue, recognition, and a bigger playerbase to this already niche genre...\n\nMaybe they should\'ve thought about this instead of focusing on an useless ranked mode(that no one plays btw) and shoving xigncode3 down our throats...\n\nOutside of this, it\'s a good game really, but I think the game has like no replay value at all if you aren\'t very good at rhythm games to begin with.\n\n', ""Very good game, it's really fun and I would recommend it!\nAlthough I think it's too expensive compared too other rythm games, especially osu mania, and I do think there's better rythm games overall.

Buy normal game first, it has plenty of songs to unlock free and there are pack sales so get what you want later if you enjoy the game. ^_^', ""The best rhythm game you don't have to go to Round 1 to play"", 'New players BEWARE!\n\nThere are a lot of other negative reviews of this game, and I think they\'re all very spot on, but I want to touch on something that not many folks here in the reviews are mentioning which is:\n\nThis game is incredibly anti-newcomer. Yes, it looks pretty. Yes, it looks assessable... but beware, because if you purchase this game as a person new to rhythm games looking to get better at them, then you\'re in the wrong place and you better reconsider and look at playing a free alternative(like OSU!Mania). \n\nThis is the biggest thing that bugs me about DJMAX.\n\nIt\'s honestly such a slap in the face when you come to realization that the only way you can even hope to get better at the game is to stagnantly repeat songs in freestyle that you\'re comfortable with and slowly move up. Yes, you do get better over time, but I have to argue here that this isn\'t any effective nor efficient training for the time and effort you put in. NO player wants to feel like they\'re stuck in a game since that would defeat the purpose of a game being a game, and lol guess what, neowiz is doing exactly that for the newcomers\n\nThere\'s absolutely no way to practice this game efficiently. If you find a song that has only a really hard part towards the end of the track then guess what, you\'re outta luck. You can play freestyle mode and just keep failing until you get it sometime in the uncertain future I guess... If you really want to practice that part then you\'d have to go search YT videos and tap along to a video which I find to be completely inconvenient. Air mode is also a \'no fail\' mode, BUT you can\'t really choose a song you want. And online player lobbies are good option as it is a no fail mode, but you kinda need friends, and I have none :(\n\nAll the options I listed above are just not convenient or efficient at all. When I say ""practice/train"", I mean that I would like to sit down and hard practice complex patterns on very low BPM(not low note speed) and slowly raise it until I get it embedded into my muscle memory, and it really frustrates me that I\'m not able to have the convenience of a training mode that could really facilitate more motivation and time spent playing the game. Even free games like OSU!Mania has the song map editor where you can actually slow down the BPM of a track to practice, I don\'t see why a paid game cant include this simple feature as well.\n\nIt\'s funny ya know, you would think an online only game like DJMAX would have more than just pretty colors/anime/weeb art to attract casual players like simply including an effective way to practice would be a good start to help bring more revenue, recognition, and a bigger playerbase to this already niche genre...\n\nMaybe they should\'ve thought about this instead of focusing on an useless ranked mode(that no one plays btw) and shoving xigncode3 down our throats...\n\nOutside of this, it\'s a good game really, but I think the game has like no replay value at all if you aren\'t very good at rhythm games to begin with.\n\n', ""Very good game, it's really fun and I would recommend it!\nAlthough I think it's too expensive compared too other rythm games, especially osu mania, and I do think there's better rythm games overall.

A little bit wacky, fun, unique style and definitely a jewel for TD gamers. \n\n[h1]Non-TLDR[/h1]\nBloons TD 6 (BTD 6), developed and published by Ninja Kiwi. The PC version was relased on Dec 17, 2018 and it is also available on the Iphone/Ipad. On Metacritic (https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bloons-td-6) it has:\n[list]\n    [*]0 Metascore from critic reviews\n    [*]An average user score of 7.4 from 30 ratings\n[/list]\n\nIf you\'ve played Flash games before, you\'d probably come across bloon td. if you are someone who loves tower defense games, you\'d probably slay a ton of bloons before ninja kiwi (and other flash game developers) migrated to steam because Flash is no longer supported by Adobe. So these group of people have seen how bloon td evolved till today. \n\nAs for the younger generations, this may seem like some wild, crazy, mess up monkey revenge business against balloons. Did i mention that it was also fun/can be frustrating at the same time?\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nBTD 6 offers players 40 over maps to play. it comes in 3 difficulty and each difficulty has different set of challenges - that will test your skill and knowledge. For some odd reasons, BTD 6 has a complicated map system for online/co-op game play. \n\n[list]\n    [*]You can\'t play online or co-op under the [u]standard[/u] ""play"" game. \n    [*]Daily challenges are strictly solo.\n    [*]Co-op challenges can be played with friends/others over the internet.\n    [*]Co-op can only be played in co-op maps.\n    [*]There are 2 variations of co-op maps:\n[olist]\n    [*]Play the entire map\n    [*]Play in 1 of the sections of the map\n[/olist]\n    [*]Other events/Challenges are strictly solo.\n[/list]\n\nYour towers have it\'s own leveling system. Aside from that, the more you play, you also gain up exp for your own account - this is the monkey knowledge system. As you level up, you gain monkey knowledge points which can be used to purchase ""perks"" for your towers or heroes tower. Yes, there are heroes tower which needs to be unlocked & purchased (not microtrans). If i am not mistaken, the first 2 heroes can be unlocked and given to you after you reach certain levels.\n\nOther than all of the above, you now have:\n[list]\n    [*]Powers = non-towers that can be placed on to the map to assist you in various ways.\n    [*]Insta towers = free towers that you have acquire through challenges/events. These towers come with certain upgrades already.\n[/list]\n\nOn top of all of this, it has a trophy store, where you can purchase various in-game elements; visuals/ui/emoticons. Nothing that can affect the gameplay. You earn trophy from odyssey game mode. finally, it has a microtransaction shop.\n\nBTD 6 isn\'t just your standard Tower Defense game with all this features.\n\n[h1]Controls, Audio, Visuals[/h1]\nVisuals: It\'s 3d\'ish looking. colorful, clean. certain maps have objects to interact/block your line of sight. Monkeys and bloons have been properly designed. no complains. +1 to the team\n\nAudio: Energetic vibe. I believe you can purchase additional soundtrack from the trophy store. (yet to try). There\'s a jukebox to enable. +1 to the team\n\nControls: Mouse. For more advanced/hardcore gamers, you can use keyboard keys.\n\n[h1]Mechanics[/h1]\nAs a tower defense game, your goal is to prevent the bloons from exiting the map. If it does, your life will be deducted. Once you lose all of your life, the game ends. At this point, you can either replay from scratch or use monkey cash to re-try again. \n\nWhat makes BTD 6 complicated is the difficulty and what game mode you are playing on. A standard easy vs Deflation easy is 2 totally different game mode while they share the ""common"" easy rules. Same concept applies to the other difficulty/harder maps. \n\nOn the surface it may seem like all the maps and bloons are the same. So, what exactly makes the game ""harder""?\nThe first criteria is the game mode which you are playing. It will set the tone on how hard/what sort of challenge you will be presented. (1 hp game, magicians tower only, reverse path, half cash etc)\n\nThe second criteria is the difficulty levels. On a general note, the higher difficulty you play, you will be required to play more levels. easy: 40 levels. medium 60. hard 80. you will encounter much harder bloon types (mix and match from various properties: camo, ceramic, metal, rainbow, regrow, FORTIFIED! etc). The bloon type is what dictates ""how hard the game"" will be. \n\nIn order to beat hard maps, you will definitely need to max out your tower levels and invest into monkey knowledge. Heroes are not prominent until you start to play on hard maps or you have a particular way of playing/sync it with other towers.\n\nThe tower themselves are unique and depending on your style of play, you can mix and match certain tower styles. In this sense it gives flexibility to the players - some may opt of the ninja tower but others prefer the sniper. \n\n[h1]My personal thoughts/My Summary[/h1]\nBloon TD has come a long way. I wouldn\'t say BTD 6 has revolutionize tower defense games but it\'s certainly not your average tower defense. What makes it fun/challenging is the bloons. Knowing your enemy properties and spawn at which level will greatly increase the gameplay experience else its going to be bonkers.\n\n40 over maps playing solo can feel repetitive and boring. On harder maps, where you are required to play 80 levels or more (more time spent) can be a turn off after xxx hours.\n\nGoing co-op, you will have to stick with the map layout and without a proper way to communicate, can turn the game into a messy monkey business. Spamming of emoticons that doesnt make sense. I dont voice chat unless i am playing with my friends. in other words, playing online with public you have to bare with the: 1) map layout (free for all or play in a section of the map), 2) communication limitation 3) knowledge of the person..and style of play\ncan lead to a [b][u]painful[/u][/b] experience. \n\never played in a co-op map where one of the player just build 1 tower in a hard game map? \nor leaves immediately once the game starts?\nor mass tower hugging at the entrance? [b]vomits blood[/b]\n\nOn the other hand, if you are playing with knowledgeable people, you learn and have more fun. I wished there was a way to add them into your friend list. I would love to have more co-op maps that are free to play style than sections though.\n\nSo, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Bloon TD 6 is a no-monkey business, creative coconut mess that is fun. An easy 8/10.', 'monkee :)', 'Hours of endless fun from such a fun and original monkey tower defense game!

Due to this, as you can imagine, it was a little difficult to adapt to the games style in comparison to Battles, especially with the addition of heroes. However, this game has far surpassed all my expectations when I first purchased the game for only 99 cents. Despite thew extremely low cost, I have gotten an unprecedented amount of enjoyable gameplay, even in comparison to games that cost 20x as much. The gameplay is energetic, vibrant, and increasingly challenging in an incredibly fun way. The different monkeys all seem to be relatively balanced and the addition of three upgrade paths allows for an absurd amount of different unique play styles and setups. Every monkey has its own situational use you have to play the game to get more and more used to the different monkeys. The heroes mesh nicely with the game and the ranging difficulty of the maps allows for players to progress in skill at their own pace. On top of this, there are lots of cool community events and the game is even more of a blast when you play with friends. I would most certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and chill strategy game to play with your friends or solo.', 'monke', ""I don't know how it is I haven't played a Bloons Tower Defense game since the early 2000's, this is such a good time!

Spamming of emoticons that doesnt make sense. I dont voice chat unless i am playing with my friends. in other words, playing online with public you have to bare with the: 1) map layout (free for all or play in a section of the map), 2) communication limitation 3) knowledge of the person..and style of play\ncan lead to a [b][u]painful[/u][/b] experience. \n\never played in a co-op map where one of the player just build 1 tower in a hard game map? \nor leaves immediately once the game starts?\nor mass tower hugging at the entrance? [b]vomits blood[/b]\n\nOn the other hand, if you are playing with knowledgeable people, you learn and have more fun. I wished there was a way to add them into your friend list. I would love to have more co-op maps that are free to play style than sections though.\n\nSo, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Bloon TD 6 is a no-monkey business, creative coconut mess that is fun.

Due to this, as you can imagine, it was a little difficult to adapt to the games style in comparison to Battles, especially with the addition of heroes. However, this game has far surpassed all my expectations when I first purchased the game for only 99 cents. Despite thew extremely low cost, I have gotten an unprecedented amount of enjoyable gameplay, even in comparison to games that cost 20x as much. The gameplay is energetic, vibrant, and increasingly challenging in an incredibly fun way. The different monkeys all seem to be relatively balanced and the addition of three upgrade paths allows for an absurd amount of different unique play styles and setups. Every monkey has its own situational use you have to play the game to get more and more used to the different monkeys. The heroes mesh nicely with the game and the ranging difficulty of the maps allows for players to progress in skill at their own pace. On top of this, there are lots of cool community events and the game is even more of a blast when you play with friends. I would most certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and chill strategy game to play with your friends or solo.', 'monke', ""I don't know how it is I haven't played a Bloons Tower Defense game since the early 2000's, this is such a good time!

Mods just add more to the game and most of them are great and some are must haves. 11/10 would buy again.\n\nWhat follows are semi coherent ramblings about the game, read at your own peril.\n\n[spoiler]\n\nRimworld is infinitely replayable. You start with several scenarios that give you a varying amount of ""pawns"" (your slaves to do with you want), techlevels and resources. You can generate planets and modify said generation making planets tropical paradises, hellish deserts or frozen wastelands. When you get tired of the basic scenarios you can also make your own. Want your pawn(s) to start a drug addict and fight for survival while going through withdrawal? You can do that. Want your pawn(s) to be bionic super soldiers hell bent on destroying the planet.... that is possible too. You can play as wanderers or colonists or a mixture of both styles. And with the dev tools available ingame you can easily modify the game while you play it, putting even more chaos into the mix. You can do everything from spawning new pawns, animals and so on, to changing the weather, to making the map a peaceful paradise...... (sorry, the warcriminal in me cringed a bit).\n\nObviously you can play on peaceful and turn it into a game of building and designing colonies or to exploring the world. Or you can play on the highest difficulty with ironman enabled to challenge your skill, your nerves and most importantly: your luck. Here once again Rimworlds easy customizability comes into play, permitting you to tailor the difficulty to your prefered playstyle, even mid game. And once you get tired (not that that is possible) of the game, you can istall mods to change everything or very little. New species, more animals, better interfaces (RimHud be praised), new weapons, rebalances for practically everything in the game and mods that totally change the game or the setting.\nRimworld as I now understand it, is about making a story, about leading your pawns as good as you can so they might survive another day (or torturing them into insanity, turning them into drug addicts and cold blooded murders or harvesting their organs one by one). As one of the tooltips of the game says ""A destroyed colony is not a failure, it is a tradegy"" (didnt look it up so it probably isnt 100% accurate).\n\nAs you play all pawns (on the map) interact socially and build relationships and connections. Those relationships then influence their interactions and what they think of the others. These interactions as other interactions with the world influence their happiness (mood) which can, when it falls below a certain threshold, lead to mental breaks. These mental breaks are varied and can go from aimless wandering to muderous rage where the pawn wont stop until their target is dead or the are killed (or arrested). \n\n\nI wont go into the carfting, building or research but suffice to say there are many options to pick from, many choices to be made when crafting or building and plenty of research to be researched.\n\nAll these interactions give flavor to the the world and it inhabitants. It can happen that a family member of one of your pawns comes and visits you, peacefully or with the intention of destroying everything you have. Out of these interactions a story is crafted. (A certain mod makes these interactions more visible by giving your pawns speachbubbles so you can easily read how they interact.)\nAfter I figured this out I stopped building absurd over the top bases and instead focused more on my pawns and fullfilling their needs and seeing how they interact. Back then I tended to have my speed at x3 so stuff got built faster, which lead to me missing practically all interactions and only being able to see the consequences. I now play on x1 most of the time and watch them go about their work, chatting, flirting or insulting the pawns they pass or share work space with. It is far more engaging then playing it as a rts or something similiar.\n\nAnd the Royalty DLC adds many new things and several new playstyles\nSo yeah, worth every cent. This game gave me the best money to time spent ratio of all my games\nRandy Random/10 would play again\n \n[/spoiler]', 'Alright, I took my time and I think I finally have a good grasp on my thoughts about this game. I\'ll try to keep them short and to-the-point.\n\nThis is one of those games I\'ve spent quite a bit more hours in than I\'d like to admit. Not because the game is bad or embarrassing or anything -- it\'s because I feel a little bit weird about having so many games collecting dust in my library and then never ""finding the time or energy"" to even boot them, but then I have titles like rimworld that I\'ve somehow found that ""time and energy"" in abundance.\n\nOn the surface the game seems either casual or overly complex, depending on which stage of playing it you are currently in. Before buying this game, it seemed casual (likely attributed to the art style) and after I finally clocked my first hour in, I had to admit it seemed a bit too complex for a simple man like me.\n\nThis is, however, just a charade. The game is neither casual nor overly complex. The game is very nicely balanced in its complexity and the generally great (although not very aesthetically pleasing) GUI plays a big part in that. \n\nNow, my experience has been enhanced by mods from the very beginning. My very first (short-lived) playthrough was entirely vanilla, but as with most games, I quickly checked out the mods and just couldn\'t stop myself.\n\nThe best part of this game is the modding community and all the awesome mods that we\'ve had the pleasure to play with and experience. And I\'m not even exaggerating that. It\'s absolutely amazing how much variety and even very specific little things we have. And there\'s no lack of absolutely gigantic mods with entirely new, complex and well-balanced mechanics. This is one of those games that actually benefit greatly from mods, and it has been developed in a way to make this possible. This is a very mod-friendly title and that is always a complete treat.\n\nOnce you get a grasp on the mechanics and what the game is about, it\'s an endless hole to throw your time in. It\'s even worse than civ in this regard, even if civ has the iconic ""one more turn"" phrase attached to it. And I shouldn\'t use the word ""worse"" -- it is indeed better for it.\n\nI\'ve never managed to get anywhere close to building the ship that seems to be the ultimate goal for this game. But I\'ve never even cared for ending the game honestly. All of my games, except for the first two more serious attempts, have been tribal starts with mods that make it a true ""start from the ancient times and slowly build up"" experience. I love the game in this form -- you start with barely enough technology to survive the first winter, and even if it is technically enough, it often turns out to be tricky to manage. The technologies advance so slow it plays no big part in this first huge problem/puzzle, though I\'m not sure if I\'ve always just had some mod that makes that harder than vanilla. But the point is -- I\'ve never, to this day, gotten very far in the technology tree in a true tribal/""ancient"" start. And I\'ve never felt like I\'ve been missing out or bored waiting for the technology to advance. It\'s exactly to the contrary.\n\nThe thing is, and this is the downside for me, the game is so gripping and slow in pace (which is an amazing thing) that every time I try to commit to a playthrough and actually get somewhere, something else in my life happens and I can\'t touch the game for months. Coming back after that, there\'s always either the fact that some mods no longer work either together or with the base game, or I\'ve completely forgot the entire story I had been building and no longer felt any connection to the save even if it did work after all that time. So I\'ve always just started again and again and again.\n\nAnd never have I been able to get very far.\n\nWhich is absolutely okay, for me anyway. The most fulfilling part of the game in my opinion is the beginning. You get to know the characters, their quirks, you carefully fine-tune the work priorities, the daily schedules, select a spot for the colony and just start living it, slowly building atop each small achievement or milestone. It\'s a very intriguing combination of planning, building, honing and expanding on all of those iteratively, decision after decision.\n\nAnd it\'s just a very gripping, fulfilling experience. More so than most games that I can think of.\n\nThis is a game that doesn\'t look like much, if you\'re used to triple-A level of graphics and UI. But the game itself is full of soul, full of possibilities and full of moments that\'ll make you feel something.\n\nIt\'s a game I would whole-heartedly suggest everyone sees for themselves. This might just be a game-changer for you too. Even if it isn\'t, I doubt you\'ll feel cheated of your time after you try it out.

So I\'ve always just started again and again and again.\n\nAnd never have I been able to get very far.\n\nWhich is absolutely okay, for me anyway. The most fulfilling part of the game in my opinion is the beginning. You get to know the characters, their quirks, you carefully fine-tune the work priorities, the daily schedules, select a spot for the colony and just start living it, slowly building atop each small achievement or milestone. It\'s a very intriguing combination of planning, building, honing and expanding on all of those iteratively, decision after decision.\n\nAnd it\'s just a very gripping, fulfilling experience. More so than most games that I can think of.\n\nThis is a game that doesn\'t look like much, if you\'re used to triple-A level of graphics and UI. But the game itself is full of soul, full of possibilities and full of moments that\'ll make you feel something.\n\nIt\'s a game I would whole-heartedly suggest everyone sees for themselves. This might just be a game-changer for you too. Even if it isn\'t, I doubt you\'ll feel cheated of your time after you try it out. I\'d even go as far as bet that you\'ll absolutely love it even if it doesn\'t stick.', 'dobra hra mam zatím 100h a zatím furt baví :D', 'bought the game, played literally the entire day and then passed out for 15 hours', 'Very enjoyable game.

QA should have caught these bugs long before this update was pushed out, and 2K should seriously reconsider its launcher and DRM policies considering how negatively they effect their paying customers.', '[h1] From Hero to Zero, how far this franchise has fallen [/h1]\n\nI have sat on writing this review for so long because of how much I have adored the Civilization franchise over the years, and how many wonderful hours I have spent preventing Ghandi\'s nuking philosophy in Civ 3,  fearing Montezuma\'s Jaguar rush in Civ 4, and holding the line on Diety difficulty with Haile Selasse in Civ 5. My only known quotient of time spent would be 2,000+ hrs on Civ 5.\n\nIt pains me to have to give a negative review for Civilization 6, even after I have given so much time for them to improve the game to a quality standard - far longer then it took with expansions from previous iterations. There are a few things I find enjoyable as a base: the graphic style, the district system, and the AI (although not close to perfect) is a step forward from previous iterations - especially from a tactical stand point. Instead of building off what are some promising systems, the publisher and developer continue to push this product towards a flaming pile of garbage. Here are my general opinions on the current state of this game.\n\n[u] Too much depth, not enough substance [/u] \n\nFiraxis (and likely directed by 2K Games) have chosen to move towards fluff instead of fibre. From the first instalment of Civilization 6, there has been fundamental flaws with the economic system like no other previous version has had. Production is broken - period. There is no other resource in this game that will guarantee you victories like stacking production into oblivion. Gold is far too inflated right from the start of a match, meaning that by mid game you are seeing costs that are so unnecessarily high that you need an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of purchasing goals. Faith is a rollercoaster - some Ages it is worthless, and other Ages it is overpowering. What was an interesting transition in Civ 5 to bring in tourism, has completely forced culture generation in Civ 6 to be limited in value; additionally, the great work and great person system is far less enjoyable as it\'s functionally has been complicated and reduced (respectively). These are the [b] base [/b] resources for the game, and since the OG version, Firaxis has only doubled down on inflating the complexity by adding [b] far more [/b] resources to counter balance, instead of attempting to resolve their broken economics. A shame really, as previous iterations of Civ worked on resolving their flaws with each expansion.\n\n[u] The Frontier F-up [/u]\n\nWell, what hasn\'t been said on any other game with predatory DLC practices. This sits there right up with another known developer that sounds like a ""pair of ducks"". After completing 3 expansions, and having all the flaws as said above, Firaxis pushed a non-requested DLC package on to players with [i] new features [/i] that would [i] improve the game [/i]. At the same time, a game breaking exploit that was well known for years by players and was repeatedly advised to Firaxis was ignored. As such, when the DLC was released and the company was (deservedly) given poor reviews on the state of the product, they finally fixed this exploit. Additionally, the content provided took away from the existing systems and created new ones. The civs and leaders added were far more powerful then what was existing in the game. Then to rub salt in the wound, Firaxis would seemingly do something that has truly pushed me to this bad review.\n\n[u] Multiplayer is [b] unplayable [/b] [/u]\n\nThis catastrophe finally did it for me. I\'ve never really been huge into multiplayer to be fair. Most of my hours spent over the years has been in solo play. But when I have played with friends, it has been some of the most competitive, humorous, and yet relaxing game play I have experience. The Frontier Pass, and whatever changes it made in the game, has now made the multiplayer so laggy I feel like I\'m back playing OG Starcraft on dial up. It is completely unacceptable to have the end of my turn not complete until other players have nearly finished their turn, due to the lag. What the hell Firaxis?!? Are they seriously unaware as to how much this coding mess has created with all these brand new ""bells and whistles"" fluff like secret societies, industries, and random meteor showers? If they are aware, it sure is silence on their part. But of course, new events and influencer videos should fix my frustrations with it, right? (pardon the salty sarcasm)\n\n[b] Lesson learned - if it\'s broke, just don\'t buy it [/b]\n\nTo wrap this up, I am now dissuaded from playing the product I bought, encouraged to play the previous version of Civilization, and resolved to not purchase anything further from Firaxis until they have demonstrated that a quality product can be made. It is unfortunate, as it is likely the publisher (2K, I\'m still calling you out too) forcing these decisions to be made in the way they are. \n\nIf you care about quality, buy Civilization 5, or Civilization 4 even. Both are gems of their time, hopefully not to be lost forever due to another money grab.', 'New EULA:\n""The information we collect may include personal information such as your first and/or last name, e-mail address, phone number, photo, mailing address, geolocation, or payment information.

That doesn't sit right with me. I would love to see more historical scenarios but firaxis isn't expanding on them anymore. \n\nFrom the start, Civilization VI felt outbalanced. District adjacencies will cause a player to massively outpace others. It isn't normal that I find myself with aircrafts and my buddies with swordsmen despite playing on different difficulty levels. The art is terrible with this mobile game feel to it but at least there are mods for that.\n\nI'm waiting for a Civilization VII and I'm hoping they correct course and go back to what I loved about this game. Otherwise, I think I'll stick with their competitors like Paradox (Crusader Kings, Hearts of Iron) or Amplitude (Endless legends, Humankind)."", ""Do not recommend this game until the 2K launcher is removed and the game can launch through Steam again. I've managed to get the game to work 1/2 the time by launching directly from the Steam Files' .exe rather than using Steam, but that's just. Honestly absurd for a game that worked fine without a separate launcher. I shouldn't have to troubleshoot for 10-15 minutes to get a Steam game to run."", ""I got a notification that Civilization 6 will collect my data and ship it to other countries that may not have the same level of privacy collection.\n\nI uninstalled the game right then and there, too bad I can't get a refund."", 'Was the game great ? I may never know.  Is 2K  the Problem or just the hours that it will take to fix this Joke of a update. Until they fix it I would suggest A Thumbs Down Review. Remember Steam is stuck just like we are so leave a thumbs down at 2K and firaxis . They are the cause of this.', 'I\'ve been playing this game from the very beginning. Its had some downs in the past with certain bugs/balance changes and sometimes the DLC model is a bit pricey, but all in all it was a fun experience. Until the most recent update completely broke the game. \n\nThe final game update has been causing all sorts of problems for players across the board, from crashing and performance issues to broken maps and content: True Start Location (TSL) are busted for many players, some game mode combinations cause the game to crash during loading, map generation can get stuck in a infinite loop, and some people can\'t even get into the game at all.\n\nOn top of having Civ 6\'s final update falling flat on its face, 2K has decided to implement a brand new launcher. Feature complete with always on DRM for paying customers convenience, causing no end of stability and performance issues both in the launcher and in-game (if you can even get the game to load).\n\nIt hurts to ""not recommend"" Civ 6 after getting so much enjoyment out of it, but in its current state I can\'t. QA should have caught these bugs long before this update was pushed out, and 2K should seriously reconsider its launcher and DRM policies considering how negatively they effect their paying customers.', '[h1] From Hero to Zero, how far this franchise has fallen [/h1]\n\nI have sat on writing this review for so long because of how much I have adored the Civilization franchise over the years, and how many wonderful hours I have spent preventing Ghandi\'s nuking philosophy in Civ 3,  fearing Montezuma\'s Jaguar rush in Civ 4, and holding the line on Diety difficulty with Haile Selasse in Civ 5. My only known quotient of time spent would be 2,000+ hrs on Civ 5.\n\nIt pains me to have to give a negative review for Civilization 6, even after I have given so much time for them to improve the game to a quality standard - far longer then it took with expansions from previous iterations. There are a few things I find enjoyable as a base: the graphic style, the district system, and the AI (although not close to perfect) is a step forward from previous iterations - especially from a tactical stand point. Instead of building off what are some promising systems, the publisher and developer continue to push this product towards a flaming pile of garbage. Here are my general opinions on the current state of this game.\n\n[u] Too much depth, not enough substance [/u] \n\nFiraxis (and likely directed by 2K Games) have chosen to move towards fluff instead of fibre. From the first instalment of Civilization 6, there has been fundamental flaws with the economic system like no other previous version has had. Production is broken - period. There is no other resource in this game that will guarantee you victories like stacking production into oblivion. Gold is far too inflated right from the start of a match, meaning that by mid game you are seeing costs that are so unnecessarily high that you need an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of purchasing goals. Faith is a rollercoaster - some Ages it is worthless, and other Ages it is overpowering. What was an interesting transition in Civ 5 to bring in tourism, has completely forced culture generation in Civ 6 to be limited in value; additionally, the great work and great person system is far less enjoyable as it\'s functionally has been complicated and reduced (respectively). These are the [b] base [/b] resources for the game, and since the OG version, Firaxis has only doubled down on inflating the complexity by adding [b] far more [/b] resources to counter balance, instead of attempting to resolve their broken economics. A shame really, as previous iterations of Civ worked on resolving their flaws with each expansion.\n\n[u] The Frontier F-up [/u]\n\nWell, what hasn\'t been said on any other game with predatory DLC practices. This sits there right up with another known developer that sounds like a ""pair of ducks"". After completing 3 expansions, and having all the flaws as said above, Firaxis pushed a non-requested DLC package on to players with [i] new features [/i] that would [i] improve the game [/i]. At the same time, a game breaking exploit that was well known for years by players and was repeatedly advised to Firaxis was ignored. As such, when the DLC was released and the company was (deservedly) given poor reviews on the state of the product, they finally fixed this exploit. Additionally, the content provided took away from the existing systems and created new ones. The civs and leaders added were far more powerful then what was existing in the game. Then to rub salt in the wound, Firaxis would seemingly do something that has truly pushed me to this bad review.\n\n[u] Multiplayer is [b] unplayable [/b] [/u]\n\nThis catastrophe finally did it for me. I\'ve never really been huge into multiplayer to be fair. Most of my hours spent over the years has been in solo play. But when I have played with friends, it has been some of the most competitive, humorous, and yet relaxing game play I have experience. The Frontier Pass, and whatever changes it made in the game, has now made the multiplayer so laggy I feel like I\'m back playing OG Starcraft on dial up. It is completely unacceptable to have the end of my turn not complete until other players have nearly finished their turn, due to the lag. What the hell Firaxis?!? Are they seriously unaware as to how much this coding mess has created with all these brand new ""bells and whistles"" fluff like secret societies, industries, and random meteor showers? If they are aware, it sure is silence on their part. But of course, new events and influencer videos should fix my frustrations with it, right? (pardon the salty sarcasm)\n\n[b] Lesson learned - if it\'s broke, just don\'t buy it [/b]\n\nTo wrap this up, I am now dissuaded from playing the product I bought, encouraged to play the previous version of Civilization, and resolved to not purchase anything further from Firaxis until they have demonstrated that a quality product can be made. It is unfortunate, as it is likely the publisher (2K, I\'m still calling you out too) forcing these decisions to be made in the way they are. \n\nIf you care about quality, buy Civilization 5, or Civilization 4 even. Both are gems of their time, hopefully not to be lost forever due to another money grab.', 'New EULA:\n""The information we collect may include personal information such as your first and/or last name, e-mail address, phone number, photo, mailing address, geolocation, or payment information.

I remember seeing a YouTube let\'s play series of this game with the Republic at War mod almost a decade ago when I was 9 years old, and I knew I had to get it. I ordered a copy that may have been a tad bit overpriced off ebay and played it for countless hours that aren\'t on steam (Except I couldn\'t figure out how to make mods work back then so I didn\'t end up playing republic at war until years later). A few years later I got a massive Star Wars bundle on Steam for sale, and this was in it. I proceeded to put hundreds of more hours into this game. \n\nThere isn\'t much else to say that hasn\'t been said in the other reviews. It\'s incredibly satisfying to take over the galaxy, building up your army to colossal proportions. The space combat in particular is intense, fun, and strategic. The same cannot be said about the ground combat, however. Most of the time I end up auto-resolving land battles, which sucks because I feel like the ground vehicles and weapons in Star Wars deserve a lot more love than they get. Also, the management of your empire should be more involved. You can\'t start trade routes, you can\'t make laws or policies, and there are no systems in place that take into consideration the population of your empire. No public unrest, or amenities, or even unhappiness. All of the buildings you build go towards either the economy or warfare. It would be so cool to build arenas like the one in Attack of the Clones, or government buildings on Coruscant. Just anything really. I would go so far as to say that the galaxy overview is just barely a step above the main menu, mainly being a vessel to bring you to battles. However, it\'s important to remember that the game is 15 years old now, and many of the features I just talked about weren\'t as common or developed in the genre. I just really wish there was a little more focus on the ""Empire"" aspect in ""Empire at War"". \n\nAfter all that negative, it may seem like I don\'t really like the game, but that\'s not true at all. The ability to use heroes is really cool, and it\'s fun using characters you wouldn\'t expect, like old man obi-wan, or yoda. Some heroes can also smuggle credits or steal technologies, which adds a little more depth to them. Along with the unexpected nature of some heroes, there are some weird vehicles and planets in this game, a lot of them being their only appearance outside of books and comics. Also, the modding community is top-notch. The work that some of these people do is phenomenal, and it really turns this game into something truly special. The quantity of mods is nowhere near Minecraft or Skyrim levels, but the quality is unreal. \n\nOverall, I\'d give the vanilla game a low 7/10 maybe even a 6.5. I have a lot of nostalgia for it, but there are definitely a lot of flaws. With mods, however, I\'d give it an 8.5 or a 9. Even though it\'s my favorite Star Wars game, I don\'t think it\'s the best. The space combat is amazing, and the modding community is awesome, but the issues I have with the game would require a full on remake or sequel (sidenote: this should definitely happen) to be fixed. I would really only recommend this game to Star Wars fans (which granted is a massive group of people), but if you\'re just a strategy fan, I\'d say avoid it unless it\'s on a deep sale.', ""I've owned this game since its original release a LOOONG time ago (as in physical disks well before the Steam era), and it's still one of the best RTS's out there.

I suggest to also install either or both Thrawns Revenge and Fall of the Republic Mods. These are possibly some of the best addons for the game. Any Star Wars fan or non Star Wars who who enjoys strategy games would really enjoy this early 2000's masterpiece. Enjoy being the next Grand Moff Tarkin, Darth Vader, Mon Mothma or Admiral Ackbar. This is not a trap. B)"", 'This game is and probably always will be my favorite Star Wars game. I remember seeing a YouTube let\'s play series of this game with the Republic at War mod almost a decade ago when I was 9 years old, and I knew I had to get it. I ordered a copy that may have been a tad bit overpriced off ebay and played it for countless hours that aren\'t on steam (Except I couldn\'t figure out how to make mods work back then so I didn\'t end up playing republic at war until years later). A few years later I got a massive Star Wars bundle on Steam for sale, and this was in it. I proceeded to put hundreds of more hours into this game. \n\nThere isn\'t much else to say that hasn\'t been said in the other reviews. It\'s incredibly satisfying to take over the galaxy, building up your army to colossal proportions. The space combat in particular is intense, fun, and strategic. The same cannot be said about the ground combat, however. Most of the time I end up auto-resolving land battles, which sucks because I feel like the ground vehicles and weapons in Star Wars deserve a lot more love than they get. Also, the management of your empire should be more involved. You can\'t start trade routes, you can\'t make laws or policies, and there are no systems in place that take into consideration the population of your empire. No public unrest, or amenities, or even unhappiness. All of the buildings you build go towards either the economy or warfare.
