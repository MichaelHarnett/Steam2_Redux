  <li><b>prelim_testing:</b> This notebook is my first notebook used. I explored how Steam's API worked, while also testing the various NLP methods we learned, including CountVectorizer TfidfVectorizer, LSA, and NMF.</li>
  <li><b>scraping_notebook:</b> The final notebook used to create my corpus. A combination of scraping SteamPowered.com and pulling reviews from Steam's API </li>
  <li><b>model_testing:</b> Used for hpyer-parameter tuning on final corpus, to extract most useable number of coherent topics.</li>

For this Metis module, we are focused on natural language processing and unsupervised learning. I thought it would be fun to re-visit Steam. As opposed to building a linear regression model, this time I am to create a recommendation engine, based on topics extracted from reviews for the most popular games in each genre.
